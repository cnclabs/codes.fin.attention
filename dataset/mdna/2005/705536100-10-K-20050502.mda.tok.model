the following should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k 
highlights consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  an decrease from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to lower product licensing fees and engineering services revenues  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from the company s application specific integrated circuits asics 
product licensing revenues decreased as a result of decreased demand for oem s products containing the company s technologies  which resulted from the shift in demand from monochrome to color technologies and with oems developing their own solutions in monochrome product offerings 
engineering services revenues also decreased in fiscal year due to lack of design wins 
product licensing revenues for fiscal year were million  including million of block licenses  a decrease of from the previous fiscal year 
fourteen block licensing agreements totaling million were signed during fiscal year  million of which was recognized as revenue during fiscal year the remaining million will be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year the company launched its new everest controller product utilizing peerless sierra technologies in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and  subsequent to january   the company obtained a design win in a memorandum of understanding mou with kyocera mita corporation that would involve the development of future products utilizing peerless sierra technologies 
the company believes that these events will lead to validation of the company s color offering  which will facilitate future oem design wins  and subsequent licensing revenues 

table of contents engineering services and maintenance contract backlog at january  was approximately million  this compares to million as of january   the low level reflecting the lack of design wins in fiscal years and subsequent to january   the company entered into a binding mou with kyocera mita that includes minimum payments of million per year for the next three years for engineering services 
on february   the company announced the sale of its remaining interest in netreon 
as a result of the sale  the company recorded in other income a gain of  net of expenses  associated with this transaction in the first quarter of fiscal year the company had announced the divestiture of its netreon storage management operations on january   effective january  peerless retained the networking technology obtained from the company s acquisition of netreon for continuing integration into peerless core document imaging products 
as a result of the divestiture  the company experienced a decline in operating expenses of approximately in fiscal year from levels experienced during fiscal year because the effective date of the divestiture so closely approximated the company s year end  the fiscal year consolidated results of operations included netreon s results for the entire year 
while the company continued to improve on and support its core monochrome imaging operations and technologies  it also continued to increase its focus on developing its new high performance color architecture peerless sierra technologies 
the company began shipping a new everest controller for the konica minolta bizhub tm during fiscal year to konica minolta dealers 
as a result of this and the kyocera mita mou  the company believes that on a going forward basis revenue generated from the company s peerless sierra technologies will begin to increase as a percentage of total revenue 
general the company generates revenue from its oems through the sale of imaging solutions in either turnkey or sdk form 
historically  oem demand for turnkey solutions had exceeded demand for sdk solutions 
however  in the fiscal year  the company experienced a shift in demand away from turnkey solutions towards demand for the company s sdks  particularly for its mature monochrome solutions 
the company has attempted to expand its high performance color solutions  by seamlessly incorporating the company s networking technologies and related imaging technologies licensed from third parties 
the company s product licensing revenues are comprised of both recurring per unit and block licensing revenues and development licensing fees for source code or sdks 
licensing revenues are derived from per unit fees paid periodically by the company s oem customers upon manufacturing and subsequent commercial shipment of products incorporating the company s technology 
licensing revenues are also derived from arrangements in which the company enables third party technology  such as solutions from adobe or novell  to be used with the company and or oem products 
block licenses are per unit licenses made in large volume quantities to an oem for products either in or about to enter into distribution into the marketplace 
payment schedules for block licenses are negotiable and payment terms are often dependent on the size of the block and other terms and conditions of the block license being acquired 
typically  payments are made in either one lump sum or over a period of four or more quarters 
revenue received for block licenses is recognized in accordance with sop  which requires that revenue be recognized after acceptance by the oem and if fees are fixed and determinable and the collection of fees is probable 
for block licenses that have a significant portion of the payments due within twelve months  revenue is recognized at the time the block license becomes effective 
the company also has engineering services revenues that are derived primarily from adapting the company s software and supporting electronics to specific oem requirements 
the company provides its engineering services to oems seeking a turnkey imaging solution for their digital document products 
the company s maintenance revenues are derived from software maintenance agreements 
maintenance revenues currently constitute a small portion of total revenue 

table of contents as part of the total solution offered to its oems  the company developed a direct distribution channel for its asic chips 
under this fabless model  peerless supplies asic chips from the foundry directly to the oems through third party distributors  which include arrow electronics and marubun corporation 
the company is responsible for marketing and sales administration  including the billings and collections to and from its oems and distributors  and the third party is responsible for the coordination of production with the foundry  maintenance of necessary inventories  and providing just in time delivery to oems and distributors 
the company derives revenues from the sale of controllers for mfp devices 
peerless sells its controllers to certain oem dealers for distribution to end users 
because it is a relatively new product  the company has been unable to establish a history regarding returns of the products shipped 
therefore  the company recognizes revenue only upon sales through to end users 
historically  a limited number of customers have provided a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
therefore  the availability and successful closing of new contracts  or modifications and additions to existing contracts with these customers may materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations from quarter to quarter 
peerless technology has addressed the worldwide market for monochrome printers pages per minute  or ppm and mfp ppm 
this market has been consolidating  and the demand for the monochrome technology and products offered by the company declined throughout fiscal year the company believes that unit volume for these types of printers will grow at lower rates than in past years 
available data indicate that retail prices are declining in these segments 
there has been a decline in the number of monochrome contracts that the company has with oems under which the company is currently performing services and granting licenses  and this decline is likely to continue along with the demand for the monochrome technology and products the company presently offers 
competitors have merged into larger business units with the resulting strength to acquire and impose a competitive advantage in the company s market segments 
sales decreased during fiscal year  as the company is continuing to meet sales resistance from its customers 
in the past  oems have reduced the absolute number of new products being developed and in some instances  oems have preferred to perform in house development projects for the products that they are developing and or planning to launch 
although there have been fewer opportunities for the company to sell its turnkey services and sdks  the company continued to support its current oem controller customers in the digital printing devices business with its existing technology and has sized the organization to provide the necessary support and maintenance 
in response to the company s belief that the demand for the company s core monochrome offerings may grow at lower rates than in past years and that the company may continue to meet sales resistance from its customers  peerless has recently developed and commercialized high performance color imaging and printing technologies and a new open architecture named peerless sierra technologies 
peerless believes that products based on its peerless sierra technologies address key growth areas in the imaging market including increased demand for color imaging  the emergence of mfps  and continued demand for faster low cost monochrome printing solutions  to which many of the peerless sierra technologies attributes are applicable 
during the last fiscal year  peerless launched a new mfp controller product  everest  containing peerless sierra technologies into the marketplace 
peerless believes that the launch of its high performance color mfp controller into the distribution channels will be followed by sales to oems for utilization of its high performance color technology  with licensing revenues beginning in fiscal year see  however  if the company is unable to achieve its expected level of sales of peerless sierra technologies on a timely basis  the company s future revenue and operating results may be harmed and if the marketplace does not accept peerless new peerless sierra technologies  the company s future revenues and operating results may be harmed in the section entitled certain factors and trends affecting peerless and its business of this annual report on form k 
peerless believes that its new peerless sierra technologies will contribute an increasing percentage of the company s overall revenue in the future 

table of contents the company has addressed the deterioration in the demand for its solutions by investing in leading edge technologies  by sizing its organization to manage the current business requirements of imaging for digital document products and has adapted its pricing model to changing market conditions 
the company has also addressed the deterioration in revenues by expanding its offerings in new geographic regions and in distribution channels 
in addition  as a result of the complexities of the imaging industry  the company continues to explore opportunities to enhance the value of the company  including new market opportunities  mergers  acquisitions and or the sale of all or a portion of company s assets 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for its software revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
over the past two years  the company entered into block license agreements that represent unit licenses for products that will be licensed over a period of time 
in accordance with sop  revenue is recognized when the following attributes have been met an agreement exists between the company and the oem selling product utilizing the company s intellectual property and or a third party s intellectual property for which peerless is an authorized licensor  delivery and acceptance of the intellectual property has occurred  the fees associated with the sale are fixed and determinable and collection of the fees are probable 
under the company s accounting policies  fees are fixed and determinable if of the fees are to be collected within a twelve month period  in accordance with sop if more than of the payments of fees extend beyond a twelve month period  they are recognized as revenues when they are due for payment  in accordance with sop as of january   the company had no such revenues to be recognized in future periods 
the company recognizes revenues for certain of its engineering services projects on a percentage of completion basis  in accordance with accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the estimates to complete the projects are determined by the individual project engineering manager responsible for the oversight of the individual projects 
the estimates are made at the end of each accounting period and are subject to unforeseen circumstances that can increase or decrease the hours necessary to complete the efforts 
for fiscal year  the company reported no engineering services revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
the company derives revenues from the shipments of its controllers to certain dealers of oem mfp devices 
because the product is relatively new  peerless has been unable to establish a history of returns of the products by the dealers 
therefore  the company recognizes revenues for these shipments only upon the sale of the controllers through to end users 

table of contents the company provides an accrual for estimated product licensing costs owed to third party vendors whose technology is included in the products sold by the company 
the accrual is impacted by estimates of the mix of products shipped under certain of the company s block license agreements 
the estimates are based on historical data and available information as provided by the company s customers concerning projected shipments 
should actual shipments under these agreements vary from these estimates  adjustments to the estimated accruals for product licensing costs may be required 
such losses have historically been within management s expectations 
as of january   the company had net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future federal and state income of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in fiscal years for federal and for state  respectively 
in addition  as of january   the company had tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future income tax liabilities of approximately million  which begin to expire in fiscal year the realization of these assets is based upon management s estimates of future taxable income 
the company has provided a valuation allowance for all of its net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to the company s ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
with a change in management s assessment of the uncertainty  the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly 
the company grants credit terms in the normal course of business to its customers 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of any customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based primarily on specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of any of the company s customers  or the economy as a whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
the company s recurring product licensing revenues are dependent  in part  on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from the company s oem customers 
these reports are provided only on a calendar quarter basis and  in any event  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  the company is required to estimate all of the recurring product licensing revenues for the last month of each fiscal quarter and to further estimate all of its quarterly revenues from an oem when the report from such oem is not received in a timely manner 
in the event the company is unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to reporting financial results  the company may be required to adjust revenues in subsequent periods 
fiscal year revenues subject to such estimates were minimal 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
the valuation of the company s inventory is dependent on its ability to estimate the level of future sales of its peerless sierra technologies based controllers 
although the company believes that it has enough information to estimate such sales  the product s sales history is short  and  if actual results differ materially from the estimates  the company may be required to adjust its valuation of its inventory 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of certain items from the company s statements of operations to total revenues

net income net loss for the twelve month period ended january  was million or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal year  and net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal year revenues consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decreases in both periods were primarily attributable to decreased licensing and engineering services revenues  which were partially offset by higher asics revenues 

table of contents product licensing revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year block licensing agreements totaling million were signed during fiscal year  of which million was recognized as revenue during the year 
the remaining million will be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year this is compared with block licensing agreements of million signed in fiscal year  all of which was recognized as revenue during fiscal year the decreases in product licensing revenue in fiscal years and are mainly attributable to the decrease in demand for the oems products containing the company s core monochrome technology 
engineering services and maintenance revenues generated by the company were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decreases were primarily the result of a lack of design wins for the company s peerless sierra technologies 
revenue generated by asic sales was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year contract and maintenance backlog at january  was approximately million  as compared with million at january  cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year product licensing costs were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decreases in fiscal years and as compared to fiscal years and  respectively  were due to decreased product licensing revenues and lower levels of third party technologies in those revenues than in the previous comparable years 
in fiscal year  the company recorded an additional accrual for the settlement of certain third party licensing costs totaling million 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was due primarily to a proportionately higher level of peerless intellectual property in its licensing revenues  resulting in a lower cost of sales 
the decrease in fiscal year was largely due to higher levels of product licensing costs for third party technology associated with certain of the company s licensing revenues 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year research and development expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year in fiscal year  expenditures increased early in the fiscal year  as development of the company s peerless sierra technologies continued 
however  as the development effort neared its completion  research and development expenditures decreased in the ensuing quarters as compared to the comparable prior year s quarters  resulting in a small decrease from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to higher staffing and consulting costs associated with the development of the company s peerless sierra technologies 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year was the result of a reduction in staffing levels 
the company continued to focus on the launch of peerless sierra technologies and on developing new oem customers  attending industry trade shows  and evaluating other opportunities to promote the company s core and new color imaging and network solutions 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was due primarily 
table of contents to increased consulting costs 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to the reduction of consulting costs 
in addition  during fiscal year  the company received a million insurance refund for costs associated with completed legal proceedings 
interest income  other income and expenses  and taxes interest income earned in all fiscal years was attributable to interest and investment income earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment balances 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily a result of a lower level of investments than in the previous fiscal year 
the decrease in fiscal year in interest income was due to lower yields on a lower level of the company s investments in government and corporate bonds 
included in other income in fiscal year was million from the company s sale of its remaining interest in netreon  inc  announced on february  in addition  the company recorded a gain of million associated with the termination of a sublease of a portion of its leased office space at its headquarters in el segundo  california 
additionally  the company recorded a  loss for a correction to fiscal year reported accrued interest 
the provisions for income taxes for all fiscal years were primarily the result of foreign income taxes paid 
these income taxes were paid through withholdings on payments of licensing revenues made by the company s customers to peerless 
in july  a new tax treaty between the united states and japan ended the requirement for such income taxes 
the effect was to nearly eliminate the company s foreign income tax provision in all periods subsequent to the effective date of the new treaty 
in fiscal year  the foreign income taxes paid were offset by the release of certain long term tax liabilities 
in fiscal year  the foreign income taxes paid were offset by the company s receipt of a tax benefit of million as a result of a change in the tax code that allowed the company to carry back losses to obtain a tax refund 
the company has provided a valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to the company s ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets at january  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations outstanding purchase orders total liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents and investments  which  as of january  were million in the aggregate  compared to million at january  the decrease was primarily the result of the net loss incurred during the year and the investment in inventory for the new peerless sierra technologies controllers  net of the timing of collections of accounts receivable 
compared to january   total assets at january  decreased to million and stockholders equity decreased to million 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was compared to last year 
the company used million in cash during the twelve month period ended january  from operations as compared to million in cash used by operations during the twelve month period ended january  
table of contents the company s investing activities during the fiscal year ended january  provided cash of million 
this is the result of the sales of investments to provide funds for the company s operations 
it is the company s policy to invest the majority of its unused cash in low risk government and commercial debt securities 
the company has not historically purchased derivative instruments or entered into hedging transactions 
for the twelve month period ended january   the company invested approximately million in property  equipment and leasehold improvements compared to million during the previous twelve month period 
during fiscal year  million was provided by the issuance of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal year and million in fiscal year at january   net trade receivables were million lower than at january   due primarily to the timing of the signings and collections of new licensing agreements at the end of the fiscal years 
in fiscal year  the company signed and collected significant agreements at the end of the year  in fiscal year  the company was unable to collect agreements signed at the end of the year 
as previously mentioned  subsequent to january   the company signed an mou with kyocera mita corporation 
the mou provides  among other things  for quarterly payments of million for the next three years for the development of future products 
during fiscal year  the company established a credit facility with its bank that allows for borrowing against outstanding receivables 
the credit facility generally only provides coverage for short term working capital needs and the company may require additional long term capital to finance working capital requirements 
the company expects cash and investments will increase during fiscal year the company expects the recently signed contract with kyocera mita to provide much of the increase  and  although the company expects the cash position to further increase with the expected sales growth associated with the peerless sierra technologies  there can be no assurances that the company will experience the anticipated increase in the peerless sierra technologies sales subsequent to january  the company expects to reduce operating expenses as a result of completion of the majority of the peerless sierra technologies development effort 
however  if the level of peerless sierra technologies sales is lower than anticipated  the company may need to take significant measures to preserve and maintain continued business operations 
in such event  the company may need to further reduce costs and may have to access the capital markets to raise additional funding 
there is no assurance that the company would be successful in raising capital at attractive terms or at all  and should the company be successful in raising capital  the financing may be dilutive to current shareholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   the company does not hold any positions in equity securities of other publicly traded companies 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the company s non equity investment portfolio 
the primary objectives of the company s investment activities are to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company from time to time maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents  fixed rate debt instruments of the federal  state  and local governments and high quality corporate issuers and short term investments in money market funds 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  as of january   the company held approximately million in corporate debt securities 
although the company is subject to interest rate risks in these investments  the company believes an effective increase or decrease of in interest rate percentages would not have a material adverse effect on its results from operations 
consequently  the company s interest rate risk is minimal 
the company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments 
currently all of the company s contracts  including those involving foreign entities  are denominated in us dollars and as a result  the 
table of contents company has experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date  and has no intention of doing so
