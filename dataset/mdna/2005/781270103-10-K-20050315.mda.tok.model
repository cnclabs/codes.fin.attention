item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a worldwide leader in the design  development  manufacture and support of process control metrology systems used in semiconductor device manufacturing 
our thin film measurement proprietary systems measure the thickness and other properties of thin films applied during various steps in the manufacture of integrated circuits  enabling semiconductor device manufacturers to improve yields and reduce overall production costs 
our macro defect inspection proprietary systems detect and classify defects in semiconductor wafers 
we provide our customers with a flexible full fab metrology solution by offering families of systems that meet their transparent and opaque thin film measurement and macro defect inspection needs in various applications across the fabrication process 
our three primary families of metrology solutions offer leading edge metrology technology  flexible systems cost effectively designed for specific manufacturing applications and a common production worthy automation platform  all backed by worldwide support 
our business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment 
the amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors  including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer and cell phone sales 
current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry project a year over year decrease in capital spending of for we monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly published industry data such as the book to bill ratio 
the book to bill ratio is a month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments 
a book to bill above one shows that equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period 
the north american semiconductor equipment book to bill ratio was for the month of december historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few end user customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
for the years ended  and sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for  and of our revenues  respectively 
for the years ended  and sales to intel accounted for  and of our revenues  respectively 
for  sales to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company accounted for of our revenues 

table of contents we do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligates them to continue to purchase our products  and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time 
a delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly 
in addition  during a given quarter  a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our transparent film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system  our opaque film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system and our macro defect inspection systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system 
accordingly  a small change in the number of systems we sell may also cause significant changes in our operating results 
because fluctuations in the timing of orders from our major customers or in the number of our individual systems we sell could cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly in any given quarter or year  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are necessarily meaningful  and they should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the united states  and we expect this trend to continue 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
we expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
effective october  we opened a new direct sales and support operation in japan 
the new operation offers our customers in japan a direct link to us 
we have established a main office in takatsu  japan  with branch operations in osaka and on kyushu island 
we currently have an installed base of more than metrology tools in japan 
tokyo electron limited previously served as our japanese distributor for over twenty years 
the transition from our distributor arrangement with tokyo electron limited is expected to take months 
as part of the transition  our operations will be staffed with some of the same support personnel that supported our products at tokyo electron limited 
our new operations in japan will have a negative impact on our gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses for at least the next several quarters until sufficient sales are generated to cover these additional costs 
the sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to months  and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology 
due to the length of these cycles  we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments 
additionally  the rate and timing of customer orders may vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  if sales of our products do not occur when we expect  and we are unable to adjust our estimates on a timely basis  our expenses and inventory levels may increase relative to revenues and total assets 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our statements of income data as percentages of our revenues 
our results of operations are reported as one reportable business segment 
year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development in process research and development selling  general and administrative amortization total operating expenses operating income loss interest income and other  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss results of operations  and revenues 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems  services  spare parts and licensing 
our revenues were million  million and million in the years  and these changes represent increases of from to and from to the following table lists the different sources of our revenue revenue type of revenue of revenue of revenue systems metrology inspection parts services licensing total revenue systems revenue decreased as a percentage of revenue from to due to a decrease in customer demands for our products as a result of the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
the increase in systems revenue from to from of revenues to of revenues was driven by improved customer demands for our products as a result of increased capital spending in the semiconductor device manufacturing sector this past year 
systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to of total revenue for parts and services revenues were slightly higher as a percentage of revenue from to and flat as a percentage of revenue from to parts and services revenues are generated from part sales  maintenance service contracts  as well as time and material 
table of contents billable service calls 
if the industry sustains a prolonged recovery  we expect systems revenues as a percentage of total revenue to increase and parts and service revenues as a percentage of total revenue to decrease as customers buy new equipment 
licensing revenue is derived from contracts obtained as a result of the acquisition of our yield metrology group in september licensing our technologies is not part of our core business strategy 
therefore  we expect licensing revenue to continue to be a small portion of our revenue 
gross profit 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write offs  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  product sales mix  production volume  international and domestic sales mix  and parts and service margins 
our gross profit was million  million and million in  and our gross profit represented  and of our revenues in  and the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to an increase in metal tool shipments  which typically have higher margins  and leverage generated by fixed manufacturing and customer service costs representing a smaller percentage of the overall cost of goods sold 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in licensing revenues and our investment in our direct sales and support operations in japan 
as a result of a transition arrangement with tokyo electron limited  effective october   we began the fourth quarter of with a fully staffed sales and service team 
our new operations in japan will have a negative impact on our gross profit for at least the next several quarters until sufficient sales are generated to cover these additional costs 
research and development 
the thin film transparent  opaque process control and macro defect inspection metrology market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations 
we believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products  including the transition to copper and low k dielectrics  the progression to mm wafers  the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions  and the evolution of ultra thin gate process control  is critical to our success 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our technical  management and financial resources to research and development programs 
research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
they also include consulting fees and the cost of related supplies 
our research and development expense was million  million and million in  and research and development expense represented  and of our revenues in  and the year over year dollar increase in research and development expenses from to resulted from the engineering team acquired from ymg being included for the full year of the year over year dollar increase from to primarily reflects higher compensation costs and an increase in product development costs 
we continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products as we position ourselves for future growth 
we anticipate research and development expense will be a similar amount in absolute dollars for the first quarter of as we continue to roll out new products 
in process research and development 
the acquisition of ymg resulted in our recording of a one time expense of million in for the write off of in process research and development iprd 
the iprd we acquired related to automated defect inspection technology to be used in stand alone and integrated metrology equipment 
at the time of the acquisition  we determined that the iprd had not reached technological feasibility and that it did not have an alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of loss upon the acquisition date 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales  marketing  and general administrative personnel  as well as commissions and other non personnel related expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and selling  general and administrative expense represented  and of our revenues in  and the year over year dollar increase from to in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to increased compensation costs  our investment in our direct sales and support operations in japan  increased administrative costs at our other branch 
table of contents offices and an increase in costs associated with sarbanes oxley section reporting requirements compliance 
our operations in japan will also have a negative impact on our ongoing selling  general and administrative expenses for the next several quarters 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net was million  million and million in  and interest income and other  net for consisted primarily of interest income  realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities  rental income and income from the settlement of the august technology lawsuit in the third quarter of the decrease in interest income and other  net of million from to is attributable to lower interest income of million  partially offset by higher realized gains on investments of million 
the increase in interest income and other  net of million from to is due to the litigation settlement income of million  higher interest income of million  higher rental income of million  offset by higher realized losses on sales of marketable securities of million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
income tax expense was million  million and million in  and our effective tax rate was  and in  and we computed our effective tax rate for through on prevailing federal and state rates adjusted for research and development tax credits and income derived from tax exempt interest 
our effective tax rate in also reflects the non deductibility of the iprd charge for tax purposes 
in addition  our effective tax rate in reflects a valuation allowance of million for a portion of the deferred tax assets attributable to foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards at december   due to the uncertainty of future earnings of our european subsidiary 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our generating sufficient taxable income in future years in europe to obtain the tax benefit of nol carryforwards 
due to uncertainties in the timing and amount of the realization of this deferred tax asset  we have provided a valuation allowance equal to of such deferred asset at december  liquidity and capital resources at december  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million  while working capital amounted to million 
at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in working capital 
at december  we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in working capital 
typically during periods of revenue growth  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers 
similarly  during periods of declining revenue  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected 
because of the lack of visibility in projected sales for  we are uncertain as to the level of expected cash from operating activities in  if any 
cash provided by operating activities in and was million and million  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in totaled million 
the net cash provided by operating activities during was primarily a result of increases in deferred revenue of million  accrued liabilities of million and profit before depreciation  amortization and the write off of iprd of million  partially offset by an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
cash provided by operating activities during was primarily due to net income of million combined with a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million  and a decrease in inventories of million 
cash provided from operating activities during was negatively affected by a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities and a decrease in deferred revenue 
net cash used in operating activities in was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  partially offset by profit before depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease of million in deferred taxes  an increase in accrued liabilities of million  an increase in other current liabilities of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and a decrease in income taxes receivable of million 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and net cash used in investing activities for included the acquisition of ymg  net of cash acquired  of million  a net increase in marketable securities of million and capital expenditures of million 
in  net cash used in investing activities included a net increase in marketable securities of million and capital expenditures of million 
in  net cash used in investing activities included a net increase in marketable securities of million  costs incurred for capitalized software of million and capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and net cash provided by financing activities in was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares  including sales of shares through employee stock plans and proceeds received from a director of the company in connection with his sale of the company s stock 
in and  net cash provided by financing activities was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares through employee stock plans 
from time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses  products and technologies  and we therefore could apply cash for investing activities in to consummate any such potential acquisition 
on january   august technology corporation announced it had entered into a merger agreement with nanometrics incorporated 
on january   we advised the board of august technology that we would be prepared to enter into a merger agreement with august technology whereby each shareholder would receive consideration consisting of per share in cash and a share in our common stock 
the total cash consideration would aggregate approximately million and the implied total purchase price would aggregate approximately million based upon the market value of our common stock on january  on february   kla tencor corporation announced it had advised the board of august technology that it was proposing to acquire august technology for per share in cash 
we currently intend to continue to seek to acquire august technology 
there can be no assurance that we will enter into a merger agreement with august technology  and if we do  the terms of any such agreement 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions  which will affect our ability to generate additional cash 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and research and development activities for the foreseeable future 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings  sales of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations open and committed purchase orders total off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our products are sold and accounted for as multiple element arrangements  consisting primarily of the sale of the product  installation and training services 
we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment 
when customer acceptance is subjective and not obtained prior to shipment  we defer product revenue until such time as positive affirmation of acceptance has been obtained from the customer 
customer acceptance is generally based on our products meeting published performance specifications 
the amount of revenue allocated to the shipment of products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered contract elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to product revenue 
the fair value of installation and training services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
revenue related to undelivered installation services is deferred until such time as installation is completed at the customer s site 
revenue related to training services is recognized ratably over the training period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or our assumptions are otherwise incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets and acquired intangible assets 
we periodically review long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year 
a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows 
table of contents and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and the impairment of such long lived assets  if any  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r will require us to expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 
sfas no 
r requires us to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in our third quarter of we are currently evaluating our share based employee compensation programs  the potential impact of this statement on our consolidated financial position and results of operations and the alternative adoption methods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist primarily of fixed income investments us treasury and agency securities and corporate bonds 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers from our available for sale securities 
it is possible that we are at risk if interest rates or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of december   an immediate adverse change of in interest rates eg to would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities 

table of contents foreign currency risk we have branch operations in taiwan  singapore  china and korea and wholly owned subsidiaries in europe and japan  which are subject to currency fluctuations 
we have determined that the functional currency of our foreign operations is the local currency in our international operations  which incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
these foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material 
a substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales 
as of october   substantially all our sales in japan are denominated in japanese yen 
from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject us to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
