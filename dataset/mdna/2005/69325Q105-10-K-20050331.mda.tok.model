introduction pctel is focused on growing wireless revenue and maximizing the monetary value of its intellectual property 
these are the two key priorities for the company in the company reports revenue and gross profit for apg  rfsg  msg  licensing and modems as separate product segments 
growth in wireless product revenue is dependent both on gaining further revenue traction in the existing product profile as well as further acquisitions to support the wireless initiatives 
revenue growth in the apg segment is tied to emerging wireless applications in broadband wireless  in building wireless  wireless internet service providers  gps and mobile satcom 
the lmr and on glass mobile antenna applications represent mature markets 
a critical factor for revenue growth is the successful absorption of the product lines purchased from andrew in october into apg 
revenue in the rfsg segment is tied to the deployment of new wireless technology  such as g and g  and the need for existing wireless networks to be tuned and reconfigured on a regular basis 
revenue growth in the msg segment is correlated to the success of data services offered by the customer base 
the company describes the roll out of such data services to be in the early stage of market development 
licensing revenue is dependent on the signing of new license agreements and the success of the licensees in the marketplace 
new licenses often contain up front payments pertaining to past royalty liability  or one time payments if the license is perpetual 
this can make licensing revenue uneven 
the company has found it necessary to enter into litigation from time to time as a means to bring companies under license 
the company is currently in litigation with agere  lucent and us robotics over the use of pctel s intellectual property 
this litigation is the single largest opportunity to maximize the monetary value of the company s intellectual property 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
revenue recognition the company sells antenna products  software defined radio products  wi fi and cellular mobility software products  and licenses the modem technology through the licensing program 
the company records the sale of these products  including related maintenance  and the licensing of the intellectual property as revenue 
in accordance with sab no 
 the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue for sales of the antenna products and software defined radio products  when title transfers  which is generally upon shipment from the factory 
pctel sells these products into both commercial and secure application government markets 
title for sales into the commercial markets generally transfer upon shipment from the factory 
products that are sold into the secure application government market are generally designed to a unique specification 
title for sales into the government markets generally does not transfer until acceptance of the first units and then upon shipment thereafter 
revenue is recognized for antenna products sold to major distributors upon shipment from the factory 
the company allows its major distributors to return product under specified terms and conditions 
the company accrues for product returns in accordance with fas  revenue recognition when right of return exists 
the company recognizes revenue from the wi fi and cellular mobility software  including related maintenance rights  under sop software revenue recognition 
if the software license is perpetual and vendor specific objective evidence can be established for the software license and any related maintenance rights  the software license revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software and the maintenance is recorded pro rata over the life of the maintenance rights 
if part of the licensing agreement requires engineering services to customize software for the customer needs  the revenue for these services is recognized when the initial software license is delivered 
if vendor specific objective evidence cannot be established  and the only undelivered item is maintenance  the software license revenue  the revenue associated with engineering services  if applicable  and the related maintenance rights are combined and recognized pro rata over the expected term of the maintenance rights 
if vendor specific evidence cannot be established on any of the non maintenance elements  the revenue is recorded pro rata over the life of the contractual obligation 
the company records intellectual property licensing revenue when  it has a licensing agreement  the amount of related royalties is known for the accounting period reported  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
knowledge of the royalty amount specific to an accounting period is either in the form of a royalty report specific to a quarter  a contractual fixed payment in the license agreement specific to a quarter  or the pro rata amortization of a fixed payment related to multiple quarters over those quarters using the operating lease method 
if a license agreement provides for a fixed payment related to periods prior to the license effective date the past and volume based royalties going forward  the fixed payment is recognized at the license effective date and the volume based royalties are recognized as royalty reports are received 
if the license provides for a fixed payment for the past and for a finite future period  to be followed by volume based royalties thereafter  the fixed payment is recorded under the operating lease method and recognized pro rata from the effective date through the end of the period covered by the fixed payment 
if a one time license payment is made for a perpetual license  with no future obligations on behalf of us  revenue is recognized under the capitalized lease method upon the effective date 
there is one exception to the above described recognition of intellectual property licensing as revenue 
the company signed a licensing agreement with conexant simultaneously with the sale of its hsp modem product line to conexant in because the hsp modem product line also requires a license to the company s patent portfolio  the gain on sale of the product line and the licensing stream are not separable for accounting purposes 
ongoing royalties from conexant are presented in the income statement as gain on sale of assets and related royalties 
inventory write downs and recoveries inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and overhead costs 
inventories as of december  and were composed of raw materials  subassemblies  work in process  and finished goods 
the company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand and  based on the current estimated requirements  it was determined that any excess inventory was reserved as of december  and due to competitive pressures and technological innovation  the company may have excess inventory in the future 
write downs of inventories would have a negative impact on gross profit 
accrued royalties the company records an accrual for estimated future royalty payments for relevant technology of others used in the product offerings in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the estimated royalties accrual reflects management s broader litigation and cost containment strategies  which may include alternatives such as entering into cross licensing agreements  cash settlements  or both  based upon the judgment that such negotiated settlements would allow management to focus more time and financial resources on the ongoing business 
accordingly  the royalties accrual reflects estimated costs of settling claims rather than continuing to defend the legal positions and is not intended to be  nor should it be interpreted as  an admission of infringement of intellectual property  valuation of damages suffered by any third parties or any specific terms that management has predetermined to agree to in the event of a settlement offer 
the company has accrued the amount of royalties payable for royalty agreements  agreements that are in negotiation and unasserted but probable claims of others using advice from third party advisors and historical settlement rates 
as of december  and  the company had accrued royalties of  and million  respectively 
the majority of the royalties are associated with the modem product line sold to conexant 
on a forward looking basis  the value of royalties is not expected to be significant 
stock based compensation the company accounts for the stock option plans using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  whereby compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of a share of the stock at the date of the grant over the amount that must be paid to acquire the stock 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  issued subsequent to apb no 
and amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options  but allows companies to continue to measure compensation cost for employees using the intrinsic value method of apb no 
the company does not expense stock options  but does expense restricted stock grants 
the company records the issuance of restricted stock grants based on the fair value on the date of the grant and amortizes the value over the life of the restriction using the straight line method 
as required by sfas no 
 the summary pro forma effects to reported income as if the company had elected to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock based awards to the company s employees is disclosed 
the calculation of the fair value of these awards is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the highly subjective assumptions underlying this model include expected stock price volatility and expected option life 
goodwill and impairment of long lived assets effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  under which goodwill is no longer amortized 
through a third party valuation firm the company assessed the need to record impairment losses on goodwill and long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present such as a significant industry downturn  significant decline in the market value of the company  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
at least annually  typically in the fourth quarter  the company reviews the value of goodwill and long lived assets and  additionally reviews the period of amortization or depreciation of long lived assets 
during this review  the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost of long lived assets are reevaluated 
the company determines whether there has been a permanent impairment of the value of long lived assets by comparing future estimated undiscounted cash flows to the asset s carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  a loss is recorded as the excess of the asset s carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
a third party valuation firm conducted the annual impairment test of goodwill and long lived assets as of october  the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows for this test was based on historical sales trends  financial projections  market analysis  capital expenditure needs  working capital needs  analyst reports  and other data pertinent to the valuation as provided by the company and obtained from public  financial  and industry sources 
the company s assumptions required significant judgment and actual cash flows may differ from those forecasted today 
the company believes the assumptions used for discounting future cash flows were appropriately conservative 
based on the results of the test  there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
income taxes the company provides for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are provided against tax assets  which are not likely to be realized 
the company has international subsidiaries located in japan  china and israel as well as international branch offices located in hong kong and taiwan 
the branch office in taiwan is presently in the liquidation process 
the complexities brought on by operating in several different tax jurisdictions inevitably lead to an increased exposure to worldwide taxes 
should review of the tax filings result in unfavorable adjustments to the company s tax returns  the operating results  cash flows  and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
the company believes there will not be any significant adjustments related to foreign taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate the income taxes  which involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the company maintains a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
in the event it was determined that the company could realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made

the chronological revenue trend by quarter within the year was   and million 
apg represents the company s largest revenue segment and is expected to continue as such in emerging technology applications such as broadband wireless  in building wireless  gps and mobile satcom are the drivers of growth in this segment 
the land mobile radio lmr and on glass mobile antenna products represent mature markets 
the company expects the revenue of this segment to grow in based on its investment and market presence in emerging technology applications  as well as the full year impact of owning the andrew product lines 
rfsg revenue was million in  up from the growth was driven by the full year impact of owning rfsg  which was purchased in march  and the full year impact of the clarify tm product line  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of the company expects the revenue in this segment to grow in from the roll out of g and g technologies by wireless network operators  increased market acceptance of its clarify tm product line  and penetration of secure government applications for its receiver technology 
msg revenue was million in  up from the growth was driven by the accumulation of contract wins for the company s roaming client product 
the roll out of data services in the customer base in and is characterized as early stage market development 
the company expects revenue growth in commensurate with the success of its customer base 
licensing revenue was million in  down from and up from licensing revenue is historically uneven  as licensing agreements often contain one time settlements for past infringement or perpetual licenses 
intel purchased a perpetual license for the company s patented technology in the fourth quarter of for million 
this segment continues to be affected by older licensing agreements related to modem technology 
absent resolution to the litigations with agere  lucent  and us robotics  licensing revenue is expected to continue to shrink in modem product revenue ceased in with the sale of the hsp product line to conexant 
management believes that modems should only be viewed in their historical context of the transition to wireless 
intercompany sales from apg to rfsg are eliminated in consolidation 
it is expected that intercompany sales will continue to be insignificant in gross profit apg rfsg msg licensing modems elimination consolidated gross profit       percentage of revenue na change from year ago period na na gross profit      percentage of revenue na na change from year ago period na na na percentage of revenue gross profit    percentage of revenue na na na change from year ago period na na na na gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was in  in  and in the gross profit associated with modems over these periods included favorable cost reserve recoveries of million in  million in  and million in additionally  gross profit included a million benefit from a one time licensing settlement with intel 
the company s product segments vary significantly from each other in gross profit percent 
the revenue mix without the modem cost recovery yielded a total company gross profit percentage of in it is expected that total gross profit as a percentage of revenue will settle in a range of to in  based on segment revenue mix 
the expected change in mix in is driven by having the antenna product lines purchased from andrew for a full year and an expected decline in licensing revenue  absent a litigation settlement with agere  lucent  or us robotics 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for apg was in the chronological trend by quarter within the year was    and 
the lower fourth quarter gross profit from the previous quarters is attributed to duplicative manufacturing costs related to the transfer of manufacturing activities from andrew to the pctel factory as well as lower long term margins on the andrew products versus the pctel historical mix 
the transition of manufacturing activities into the pctel factory will continue through the first quarter with an expected gross profit level in the to range in that period 
once the transition is complete  long term gross profit is expected to be in the to range 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for rfsg was in and in the decrease in percentage is attributed to higher cost of goods sold in clarify tm system sales  versus receiver sales  which have much higher software content as a percentage of revenue 
the company expects long term gross profit in this segment to be between and 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for msg was in  in and in the cost of goods sold in the segment relates primarily to third party licenses included in the roaming client product 
the company expects long term gross profit in this segment to be between and 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for licensing was in  in  and in the decrease in was attributable to expensing the net book value of several patents transferred to a third party as part of a license agreement 
the company expects long term gross profit in this segment to be between and 
while there was no modem segment revenue in  the fourth quarter gross profit included a million reversal of a modem royalty expense reserve made possible by the settlement of the company s patent litigation with com

factors that may affect our business  financial condition and future operating results this annual report on form k  including this management s discussion and analysis  contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business  financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results  including those set forth below 
risks related to our business competition within the wireless connectivity products industries is intense and is expected to increase significantly 
our failure to compete successfully could materially harm our prospects and financial results 
the wireless products connectivity markets are intensely competitive 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors 
we expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors enhance their product offerings  new suppliers enter the wireless connectivity products markets  new communication technologies are introduced and additional networks are deployed 
our client software competes with software developed internally by network interface card nic vendors  service providers for networks  and with software developed by large systems integrators 
increased competition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results through pricing pressures  the loss of market share and other factors 
many of our present and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and distribution of their products 
these competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the connectivity products markets  obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products  or otherwise gain a competitive advantage 
we can offer no assurance that we will succeed in developing products or technologies that are more effective than those developed by our competitors 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing and new competitors as the connectivity wireless markets evolve and the level of competition increases 
our ability to grow our business may be threatened if the demand for wireless data services does not continue to grow 
our ability to compete successfully in the wireless market is dependent on the continued trend toward wireless telecommunications and data communications services 
if the rate of growth slows and service providers reduce their capital investments in wireless infrastructure or fail to expand into new geographic markets  our revenue may decline 
wireless data solutions are relatively unproven in the marketplace and some of the wireless technologies have only been commercially introduced in the last few years 
we began offering wireless products in the second quarter of fiscal if wireless data access technology turns out to be unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment  we may not be able to generate enough sales to achieve and grow our business 
we have listed below some of the factors that we believe are key to the success or failure of wireless access technology reliability and security of wireless access technology and the perception by end users of its reliability and security  capacity to handle growing demands for faster transmission of increasing amounts of data  voice and video  the availability of sufficient frequencies for network service providers to deploy products at commercially reasonable rates  cost effectiveness and performance compared to wire line or other high speed access solutions  whose prices and performance continue to improve  suitability for a sufficient number of geographic regions  and availability of sufficient site locations for wireless access 
the factors listed above influence our customers purchase decisions when selecting wireless versus other high speed data access technology 
future legislation  legal decisions and regulation relating to the wireless telecommunications industry may slow or delay the deployment of wireless networks 
wireless access solutions compete with other high speed access solutions such as digital subscriber lines  cable modem technology  fiber optic cable and other high speed wire line and satellite technologies 
if the market for our wireless solutions fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect due to this competition  our sales opportunities will be harmed 
many of these alternative technologies can take advantage of existing installed infrastructure and are generally perceived to be reliable and secure 
as a result  they have already achieved significantly greater market acceptance and penetration than wireless data access technologies 
moreover  current wireless data access technologies have inherent technical limitations that may inhibit their widespread adoption in many areas 
we expect wireless data access technologies to face increasing competitive pressures from both current and future alternative technologies 
in light of these factors  many service providers may be reluctant to invest heavily in wireless data access solutions  including wi fi 
if service providers do not continue to establish wi fi hot spots  we may not be able to generate sales for our wi fi products and our revenue may decline 
our wireless business is dependent upon the continued growth of evolving telecommunications and internet industries 
our future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the data communications and wireless industries  particularly with regard to internet usage 
the global data communications and internet industries are relatively new and evolving rapidly and it is difficult to predict potential growth rates or future trends in technology development for this industry 
the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that have resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services may not continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies 
in addition  the growth in demand for wireless and internet services  and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced data communications products and wireless systems  may not continue at its current rate or at all 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products for the wireless market  which meet the needs of customers 
our revenue depends on our ability to anticipate our existing and prospective customers needs and develop products that address those needs 
our future success will depend on our ability to introduce new products for the wireless market  anticipate improvements and enhancements in wireless technology and wireless standards  and to develop products that are competitive in the rapidly changing wireless industry 
introduction of new products and product enhancements will require coordination of our efforts with those of our customers  suppliers  and manufacturers to rapidly achieve volume production 
if we fail to coordinate these efforts  develop product enhancements or introduce new products that meet the needs of our customers as scheduled  our operating results will be materially and adversely affected and our business and prospects will be harmed 
we cannot assure you that product introductions will meet the anticipated release schedules or that our wireless products will be competitive in the market 
furthermore  given the emerging nature of the wireless market  there can be no assurance our products and technology will not be rendered obsolete by alternative or competing technologies 
we may experience integration or other problems with potential acquisitions  which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
new acquisitions could dilute the interests of existing stockholders  and the announcement of new acquisitions could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
we may in the future make acquisitions of  or large investments in  businesses that offer products  services  and technologies that we believe would complement our products or services  including wireless products and technology 
we may also make acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels 
even if we were to announce an acquisition  we may not be able to complete it 
additionally  any future acquisition or substantial investment would present numerous risks  including difficulty in integrating the technology  operations  internal accounting controls or work force of the acquired business with our existing business  disruption of our on going business  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel  and impairment of assets related to resulting goodwill  and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets 
we expect that future acquisitions could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and our common stock 
if consideration for a transaction is paid in common stock  this would further dilute our existing stockholders 
we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our recent acquisitions of maxrad  inc 
and certain assets of andrew corporation 
we acquired maxrad  inc in january and certain assets of andrew corporation in october as part of our continuing efforts to expand our wireless line and product offerings 
we may experience difficulties in achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 
the business and assets acquired in these acquisitions are the core of our apg segment 
apg s business is the design and assembly of antenna products and accessories used in wireless systems 
these acquisitions represent a significant expansion of and new direction for our wireless connectivity business 
potential risks with these acquisitions include the loss or decrease in orders of one or more of the major customers  decrease in demand for wireless devices that use these products  problems related to the operation of assembly facilities in china  difficulties in assimilation of related personnel  operations  technologies or products  and challenges in integrating internal accounting and financial controls for financial reporting purposes 
our gross margins may vary based on the mix of sales of our products and licenses of our intellectual property  and these variations may cause our net income to decline 
we derive a portion of our sales from our software based connectivity products 
we expect gross margins on newly introduced products generally to be higher than our existing products 
however  due in part to the competitive pricing pressures that affect our products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs  we expect gross margins from both existing and future products to decrease over time 
in addition  licensing revenues from our intellectual property historically have provided higher margins than our product sales 
changes in the mix of products sold and the percentage of our sales in any quarter attributable to products as compared to licensing revenues could cause our quarterly results to vary and could result in a decrease in gross margins and net income 
any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in customers canceling purchases of our products 
sales cycles for our products with major customers are lengthy  often lasting nine months or longer 
in addition  it can take an additional nine months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons  including our original equipment manufacturer customers and carriers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products  over which we have no control  before placing a purchase order  the commercial introduction of our products by an original equipment manufacturer and carriers is typically limited during the initial release to evaluate product performance  and the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayed 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders 
the lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult 
in addition  the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases 
if customer cancellations or product changes were to occur  this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses 
our revenues may fluctuate each quarter due to both domestic and international seasonal trends 
the connectivity products market is too new for us to be able to predict seasonal revenue patterns 
such patterns are also true for wireless test and measurements products  such as those produced by our rf solutions group  where capital spending is involved 
we are currently expanding our sales in international markets  particularly in europe and asia 
to the extent that our revenues in europe and asia or other parts of the world increase in future periods  we expect our period to period revenues to reflect seasonal buying patterns in these markets 
we rely on independent companies to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
if these companies do not meet their commitments to us  our ability to sell products to our customers would be impaired 
we have limited manufacturing capability 
for some product lines we outsource the manufacturing  assembly  and testing of printed circuit board subsystems 
for other product lines  we purchase completed hardware platforms and add our proprietary software 
while there is no unique capability with these suppliers  any failure by these suppliers to meet delivery commitments would cause us to delay shipments and potentially be unable to accept new orders for product 
in addition  in the event that these suppliers discontinued the manufacture of materials used in our products  we would be forced to incur the time and expense of finding a new supplier or to modify our products in such a way that such materials were not necessary 
either of these alternatives could result in increased manufacturing costs and increased prices of our products 
we assemble our apg products in our apg facilities located in illinois and china 
we may experience delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems at our assembly facilities  which could result in lower yields or delays of product shipments to our customers 
in addition  we are having an increasing number of our apg products manufactured in china via contract manufacturers 
any disruption of our own or contract manufacturers operations could cause us to delay product shipments  which would negatively impact our sales  competitive reputation and position 
in addition  if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products  we will have excess or insufficient parts to build our product  either of which could seriously affect our operating results 
in order for us to operate at a profitable level and continue to introduce and develop new products for emerging markets  we must attract and retain our executive officers and qualified technical  sales  support and other administrative personnel 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive officers and certain key engineering  sales  marketing  financial  technical and customer support personnel 
if we lose the services of our executives or key employees  replacements could be difficult to recruit and  as a result  we may not be able to grow our business 
competition for personnel  especially qualified engineering personnel  is intense 
we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  background and industry experience 
as of december   we employed a total of people in our engineering department 
if we lose the services of one or more of our key engineering personnel  our ability to continue to develop products and technologies responsive to our markets may be impaired 
failure to manage our technological and product growth could strain our management  financial and administrative resources 
our ability to successfully sell our products and implement our business plan in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective management planning process 
future product expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on our management by significantly increasing the scope of their responsibilities and by increasing the demands on their management abilities 
to effectively manage our growth in these new technologies  we must enhance our marketing  sales  research and development areas 
we may be subject to litigation regarding intellectual property associated with our wireless business and this could be costly to defend and could prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving intellectual property rights 
we have from time to time in the past received correspondence from third parties alleging that we infringe the third party s intellectual property rights 
we expect potential claims to increase in the future  including with respect to our wireless business 
intellectual property claims against us  and any resulting lawsuit  may result in our incurring significant expenses and could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate what we currently believe are our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their merits or success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention 
this could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operation  financial condition and prospects 
any potential intellectual property litigation against us related to our wireless business could also force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using technology  products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property  obtain from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or redesign those products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual property  which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses 
if we are subject to a successful claim of infringement related to our wireless intellectual property and we fail to develop non infringing intellectual property or license the infringed intellectual property on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  operating results could decline and our ability to grow and sustain our wireless business could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operation and prospects could be impaired 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors 
these claims could also result in significant expense and the diversion of technical and management personnel s attention 
undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in a loss of customers or a delay in market acceptance of our products 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
to date  we have not been made aware of any significant software errors or failures in our products 
however  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance 
our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge us and the tax challenges result in unfavorable outcomes 
we currently have international subsidiaries located in japan  china and israel as well as international branch offices located in hong kong and taiwan 
our branch office in taiwan is presently in the liquidation process 
the complexities resulting from operating in several different tax jurisdictions increases our exposure to worldwide tax challenges 
risks related to our industry if the wireless market does not grow as we anticipate  or if our wireless products are not accepted in these markets  our revenues may be adversely affected 
our future success depends on market demand and growth patterns for products using wireless technology 
our wireless products may not be successful as a result of the intense competition in the wireless market 
if these new wireless products are not accepted in the markets as they are introduced  our revenues and profitability will be negatively affected 
our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies 
if we are not successful in response to rapidly changing technologies  our products may become obsolete and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the wireless data access business is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  short product life cycles and frequent new product introductions 
to remain competitive  we have successfully introduced several new products 
both the cellular g and g and wi fi spaces are rapidly changing and prone to standardization 
we will continue to evaluate  develop and introduce technologically advanced products that will position us for possible growth in the wireless data access market 
if we are not successful in response to rapidly changing technologies  our products may became obsolete and we may not be able to compete effectively 
changes in laws or regulations  in particular  future fcc regulations affecting the broadband market  internet service providers  or the communications industry  could negatively affect our ability to develop new technologies or sell new products and therefore  reduce our profitability 
the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission  or fcc  extends to the entire communications industry  including our customers and their products and services that incorporate our products 
future fcc regulations affecting the broadband access services industry  our customers or our products may harm our business 
for example  future fcc regulatory policies that affect the availability of data and internet services may impede our customers penetration into their markets or affect the prices that they are able to charge 
in addition  fcc regulatory policies that affect the specifications of wireless data devices may impede certain of our customers ability to manufacture their products profitably  which could  in turn  reduce demand for our products 
furthermore  international regulatory bodies are beginning to adopt standards for the communications industry 
although our business has not been hurt by any regulations to date  in the future  delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements may result in order cancellations or postponements of product purchases by our customers  which would reduce our profitability 
risks related to our licensing program our ability to sustain or grow our revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property is subject to many risks  and any inability to successfully license our intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may not be able to sustain our revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property 
in addition to our wireless product lines  we offer our intellectual property through licensing and product royalty arrangements 
we have over us patents granted or pending addressing both essential international telecommunications union and non essential technologies 
in connection with our intellectual property licensing efforts  we have filed several patent infringement lawsuits and are aggressively pursuing unlicensed companies to license their unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
we have pending patent infringement litigation claims with us robotics  agere and lucent 
we expect litigation to continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
because of the high degree of complexity of the intellectual property at issue  the inherent uncertainties of litigation in general and the preliminary nature of these litigation matters  we cannot assure you that we will ultimately prevail or receive the judgments that we seek 
we may not be able to obtain licensing agreements from these companies on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages as a result of claims these companies have brought against us which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
litigation efforts related to our licensing program are expected to be costly and may not achieve our objectives 
litigation such as our suits with us robotics  agere and lucent can take years to resolve and can be expensive to pursue or defend 
we currently expect our intellectual property litigation costs to be within a range of to million in  in the absence of any settlement 
in addition  the allegations and claims involved in these lawsuits  even if ultimately resolved in our favor  could be time consuming to litigate and divert management attention 
we may not ultimately prevail in these matters or receive the judgments that we seek 
we could also face substantial monetary damages as a result of claims others bring against us 
in addition  courts decisions on current pending and future motions could have the effect of determining the ultimate outcome of the litigation prior to a trial on the merits  or strengthen or weaken our ability to assert claims and defenses in the future 
accordingly  an adverse judgment could seriously harm our business  financial position and operating results and cause our stock price to decline substantially 
we expect to continue to be subject to litigation regarding intellectual property claims related to our licensing program which could impair our ability to grow or sustain revenues from our licensing efforts 
as we continue to aggressively pursue licensing arrangements with companies that are using our intellectual property without our authorization  we expect to continue to be subject to lawsuits that challenge the validity of our intellectual property or that allege that we have infringed third party intellectual property rights 
any of these claims could results in substantial damages against us and could impair our ability to grow and sustain our licensing business 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
as a result  at least in part  of our licensing efforts to date  we are currently subject to claims from agere and lucent regarding patent infringement matters of the nature described above 
we have also been subject to claims from others in the past regarding similar matters 
in addition  in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving intellectual property rights 
we expect these claims to increase as our intellectual property portfolio becomes larger 
intellectual property claims against us  and any resulting lawsuit  may result in our incurring significant expenses and could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate what we currently believe are our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their merits or success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention 
our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited  and any limitation could adversely affect our ability to sustain or increase revenue from our licensing program 
our ability to sustain and grow revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property is dependent on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our ability to enforce these rights is subject to many challenges and may be limited 
for example  one or more of our pending patents may never be issued 
in addition  our patents  both issued and pending  may not prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
us robotics  agere and lucent have currently pending claims seeking to invalidate one or more of our patents 
if a court were to invalidate one or more of our patents  this could materially and adversely affect our licensing program 
furthermore  some foreign laws  including those of various countries in asia  do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as united states laws 
risks related to our common stock the trading price of our stock price may be volatile based on a number of factors  some of which are not in our control 
the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile 
the common stock price has fluctuated from a low of to a high of during our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  many of which are out of our control  including announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  outcome of ongoing intellectual property related litigations  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in our industry  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  mergers and acquisitions  and sales of common stock by our stockholders or us 
in addition  the nasdaq national market  where many publicly held telecommunications companies  including pctel  are traded  often experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of an individual company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted against that company 
this type of litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
provisions in our charter documents may inhibit a change of control or a change of management  which may cause the market price for our common stock to fall and may inhibit a takeover or change in our control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
provisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor 
these provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares  and as a result  these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts and may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor 
our charter documents do not permit stockholders to act by written consent  do not permit stockholders to call a stockholders meeting  and provide for a classified board of directors  which means stockholders can only elect  or remove  a limited number of our directors in any given year 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
the board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of this preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be affected by  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
further  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may drop 
under new regulations required by the sarbanes oxley act of  if we are unable to successfully implement processes and procedures to achieve and maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting  our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports could be harmed 
we must comply with the rules promulgated under section of the sarbanes oxley act of section requires an annual management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  a report by our independent registered public accountants addressing this assessment  and a report by our independent auditors addressing the effectiveness of our internal control 
in connection with reporting our financial results for the quarter and year ended december   we have identified and described a material weakness as defined by the relevant accounting standards in our internal control related to our accounting for income taxes in the fourth quarter of specifically  the company did not have effective controls over determining net operating loss carrybacks  applicable state tax rates applied  and the tax effect of stock option exercises 
in addition  the company did not have effective controls to monitor the difference between the income tax basis and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and reconcile the difference to deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
this control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the fourth quarter financial statements 
to address the material weakness described above  pctel has engaged an outside tax consultant and has implemented an internal training program to enhance the capabilities of its internal tax personnel 
nevertheless  we cannot be certain in future periods that other control deficiencies that may constitute one or more significant deficiencies as defined by the relevant accounting standards or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  will not be identified 
the occurrence of control deficiencies in our internal control  and material weaknesses in particular  adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis 
in addition  our independent auditors and we are still completing evaluation  assessment and testing activities related to our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the requirements of section as a result  we have not included our annual management report on internal control over financial reporting as of december  with the filing of this annual report on form k  nor have we filed the related attestation report of our independent auditors or the report of our independent auditors on the effectiveness of our internal control 
these reports will be filed in an amendment to this annual report within the time period permitted under the sec s rules and regulations 
due to the material weakness already identified  we expect that the report of our independent auditors on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting will be adverse 
in addition  we cannot be certain that other control deficiencies  including material weaknesses  in our internal control will not be identified as we and our independent auditors conclude the required section evaluation  assessment and testing activities 
while we are expending significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by section  we cannot be certain that the actions we are taking to improve  achieve and maintain our internal control over financial reporting will be adequate or that we will be able to implement our planned processes and procedures 
if we do not complete our compliance activities under section in a timely manner  or the processes and procedures that we implement for our internal control over financial reporting are inadequate  our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports  and consequently our business and operating results  could be harmed 
this in turn could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial reports  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to credit risks and interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative investment portfolio  which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we have investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted based on the duration of such investments if interest rates rise  while floating rate securities and the reinvestment of funds from matured fixed rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  which can include both government and corporate obligations with ratings of a or better  and money market funds 
we have accumulated a and  unrealized holding gain as of december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical increase or decrease of in market interest rates would not result in a material decrease in interest income earned through maturity on investments held at december  we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are exposed to currency fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales by denominating substantially all transactions in us dollars 
if the united states dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by relative to the currencies in which are sales were denominated  our net loss would not have changed by a material amount for the year ended december  for purposes of this calculation  we have assumed that the exchange rates would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  however  arises in part from translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuation gains for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively
