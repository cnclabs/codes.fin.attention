item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of northwest natural gas company s financial condition including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to the consolidated activities of the company for the three years ended dec 
 unless otherwise indicated  references in this discussion to notes are to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
the consolidated financial statements include the regulated parent company  northwest natural gas company nw natural  and its non regulated wholly owned subsidiaries nng financial corporation financial corporation  and its wholly owned subsidiaries northwest energy corporation northwest energy  and its wholly owned subsidiary together these businesses are referred to herein as the company 
in this report  the term utility is used to describe the company s regulated gas distribution business and the term non utility is used to describe its interstate gas storage business and other non regulated activities see note in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total  certain measures are expressed in cents per share 
these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings 
the company believes this per share information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on earnings 
all references in this report to earnings per share are on the basis of diluted shares see note 
executive summary the company s strategy in was to strengthen its financial position and remain focused on profitably growing its regulated gas distribution business and interstate gas storage business 
highlights of include overall earnings growth of percent over despite weather conditions that were percent warmer  the addition of  customers  for a growth rate in excess of percent for the th consecutive year  the issuance of million in common stock through a public offering to help fund major construction projects and maintain a balanced capital structure  the upgrade of the company s long term debt rating to a by the standard poor s rating services  the completion ahead of schedule of the company s largest construction project to date  the mile south mist pipeline extension smpe  which received timely regulatory approval for recovering its costs through customer rates in both oregon and washington  regulatory approval to track future pipeline integrity management costs into rates in oregon  
table of contents a new year labor agreement  also known as the joint accord  the settlement and early implementation of the washington general rate case  expansion of the company s gas distribution system into coos county  oregon  an area targeted for natural gas service for over three decades  and the development of additional gas storage capacity at mist for interstate storage services  replacing capacity that had been recalled to meet core utility customer requirements 
issues  challenges and performance measures there are a number of factors that affect the company s operations and financial performance 
the most significant issues and challenges the company expects to face in include high gas commodity prices  unpredictable weather conditions  the impact of regulatory actions or policy changes  managing gas supplies and storage capacity  maintaining a competitive advantage over alternate fuels  managing environmental risks and exposures  an uncertain economic recovery and higher interest rates 
for a detailed listing of other risks facing the company  see forward looking statements and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below 
in order to deal with these and other issues affecting the business  the company s strategic plan includes strategies for improving nw natural s ability to add customers both profitably and at a rapid pace  maintaining nw natural s reputation for exemplary service  reducing business risk  managing all costs  including capital expenditures  setting high performance standards for all employees  and judiciously growing beyond the company s local distribution business where such growth would complement core assets and competencies 
in addition to return on equity roe and common equity ratio as key indicators of the company s operating performance and financial condition  other key performance measures the company uses in monitoring progress against its goals are utility earnings per share  customer satisfaction ratings  new customer additions  operations and maintenance expense per customer  construction cost per meter installed  and non revenue producing capital expenditures per customer

application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the company s financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in the financial 
table of contents statements 
management considers its critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments  including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if the company reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company s most critical estimates or judgments involve regulatory cost recovery  unbilled revenues  derivative instruments  pension assumptions  income taxes and environmental contingencies 
management has discussed the estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board 
the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
within the context of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates  management is not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
regulatory accounting nw natural is regulated by the public utility commission of oregon opuc and the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc  which establish the company s utility rates and rules governing utility services provided to customers  and to a certain extent set forth the accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions 
in general  nw natural uses the same accounting principles as other non regulated companies reporting under gaap 
however  certain accounting principles  primarily statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  require different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of regulation 
for example  nw natural accounts for the cost of gas using a deferral and cost recovery mechanism called the purchased gas adjustment pga  which is submitted for approval annually to the opuc and wutc see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
there are other expenses or revenues that the opuc or wutc may require the company to defer for recovery or refund in future periods 
sfas no 
requires the company to account for these types of deferred expenses or deferred revenues as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet 
when nw natural is allowed to recover these expenses from or refund them to customers  it recognizes the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time it realizes the adjustment to amounts included in utility rates and charged to customers 
the conditions a company must satisfy to adopt the accounting policies and practices of sfas no 
applicable to regulated companies include an independent regulator sets rates  the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
nw natural continues to apply sfas no 
in accounting for its regulated utility operations 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the company discontinuing the application of sfas no 
for some or all of its regulated business 
this would require the write off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers 
based on current regulatory and competitive conditions  nw natural believes that it is reasonable to expect continued application of sfas no 
for its regulated activities  and that all of its regulatory assets and liabilities at dec 
 and are recoverable or refundable through future customer rates 

table of contents revenue recognition utility revenues  derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas  are recognized when the gas is delivered to and received by the customer 
revenues are accrued for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed based on estimates of gas deliveries from the last meter reading date to month end unbilled revenues 
unbilled revenues are primarily based on the company s percentage estimate of its unbilled gas each month  which is dependent upon a number of factors that require management s judgment 
these factors include total gas receipts and deliveries  customer meter reading dates  customer usage patterns and weather 
unbilled revenue estimates are reversed the following month when actual billings occur 
estimated unbilled revenues at dec 
 and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in unbilled revenues at year end was primarily due to higher gas prices included in customer rates  partially offset by lower unbilled volumes reflecting warmer weather and decreases in customer usage due to higher prices 
if the estimated percentage of unbilled gas at dec 
 were adjusted up or down by percent  then the company s unbilled revenues  net operating revenues and net income would have increased or decreased by an estimated million  million and million  respectively 
in november  nw natural implemented a weather normalization mechanism in oregon that helps stabilize net operating revenues by adjusting current customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
weather normalization is also included in unbilled revenues at the end of each accounting period using management s judgments as discussed above 
non utility revenues  derived primarily from interstate storage services  are recognized upon delivery of the service to customers 
revenues from optimization of excess storage and transportation capacity are recognized over the life of the contract for guaranteed amounts under the contract  or are recognized as they are earned for amounts above the guaranteed value based on estimates provided by the independent energy marketing company 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in providing gas distribution services  nw natural enters into forward contracts to buy and sell natural gas 
these contracts qualify as normal purchases and normal sales under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  because they provide for a purchase or sale  and subsequent delivery  of natural gas in quantities that are probable of delivery over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business see note  derivatives policy 
accordingly  these contracts are accounted for at the time of settlement and are not reflected on the company s balance sheet or income statement prior to settlement 
the company has an established derivatives policy that sets forth the guidelines for using selected financial derivative products to support prudent risk management strategies within designated parameters see note 
the policy specifically prohibits the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
hedging activities consist of natural gas commodity price and foreign currency exchange rate hedges which are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
these contracts that qualify as derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
generally  most of these contracts are subject to regulatory deferral mechanisms  and as such any change in the fair value of these contracts is recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to sfas no 
see note  derivatives policy 
the company s estimate of fair value is determined from period to period based on prices available from external sources and internal modeling based on index prices that are subject to market volatility 
for estimated fair values at dec 
 and  see note 
table of contents the following table summarizes the realized gains and losses from commodity price and currency hedge transactions in the years ended dec 
  and thousands gains losses on commodity price swap contracts gains losses on commodity price option contracts subtotal gains losses on swaps related to interstate gas storage gains on foreign currency contracts total gains losses realized gains losses from commodity price and foreign currency hedge contracts are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and are included in the calculation of annual pga rate changes 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark to market valuations are not recognized in current income or other comprehensive income  but are recorded as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets  which are offset by a corresponding balance in non trading derivative assets or liabilities see note 
accounting for pensions the company has two qualified  non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering all regular employees with more than one year of service 
these plans are funded through a trust dedicated to providing retiree pension benefits 
the company also has several non qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees 
these non qualified plans are unfunded 
net periodic pension cost nppc and accumulated benefit obligations abo are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  using a number of key assumptions including the discount rate  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and the expected long term return on plan assets see financial condition pension cost income and funding status  below  and note 
these key assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
nppc consists of service costs  interest costs  the amortization of actuarial gains and losses  expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the market related valuation reflects differences between expected returns and actual investment returns  which are recognized over a three year period from the year in which they occur  thereby reducing year to year nppc volatility 
a number of factors are considered in developing pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
for the dec 
 measurement date  the company decreased the discount rate assumption from percent to percent  maintained the rate of compensation increase in a range of percent  and maintained the expected long term return on plan assets at percent 
the change in discount rate was the primary factor contributing to the increase in the plans abo from million at dec 
 to million at dec 
 
table of contents the company believes its pension assumptions to be appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions 
however  the following reflects the sensitivity of nppc and abo to changes in certain actuarial assumptions thousands change in assumption impact on nppc impact on abo at dec 
 discount rate expected long term return on plan assets n a the impact of a change in nppc on operating results would be less than the amounts shown above because about percent of nppc is charged to operations and maintenance expense 
the remaining percent is capitalized as construction overhead and included in utility plant  which is amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset placed into service 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by recognizing deferred income taxes for all temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities at current income tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires the recognition of additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators flow through deferred income tax benefits or expenses in the ratemaking process of the regulated utility regulatory tax assets and liabilities 
this is consistent with ratemaking policies of the opuc and wutc 
regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent the company believes they will be recoverable from or refunded to customers in future rates 
at dec 
 and  the company had regulatory assets representing differences between book and tax basis related to pre property of million and million  respectively  and has recorded an offsetting deferred tax liability for the same amounts see note 
nw natural believes that it is reasonable to expect recovery of these regulatory assets through future customer rates 
however  future regulatory changes could require the write off of all or a portion of these regulatory assets should they no longer be probable of recovery in future rates 
contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimating probable losses requires an analysis of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties 
in the normal course of business  accruals are recorded for loss contingencies based on an analysis of potential results  developed in consultation with outside counsel when appropriate  including allowances for uncollectible accounts  environmental claims and property damage and personal injury claims 
where information is sufficient to estimate only a range of probable liability  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  the company recognizes an accrued liability at the lower end of the range 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or estimates regarding these contingencies 
with respect to environmental claims and related litigation costs  receivables are recorded for anticipated recoveries under insurance contracts based on amounts the company estimates are probable of recovery 
if these amounts are not recovered from insurance  the company believes that recovery is probable from future utility rates based on current approval by the opuc to defer these costs as a regulatory asset 
see note 
table of contents results of operations regulatory matters nw natural provides gas utility service in oregon and washington  with oregon representing over percent of its revenues 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the pace of continued growth in the residential and commercial markets and by nw natural s ability to remain price competitive in the large industrial market  to control expenses  and to obtain reasonable and timely regulatory ratemaking treatment for its operating and maintenance costs and investments made in utility plant 
general rate cases nw natural s most recent general rate increase in oregon  which was effective sept 
  authorized rates designed to produce a return on shareholders equity roe of percent 
the opuc approved a revenue increase of million per year  of which million went into effect on sept 
  and million went into effect on a deferred basis on nov 
 as the first miles of the company s southern portion of smpe went into service 
the remaining million for the southern portion of the smpe went into effect on oct 
  upon the completion and placement into service of the last segment of the smpe project 
recovery for the company s coos county distribution system project of million went into effect on nov 
  on a deferred basis 
while not included in the rate case result  an additional annual rate recovery of million associated with the northern portion of smpe became effective oct 
 in november  nw natural filed a general rate case in washington that proposed a revenue increase of million per year from washington operations through rate increases averaging percent 
in june  the wutc approved a settlement agreement entered into by the parties to nw natural s washington general rate case  which became effective on july   authorizing a revenue increase of million per year  or percent 
in addition  the settlement authorized nw natural to include the smpe cost of service of approximately million per year in rates  subject to audit  concurrent with the annual washington pga filing which became effective on nov 
 see rate mechanisms  below 
notwithstanding authorized revenue levels approved by the opuc or the wutc  actual revenues are dependent on weather  economic conditions  customer growth  competition and other factors affecting gas usage in nw natural s service area 
in january  the company filed a rate case with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc proposing an update of maximum rates for the company s interstate storage services operation and new service offerings 
the requested new rates are designed to reflect the costs related to the further development of the mist gas storage facilities and costs associated with the smpe project 
this filing was made to satisfy ferc s requirement that there be a cost and revenue review in three years following its original storage service rate authorization 
rate mechanisms weather normalization 
in november  nw natural implemented a weather normalization mechanism in oregon that helps stabilize net operating revenues  or margin  by adjusting current customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather 
the weather normalization mechanism approved by the opuc is applied to oregon residential and commercial 
table of contents customers bills between nov 
and may of each heating season 
the mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers rates to reflect normal weather using the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
the mechanism is intended to stabilize fixed costs and to reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than average weather 
in october  the mechanism was modified to limit the upward or downward adjustments to individual bills to certain specified ranges  with any excess amounts being deferred see residential and commercial sales  below 
purchased gas adjustment 
rate changes are applied each year under the pga mechanisms in nw natural s tariffs in oregon and washington to reflect changes in the costs of natural gas commodity purchased under contracts with gas producers see comparison of gas operations cost of gas sold  below  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in regulatory asset or liability accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective the previous year 
pursuant to the pga tariffs  in september  the opuc approved rate increases effective oct 
 averaging percent for oregon residential sales customers  and in october  the wutc approved rate increases effective nov 
 averaging percent for washington residential sales customers 
these rate increases include deferred revenue from the costs related to the smpe project  which was completed and placed into service on sept 
 the oregon increase of percent consisted of recovery of gas costs percent  temporary rate adjustments percent  including deferrals for smpe and the recovery of smpe costs of service percent 
the washington increase of percent consisted of the recovery of gas costs percent  temporary rate adjustments percent  and the recovery of smpe costs percent 
the inclusion of smpe costs in oregon and washington rates resulted in additional revenue increases totaling million per year 
during the fourth quarter of  the staff of the opuc initiated a review of gas purchasing strategies for all three local gas distribution companies serving oregon 
the schedule  scope and potential findings  including the matter of whether the review will lead to formal proceedings before the opuc  remain uncertain 
in  the opuc approved a pga rate increase averaging percent for oregon sales customers and the wutc approved a pga rate increase averaging percent for washington sales customers  both effective on oct 
 in  the opuc approved pga rate decreases averaging percent for oregon sales customers and the wutc approved pga rate decreases averaging percent for washington sales customers  both effective on oct 
 the opuc has formalized a process that tests for excessive earnings in connection with gas utilities annual filings under their pga mechanisms 
the opuc has confirmed nw natural s ability to pass through percent of its prudently incurred gas costs into rates 
under this requirement  nw natural is authorized to retain all of its earnings up to a threshold level equal to its authorized roe plus basis points 
one third of any earnings above that level will be refunded to customers 
the excess earnings threshold is subject to adjustment up or down each year depending on movements in interest rates 
no amounts were identified in this process for refund to customers with respect to or earnings results 
nw natural does not expect that amounts will be identified for refund with respect to its earnings in  which will be reviewed by the opuc in the second quarter of conservation tariff 
effective oct 
  the opuc authorized nw natural to implement a conservation tariff  a mechanism designed to recover lost margin due to changes in residential and commercial customers consumption patterns 
the tariff is a partial decoupling mechanism that breaks the link between the company s earnings and the quantity of energy consumed by its customers  so the company does not have an incentive to discourage customers conservation efforts 

table of contents the conservation tariff includes two components 
the first  a price elasticity factor  adjusts for increases or decreases in consumption attributable to annual changes in commodity costs or periodic changes in the company s general rates 
the second is a conservation adjustment calculated on a monthly basis to account for deviations between actual and expected volumes 
additional revenues or credits to customers produced by the conservation adjustment are booked to a deferral account that is reconciled as part of the company s annual pga 
baseline consumption is based on customer consumption patterns as determined in the oregon general rate case  adjusted for consumption resulting from new customers 
the partial decoupling mechanism will expire at the end of september unless the opuc approves an extension based on the results of an independent study to measure the mechanism s effectiveness 
work on the independent review  which involves interested parties  is in process and is expected to be completed by the end of march the study is expected to provide the basis for the company s filing to renew the tariff 
pipeline integrity cost recovery 
in july  the opuc approved applications by nw natural relating to the accounting treatment and full recovery for the company s cost of its pipeline integrity management program imp as mandated by the pipeline safety improvement act of pipeline safety act and related rules adopted by the us department of transportation s office of pipeline safety see financial condition cash flows investing activities  below 
under the applications as approved  nw natural classifies its imp costs as either capital expenditures or regulatory assets  accumulates the costs over each month period ending june  and recovers the costs  subject to audit  through rate changes effective on october of each year commencing oct 
 the approved accounting and rate treatment for these costs extends through sept 
  and may be reviewed for potential extension after that date 
nw natural will begin including imp costs in rates in open pathway tariff 
the open pathway tariff  approved by the opuc on dec 
  requires developers to provide the company with a trench for installation of mains and services in new developments 
if a trench is not provided  the tariff requires the developer to pay nw natural s costs of trenching 
in the past  provision of a trench or reimbursement was not required 
implementation of the tariff began in early opuc investigation in august  the opuc approved a stipulation among nw natural  the opuc staff and two parties in the oregon general rate case  providing for the settlement of issues raised in an investigation initiated by the opuc in these issues relate to transactions or interests in certain properties involving nw natural in the vicinity of its headquarters building in downtown portland  and the use of some of these properties for employee parking 
the primary effect of the stipulation was to reverse cost recovery as of sept 
  for certain properties that should not have been included in rate base in the oregon general rate case  and for certain employee parking costs 
pursuant to the stipulation  nw natural commenced paying refunds in the amount of million to oregon customers on oct 
  in connection with the annual oregon pga filing effective on that date 
approximately million of that amount was charged to a reserve in and the first quarter of  approximately million was recognized as a reduction in other revenues in the second quarter of  and the balance of million was recognized as a reduction in other revenues in the third quarter of effective oct 
  oregon revenues were reduced by about million per year to eliminate these costs from future rates 
nw natural agreed in the stipulation to undergo an audit in funded by the company  which is expected to focus on ratemaking issues relating to the inclusion 
table of contents of assets in rate base and nw natural s transactions with any affiliated interests 
the opuc staff informed the company that the required audit will be performed during the third quarter of comparison of gas distribution operations the following table summarizes the composition of gas utility volumes and revenues for the three years ended dec

  more than  customers were added to the system  representing an average annual growth rate of percent 
residential and commercial sales the following table summarizes the utility volumes and utility operating revenues in the residential and commercial markets 
the primary factors that impact the results of operations in these markets are seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in the company s service areas 
thousands  except customer data utility volumes therms residential sales commercial sales change in unbilled sales total weather sensitive utility volumes 
table of contents thousands  except customer data utility operating revenues dollars residential sales commercial sales change in unbilled sales total weather sensitive utility revenues total number of residential and commercial customers end of year compared to volumes sold were percent lower  reflecting the effect of percent warmer weather that was partially offset by the impact of percent customer growth  and operating revenues were percent higher  primarily due to higher rates effective oct

compared to volumes sold were percent lower  reflecting the effects of percent warmer weather that was partially offset by the impact of percent customer growth and the price elasticity effect of lower rates effective oct 
  and operating revenues were percent lower in than in excluding the impact of gas cost refunds totaling million during  revenues were million  or percent  lower in than in  primarily due to lower rates effective oct 
 typically  percent or more of annual utility operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
although variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to these customers  the effect on margin and net income was significantly reduced with the implementation of the weather normalization mechanism in oregon beginning in november see regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
this mechanism applies to meter readings of participating oregon customers taken between nov 
and may approximately percent of nw natural s residential and commercial customers are in washington  where the mechanism is not in effect  and about percent of the eligible oregon customers elected not to be covered by the mechanism  so the mechanism does not fully insulate the company from utility earnings volatility due to weather 
the mechanism contributed a net million of margin  equivalent to cents a share of earnings  in the twelve month period ended dec 
  making up a significant portion of the margin that otherwise would have been lost from warmer than average weather 
in  the mechanism contributed million of margin  equivalent to cents a share of earnings  in the two months after becoming effective in november total utility operating revenues include accruals for gas delivered but not yet billed to customers unbilled revenues based on estimates of gas deliveries from that month s meter reading dates to month end 
amounts reported as unbilled revenues reflect the increase or decrease in the balance of accrued unbilled revenues compared to the prior year end 
weather conditions  rate changes and customer billing dates affect the balance of accrued unbilled revenue at the end of each month 
at dec 
  accrued unbilled revenue was million  compared to million at dec

the higher volumes and revenues partially reflect an improving economy  but results primarily reflect a continued shift from transportation to sales volumes and the reclassification of a relatively large number of commercial customers to the industrial customer category over the past months resulting from rate design changes in oregon 
over the past two years  the number of industrial customers increased percent from to  and percent from to industrial rates in oregon were redesigned as part of the general rate case in  transferring million of annual revenue requirement from industrial rates to residential and commercial rates in order to better reflect relative costs of service and to improve the competitiveness of the company s rates in the industrial market 
total volumes delivered to industrial and electric generation customers were million therms  or percent  lower in than in  and utility operating revenues were down million  or percent 
results from the industrial market in reflect weaker economic conditions during the year  and most of the incremental revenue decline was due to a shift from higher margin firm schedules to lower margin interruptible schedules and industrial rate decreases effective in september the decline in volumes and operating revenues from the electric generation market primarily reflect the winding down of a temporary market that emerged in response to the energy crisis 
the volumes and operating revenues in were related to two customers served under contracts that went into effect in the second half of and expired at the end of the second quarter of most of the revenues from these contracts were derived from fixed charges 
a third electric generation customer used million therms in under a contract with low volumetric charges

cost of gas sold natural gas commodity prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years 
the effects of higher gas commodity prices and price volatility on core utility customers are mitigated through the use of underground storage facilities  gas commodity price financial hedge contracts  and short term 
table of contents sales of gas commodity and transportation capacity to on system or off system customers in periods when core utility customers do not require the full firm pipeline capacity and gas supplies 
the company regularly renews or replaces its expiring long term and medium term contracts with new agreements with a variety of existing and new suppliers 
no single contract amounts to more than  therms per day or percent of the company s average daily contract volumes 
firm year round supply contracts have terms ranging from one to ten years 
all of the contracts use price formulas tied to monthly index prices  primarily at the nova inventory transfer trading point in alberta 
nw natural hedges a majority of its contracts each year using financial instruments as part of its gas purchase strategy 
the total cost of gas sold was million in  an increase of million or percent compared to and  was million or percent lower than the cost per therm of gas sold was percent higher in than in and percent lower in than in the cost per therm of gas sold includes current gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains or losses from commodity hedges  margin from off system gas sales  demand cost balancing adjustments demand equalization  regulatory deferrals and company use

excluding this adjustment  cost per therm of gas sold was percent lower in than in  reflecting decreases in gas commodity prices effective in late results for also included adjustments reducing cost of gas relating to amounts of deferred expenses for the recovery of pipeline demand charges under the pga mechanism 
these adjustments contributed cents a share to earnings in  of which cents a share applied to periods prior to the rate methodology represented in the adjustments continues to be applied in the company s accounting for pipeline demand charges 
nw natural s recorded amount of unaccounted for gas was percent of gas sendout in  compared to percent in and percent in unaccounted for gas is the difference between the amount of gas the company receives from all sources  including pipeline deliveries and withdrawals from storage  and the amount of gas it delivers to customers or other delivery points 
unaccounted for gas may be caused in part by physical gas leakage  but it also may be due to cumulative inaccuracies in gas metering  estimates of unbilled gas or other causes 
a normal amount of unaccounted for gas is considered to be percent of total gas sendout during a period  but the amounts may vary within a range around this estimate 
during  the lower estimated amount of unaccounted for gas had the effect of increasing cost of gas and decreasing margin by million as compared to during  the lower estimated amount of unaccounted for gas had the effect of reducing cost of gas and increasing margin by million as compared to the estimated percentages of unaccounted for gas in and were lower than  partially due to improvements in gas measurement and estimating 
nw natural uses a natural gas commodity price hedge program under the terms of its derivatives policy to help manage its variable price gas commodity contracts see application of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  above 
nw natural recorded net hedging gains of million from this program during  compared to net hedging gains of million in and net hedging losses of million in hedging gains and losses relating to gas commodity purchases are included in cost of gas and factored into nw natural s annual pga rate changes  and therefore have no material impact on net income 

table of contents under nw natural s pga tariff in oregon  net income is affected within defined limits by changes in purchased gas costs 
nw natural is allowed to collect an amount for purchased gas costs based on estimates that are included in current utility rates 
if the actual purchased gas costs are higher than the amounts included in rates  nw natural is not allowed to charge its customers currently for those higher gas costs but is allowed to defer the costs and collect them in the future 
similarly  when the actual purchased gas costs are lower than the amount included in rates  the savings are not immediately passed on to customers but are deferred and refunded in future periods 
nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to the projected costs built into rates 
the remaining percent of the higher or lower gas costs is recorded as deferred regulatory assets or liabilities for recovery from or refund to customers in future rates 
in and  nw natural s gas costs were slightly lower than the gas costs embedded in rates  with the effect that nw natural s share of the lower costs increased margin by million and million  equivalent to cent a share and less than cent a share of earnings  respectively

nw natural uses gas supplies and transportation capacity that are not required for core utility residential  commercial and industrial firm customers to make off system sales 
under the pga tariff in oregon  nw natural retains percent of the margins realized from its off system gas sales and records the remaining percent as a deferred regulatory asset or liability for recovery from or refund to customers in future rates 
nw natural s share of margin from off system gas sales in resulted in a loss of million  equivalent to less than cent a share 
nw natural s share of margin from off system gas sales in was million  equivalent to cents a share of earnings 
results for reflected a higher volume of off system gas sales because of warmer weather in the first quarter and higher gas prices 
nw natural was able to use gas supplies that were available under contract for the winter season  but not required for delivery to core utility market customers  to make these off system sales

earnings from this business segment were lower in primarily due to a lower contribution from a contract with an independent energy marketing company that optimizes the value of nw natural s assets by engaging in trading activities using temporarily unused portions of its upstream pipeline transportation capacity and gas storage capacity 
the lower contribution was primarily due to a change in market conditions in which gas price differentials were less volatile in compared to in oregon  nw natural retains percent of the pre tax income from interstate storage services and optimization of storage and pipeline transportation capacity when the costs of such capacity have not been included in core utility rates  and percent of the pre tax income from such optimization when the capacity costs have been included in core utility rates

these contracts are primarily index based and subject to annual re pricing  a process that is intended to reflect anticipated market price trends during the next year 
nw natural s pga mechanism in oregon and washington provides for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs  except that  for oregon customers  nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to the annual pga price built into customer rates 
to the degree that market risks exist due to potential adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign exchange rates or counterparty credit quality in relation to these financial and physical contracts  the company considers the risks to be commodity price risk the prices of natural gas commodity are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
commodity price swap and call option contracts financial hedge contracts are used to convert certain natural gas supply contracts from floating prices to fixed prices 
these financial hedge contracts are included in the company s annual pga filing  subject to a prudency review 
at dec 
 and  notional amounts under these commodity swap and call option contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
at dec 
  five of these financial hedge contracts extended beyond dec 
 if all of the commodity price swap and call option contracts had been settled on dec 
  a regulatory gain of million would have been realized see note 

table of contents foreign currency risk the costs of natural gas commodity and certain pipeline services purchased from canadian suppliers are subject to changes in the value of the canadian currency in relation to the us currency 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates with respect to the purchases of natural gas from canadian suppliers 
at dec 
 and  notional amounts under foreign currency forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
as of dec 
  no foreign currency forward contracts extended beyond dec 
 if all of the foreign currency forward contracts had been settled on dec 
  a gain of million would have been realized see note 
counterparty credit risk certain suppliers that sell gas to nw natural have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
to manage this supply risk  the company purchases gas from a number of different suppliers  with no single supplier accounting for more than percent of the company s total purchases for a given monthly period 
the company also evaluates suppliers creditworthiness and maintains the ability to require additional financial assurances  including deposits  letters of credit  or surety bonds in case a supplier defaults 
in the event of a supplier s failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas  the regulated utility would need to replace those volumes at prevailing market prices  which may be higher or lower than the original transaction prices 
these costs would be subject to the pga sharing mechanism discussed above 
since most of the company s commodity supply contracts are priced at the monthly market index price  and the company has significant storage flexibility  it is unlikely that a supplier default would have a materially adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
with respect to the financial counterparties the company uses for entering into commodity price hedge contracts  nw natural s derivatives policy requires each counterparty to be at least two rating grades above non investment grade 
because counterparty ratings are subject to change at any time  the company could have contracts outstanding with counterparties whose ratings are non investment grade 
nw natural s counterparty credit exposure as of dec 
 was as follows thousands credit exposure investment grade counterparties non investment grade counterparties total due to the volatility of natural gas commodity prices  the market value and credit exposure of certain derivative contracts could exceed the company s credit limits established in its derivatives policy 
if such credit limits were exceeded  the company would have the ability to require collateral from the counterparty and would not enter into any further contracts with that counterparty until it was within the limits 
if a counterparty failed to perform under its contract  nw natural could sustain a loss which would be included in the annual pga adjustment  subject to a regulatory prudency review 
under certain circumstances  a counterparty default could result in a material loss 
however  based on the company s current regulatory mechanism  the absence of any significant position with a single counterparty and the strength of the counterparties current credit ratings  any such loss is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition 

table of contents weather risk the company is exposed to weather risk primarily from its regulated utility business 
a large portion of the company s net operating revenues margin is volume driven  and current rates are based on an assumption of normal weather 
in  the opuc approved a weather normalization mechanism for residential and commercial customers 
this mechanism affects customer bills between nov 
through may of each winter heating season  increasing or decreasing the margin component of customers rates to reflect normal weather using the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
the mechanism is intended to stabilize the recovery of the utility s fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than average weather 
customers in oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism 
as of dec 
  about percent of the company s oregon customers had opted out 
in addition to the oregon customers opting out  the company s washington customers are not covered by weather normalization 
the combination of oregon and washington customers not covered by weather normalization mechanism is less than percent of all residential and commercial customers 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including future contractual obligations and maturities of long term and short term debt 
interest rate risk is managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities and  if permitted  the reduction of debt through optional redemption when interest rates are favorable 
at dec 
 and  the company had no variable rate long term debt and no derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rates 
holders of certain long term debt have put options that  if exercised  would accelerate maturities by million in and by million in each of  and forward looking statements this report and other presentations made by the company from time to time may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended
