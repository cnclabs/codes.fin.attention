gentiva s revenues are generated primarily from three major payer sources the us medicare program  medicaid and other state and county programs  and commercial insurers 
revenue mix by major payer classifications is as follows medicare medicaid and local government commercial insurance and other the medicare and medicaid and related programs are subject to legislative and other risk factors that can result in fluctuating reimbursement rates for gentiva s direct home health services to patients 
the commercial insurance industry is continually seeking ways to control the cost of services to patients that it covers 
one of the ways it seeks to control costs is to require greater efficiencies from its providers  including home health care companies 
despite these risks  gentiva believes it can operate effectively in the current health care climate by increasing its volume of medicare and commercial insurance business and implementing new business practices  technologies and other methods to make the company a more efficient provider of services 
gentiva has made a decision to seek more business from the medicare and commercial insurance payer groups 
for example  in  gentiva s revenue from its medicare and commercial insurance and other excluding cigna payer categories increased percent and percent  respectively  from the prior year 
various states have addressed budget pressures by considering or implementing reductions in various health care programs  including reductions in rates or changes in patient eligibility requirements 
in addition  the company has also decided to taper participation in certain medicaid and other state and county programs 
as a result  gentiva s revenue from this payer category declined percent from the prior year 
gentiva believes that several marketplace factors can contribute to its future growth 
first  the company is a leader in a highly fragmented home health care industry populated by approximately  providers of varying size and resources 
second  the cost of a home health care visit to a patient can be significantly lower than the cost of an average day in a hospital or skilled nursing institution 
and third  the demand for home care is expected to grow  primarily due to an aging us population 
the us centers for medicare and medicaid services projects that national home health and durable medical equipment spending will rise from billion in to billion by the us census bureau has projected that the age and older population will increase more than percent between and the company expects to capitalize on these positive trends through a determined set of strategies  as follows generate growth by focusing on medicare and commercial insurance business  continue to develop and expand specialty programs for incremental revenue growth  focus on clinical associate recruitment  retention and productivity  and continue technology initiatives that make gentiva more efficient and profitable 
the company anticipates executing these strategies by continuing to expand its sales presence  developing and marketing its managed care services  making operational improvements and deploying new technologies  providing employees with leadership training and instituting retention initiatives  ensuring strong ethics and corporate governance  and focusing on shareholder value 
results from these strategies and initiatives are reflected in the company s performance

medicare revenue growth in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was driven by several factors including special items  volume growth  mix and process enhancement changes and rate increases 
medicare revenue included special items of million for fiscal special items represented i million recorded and received during fiscal in settlement of the company s appeal filed with the provider reimbursement review board prrb related to the reopening of its and cost reports and ii a revenue adjustment of million recorded in the fiscal year of to reflect the estimated repayment to medicare in connection with services rendered to certain patients since the inception of the prospective payment reimbursement system in october in connection with the estimated repayments  the cms has determined that homecare providers should have received lower reimbursements for certain services rendered to beneficiaries discharged from inpatient hospitals within fourteen days immediately preceding admission to home healthcare 
medicare admissions grew by percent in fiscal as compared to fiscal medicare revenue was also positively impacted in the fiscal year by growth in specialty programs  which generally generate higher revenue per episode than other medicare services  and by various operational and clinical process enhancements 
furthermore  medicare revenue in the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period increased as a result of reimbursement rate changes  including a percent market basket rate increase that became effective for patients on service on or after october   which was adjusted downward by percent to percent effective april   and a percent rate increase effective april  for the rural add on related to home health services performed in specifically defined rural areas of the country 
the rate increases relating to the market basket change and rural add on provision represented incremental revenue of million for fiscal year medicaid and local government revenue decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a reduction in the company s participation in certain low margin  hourly medicaid and state and county health programs  partially offset by an increase in skilled visits within medicaid programs 
revenues relating to hourly medicaid and state and county programs decreased million for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year revenues relating to skilled visits within medicaid programs increased million for fiscal year commercial insurance and other revenue decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to a decline in revenue derived from cigna of million  or percent  related to a reduction in the number of enrolled cigna members in  and lower revenue as well as related costs resulting from a change in the company s delivery model of certain home medical and respiratory equipment hme products and services 
the decline in cigna revenues was partially offset by an increase of million  or percent  for fiscal year in non cigna  commercial insurance and other revenue driven by unit volume and pricing increases from existing business as well as new contracts signed during the past year 
in addition  for the fiscal year  medicare revenues and commercial insurance and other revenues were negatively impacted by four hurricanes in the southeastern united states and net revenues for fiscal year were positively impacted by an extra week of activity as compared to fiscal year gross profit fiscal year dollars in millions variance gross profit as a percent of revenue as a percent of revenues  gross profit margins for the fiscal year were positively impacted by i percentage points due to the favorable change in business mix in which the volume of medicare business  including growth in specialty programs  more than offset the anticipated revenue loss in certain low margin hourly medicaid and local government programs  ii percentage points due to the reconfiguration of the hme provider network earlier this year  as well as the impact of new carecentrix contracts and iii percentage points related to the special items discussed above 
the remaining increase in gross profit percentage can be attributed to several factors  including the positive medicare rate changes  lower workers compensation expense and various operational and clinical process enhancements 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization  increased million  or percent  to million for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  of the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  approximately million related to the extra week of activity in fiscal approximately million of the remaining increase related to field operating and administrative costs to service incremental revenues  including revenues from the company s specialty programs and approximately million related to higher selling and clinical care coordination expenses

these uses of cash would require the approval of the company s board of directors and may require the approval of its lender

settlement issues prrb appeal as further described in the critical accounting policies section in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company s annual cost reports  which were filed with cms  were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
in connection with the audit of the company s cost reports  the medicare fiscal intermediary made certain audit adjustments related to the methodology used by the company to allocate a portion of its residual overhead costs 
the company filed cost reports for years subsequent to using the fiscal intermediary s methodology 
the company believed its methodology used to allocate such overhead costs was accurate and consistent with past practice accepted by the fiscal intermediary  as such  the company filed appeals with the provider reimbursement review board prrb concerning this issue with respect to cost reports for the years  and the company s consolidated financial statements for the years  and had reflected use of the methodology mandated by the fiscal intermediary 
in june  the company and its medicare fiscal intermediary signed an administrative resolution relating to the issues covered by the appeals pending before the prrb 
under the terms of the administrative resolution  the fiscal intermediary agreed to reopen and adjust the company s cost reports for the years  and using a modified version of the methodology used by the company prior to this modified methodology will also be applied to cost reports for the year  which are currently under audit 
the administrative resolution required that the process to i reopen all cost reports  ii determine the adjustments to allowable costs through the issuance of notices of program reimbursement and iii make appropriate payments to the company  be completed in early cost reports relating to years subsequent to were to be reopened after the process for the cost reports was completed 
in february  the fiscal intermediary notified the company that it had completed the reopening of all cost reports and determined that the adjustment to allowable costs for that year was approximately million 
the company received the funds and recorded the adjustment of million as net revenues during fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the fiscal intermediary notified the company that it had completed the reopening of all cost reports and determined that the adjustment to allowable costs for that year was million 
the company received the funds and recorded the adjustment of million as net revenues during fiscal although the company believes that it will likely recover additional funds as a result of applying the modified methodology discussed above to cost reports subsequent to  the settlement amounts cannot be specifically determined until the reopening or audit of each year s cost reports is completed 
the company expects the cost reports to be reopened and completed during it is likely that future recoveries for the year resulting from the application of the modified methodology required by the administrative resolution will be significantly less than the settlement but greater than the settlement 
the timeframe for resolving all items relating to the cost reports cannot be determined at this time

sfas encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based compensation plans at fair value 
in addition  sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has chosen to adopt the disclosure only provisions of sfas and continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
under this approach  the imputed cost of stock option grants and discounts offered under the company s employee stock purchase plan espp is disclosed  based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants  but not charged to expense

goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
sfas requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into results of operations  but instead are reviewed for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its estimated fair value 
the company adopted sfas as of the beginning of fiscal the provisions of sfas require that a transitional impairment test be performed as of the beginning of the year the statement is adopted 
based on the results of the transitional impairment tests  the company determined that an impairment loss relating to goodwill had occurred and recorded a non cash charge of million  net of a deferred tax benefit of million  as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  the deferred tax benefit was recorded by eliminating a deferred tax liability of million and recording a deferred tax asset of approximately million  offset by an increase in the tax valuation allowance by the same amount 
during fiscal  the company also recorded a tax benefit of approximately million relating to tax deductible goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of sfas also require that a goodwill impairment test be performed annually or on the occasion of other events that indicate a potential impairment 
the annual impairment test of goodwill was performed and indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of january  goodwill amounting to million was included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of january  and december  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

in addition  the company is required to record compensation expense as previous awards continue to vest for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
sfas r will be effective for quarterly periods beginning after june   which for the company is the third quarter of fiscal management estimates that the adoption of sfas r will reduce earnings between and per diluted share in the second half of fiscal in april  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb approved eitf issue  participating securities and the two class method under fas eitf issue supersedes the guidance in topic no

the two class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
in addition  eitf issue addresses other forms of participating securities  including options  warrants  forwards and other contracts to issue an entity s common stock  with the exception of stock based compensation subject to the provisions of apb and sfas eitf issue is effective for reporting periods beginning after march  and should be applied by restating previously reported earnings per share 
the adoption of eitf issue did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most critical estimates relate to revenue recognition  the collectibility of accounts receivable and related reserves  the cost of claims incurred but not reported  obligations under workers compensation  professional liability and employee health and welfare insurance programs and medicare settlement issues 
a description of the critical accounting policies and a discussion of the significant estimates and judgments associated with such policies are described below 
revenue recognition under fee for service agreements with patients and commercial and certain government payers  net revenues are recorded based on net realizable amounts to be received in the period in which the services and products are provided or delivered 
fee for service contracts with commercial payers are traditionally one year in term and renewable automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated by either party 
under capitated arrangements with certain managed care customers  net revenues are recognized based on a predetermined monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the volume of services covered by the capitation arrangement 
net revenues generated under capitated agreements were approximately percent  percent  and percent of total net revenues for fiscal   and  respectively 
under the prospective payment system pps for medicare reimbursement  net revenues are recorded based on a reimbursement rate which varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and certain other factors  revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which services are provided 
revenue is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
medicare billings under pps are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized into revenue over an average patient treatment period 
the process for recognizing revenue to be recognized under the medicare program is based on certain assumptions and judgments  including the average length of time of each treatment as compared to a standard day episode  the appropriateness of the clinical assessment of each patient at the time of certification and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits  have significant changes in condition or are subject to certain other factors during the episode 
deferred revenue of approximately million and million relating to the medicare pps program was included in other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets as of january  and december   respectively 
revenue adjustments result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payer and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
revenue adjustments are deducted from gross accounts receivable 
these revenue adjustments are based on significant assumptions and judgments which are determined by company management based on historical trends 
third party settlements resulting in recoveries are recognized as net revenues in the period in which the funds are received 
collectibility of accounts receivable the process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables  particularly with respect to fee for service arrangements  involves significant assumptions and judgments 
in this regard  the company has implemented a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on accounts receivable aging trends 
historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  the company assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues to determine the impact  if any  on its reserve estimates  which involve judgment 
revisions in reserve estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts which is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company believes that its collection and reserve processes  along with the monitoring of its billing processes  help to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection  reimbursement experience and billing functions 
cost of claims incurred but not reported under capitated arrangements with managed care customers  the company estimates the cost of claims incurred but not reported based on applying actuarial assumptions  historical patterns of utilization to authorized levels of service  current enrollment statistics and other information 
under fee for service arrangements with certain managed care customers  the company also estimates the cost of claims incurred but not reported and the estimated revenue relating thereto in situations in which the company is responsible for care management and patient services are performed by a non affiliated provider 
the estimate of cost of claims incurred but not reported involves significant assumptions and judgments which relate to and may vary depending on the services authorized at each of the company s regional coordination centers  historical patterns of service utilization and payment trends 
these assumptions and judgments are evaluated on a quarterly basis and changes in estimated liabilities for costs of claims incurred but not reported are determined based on such evaluation 
obligations under insurance programs the company is obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including workers compensation and professional liability and employee health and welfare 
the company may be subject to workers compensation claims and lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims 
the company maintains various insurance programs to cover this risk with insurance policies subject to substantial deductibles and retention amounts 
the company recognizes its obligations associated with these programs in the period the claim is incurred 
the cost of both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits  have generally been estimated based on historical data  industry statistics  the company s own home health specific historical claims experience  current enrollment statistics and other information 
such estimates and the resulting reserves are reviewed and updated periodically 
for the fiscal year ended december   the company recorded a special charge of million relating primarily to a refinement in the estimation process used to determine the company s actuarially computed workers compensation and professional liability reserves 
management believes that  as a result of this refinement  sufficient data exists to allow the company to more heavily rely on its own home health specific historical claims experience in determining the company s estimates of workers compensation and professional liability reserves 
previously the company utilized insurance industry actuarial information  as well as the company s historical claims experience in developing reserve estimates 
the company maintains insurance coverage on individual claims 
the company is responsible for the cost of individual workers compensation claims and individual professional liability claims up to  per incident which occurred prior to march  and  per incident thereafter 
the company also maintains excess liability coverage relating to professional liability and casualty claims which provides insurance coverage for individual claims of up to  in excess of the underlying coverage limits 
payments under the company s workers compensation program are guaranteed by letters of credit and segregated restricted cash balances 
as of january   the company has segregated cash funds of million as collateral under the company s workers compensation program 
interest on the funds in the trust account accrues to the company 
the company  at its option  may terminate the trust agreement by providing equivalent amounts of alternative security allowed under the program  including letters of credit and surety bonds 
the company believes that its present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but there can be no assurance that the company will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or in excess of its insurance limits 
medicare settlement issues prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home care nursing services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act of these costs were reported in annual cost reports which were filed with the cms and were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not finalized its audit of the fiscal cost reports 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
although management believes that established reserves are sufficient  it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits could result in adjustments to the consolidated financial statements that exceed established reserves 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had no interest rate exposure on fixed rate debt or other market risk at january
