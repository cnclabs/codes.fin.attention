item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview newspaper industry considerations our financial performance reflects  to a meaningful extent  conditions in the newspaper industry 
we believe that our customers spending for capital investment  and therefore  demand for our equipment  are affected by fluctuations in advertising revenue and newsprint cost 
specifically  we believe the growth in our business is somewhat reflective of the growth in newspaper advertising revenues  offset by any increases in newsprint costs 
similarly  we believe that a decline in advertising revenues generally will adversely affect capital equipment spending by newspapers and  as a result  will adversely affect our financial performance 
on a longer term basis  we believe that capital investment patterns have been  and will continue to be  affected by reduction in newspaper circulation and industry consolidation 
according to published reports  newspaper circulation in the united states has decreased by an average of approximately each year from to with news and other information immediately available on competing media such as television  radio and the internet  we anticipate that this circulation trend will continue 
while reduced circulation could negatively affect demand for our products  we believe the consolidation of newspaper ownership in recent years has had a positive impact on our business 
in many cases  when large newspaper and media groups have acquired small newspapers and newspaper chains  the acquiring groups centralize the production and distribution of multiple newspapers located in a geographic area to one or a few sites 
the operation of centralized production and distribution facilities typically require the purchase of additional automated equipment 
therefore  consolidation could enhance demand for our products 
based on published financial reports and discussions with our customers  we believe that major newspaper chains generally derive over of their revenues from advertising 
preliminary statistics obtained from the newspaper association of america naa indicate that newspaper advertising revenue increased in compared to this increase is lower than historical levels 
additionally  recent estimates by naa and other published reports by analysts indicate an expectation that the trend of lower than historical increases in advertising revenue will continue into  mostly due to competition for advertising dollars by other media and reports of newspaper circulation misstatements 
based on public filings of financial reports of many newspaper chains  newsprint represents a significant operating expense for newspaper publishers 
according to published reports  newsprint prices increased approximately in with an expected similar increase in we believe that the higher newsprint pricing trends may have an adverse effect on capital spending demands of newspaper publishers in our booked orders totaled  compared to  in we believe that the larger volume of orders received in reflected pent up demand by newspaper publishers  who deferred capital spending during the prior two year period due to adverse economic conditions affecting the newspaper industry 
furthermore  we believe our order levels reflect current advertising revenue growth trends in the newspaper industry 
we do not believe that we will be able to maintain the rate of growth in net sales that we experienced in the last two years solely through our current product line 
therefore  we will be seeking to identify and effect strategic acquisitions that can enhance our position in the newspaper post press market or provide reasonable modest diversification 
we cannot assure  however  that we will be successful identifying and completing such acquisitions 
effect of contract terms on cash generation  revenue recognition most of our sales are made on a contract basis 
a typical sales contract requires a customer to pay for its purchase in installments as follows due at the time of the order  due days prior to shipment  due days prior to shipment  due upon installation and due upon acceptance 
contract payment terms vary for some orders and may be based on achieving agreed upon milestones 
while cash is collected throughout the order process  revenue is recognized only when all significant contract obligations are satisfied and collection of outstanding receivables are reasonably assured in accordance with our revenue recognition policy see note 
we normally receive larger orders several months in advance of delivery 
therefore  backlog can be an important  though by no means conclusive  indication of our short term revenue stream 
the timing of revenues can be affected by pending orders  the amount of custom engineering required  the timetable for delivery  the time required to complete installation and the receipt of new orders 
our backlog  as of december  and december   was  and  respectively 
we expect to ship all orders in our december  backlog within months 
results of operations vs 
net sales net sales for were  an increase of  from net sales of  most of the increase is due to higher sales volume of core products including stackers  bottomwrappers and conveyor equipment 
the greater net sales are due mostly to the higher volume of orders booked in the second half of and the resulting strong backlog entering into additionally  in we recognized net sales of approximately  from our recently introduced quipp packman packaging system 
sales to foreign customers were  in compared to  in most of our foreign sales presently are made to newspapers in canada where equipment specifications are similar to those in the us sales to foreign customers fluctuate from year to year as opportunities to sell our equipment outside the united states arise 
gross profit gross profit for was  an increase of  from gross profit of  for the corresponding period in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales is mainly due to the production and installation of complex systems 
in general  we expected margins to be lower on these projects due to competitive pricing pressures  system complexity and additional customization requirements 
nevertheless  we incurred higher than expected costs on complex systems  including custom software development costs for systems integration  additional production and installation costs on newer products for which we had limited experience  including an in line inserter system and waste handling systems  and rework costs for a gripper conveyor system that was subsequently returned by the customer 
our gripper conveyor has been redesigned to enhance its performance in certain applications 
costs related to the redesign of the gripper conveyor were charged to research and development 
additionally  as a result of slow incoming orders during the third quarter in  our overhead absorption was negatively affected by a one week plant shutdown and shortened work weeks for production personnel  coupled with a shutdown for two days due to hurricane conditions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  as compared to  for we incurred higher variable selling and administrative costs such as commission and warranty expense due to improved net sales 
additionally  we incurred higher test equipment expenses due to a greater number of prospective customers evaluating our equipment as we recently introduced the quipp packman packaging system 
also  we incurred an increase in selling  general and administrative costs from expenses associated with compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of selling  general and administrative costs in included costs related to professional fees associated with the implementation of a shareholder rights plan and a special meeting of shareholders held in response to the demand of a shareholder 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in due to expenses related to compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
because we are not an accelerated filer for purposes of sec regulations  we will be required to comply with provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of relating to management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and an audit of internal control over financial reporting in connection with our financial statements for the year ended december  we have retained and are working with consultants to assist us in our compliance efforts 
research and development research and development expenses for were  an increase of  as compared to  in in  we devoted much of our research and development resources to our new in line c inserting collating system with poly wrapping capabilities 
in addition  we expended research and development resources to redesign our gripper conveyor to enhance the performance of the product in certain applications  and we completed the software for the quipp packman packaging system 
for the same period in  we focused much of our engineering and technical efforts on the development of the quipp packman packaging system 
other income and expense net other income and expense net in was  as compared to  for the same period in interest income increased to  from  mostly due to the collection of the final installment of an outstanding note receivable from an international customer 
all principal and interest payments on the note receivable had previously been applied only to the principal balance due to uncertainties regarding collectability of the note 
interest relating to the note was recognized upon receipt of the final installment 
additionally  we received  of royalty income relating to our patented automatic cart loading system technology used by another supplier of post press material handling equipment 
we received  of royalty income during the same period in results of operations vs 
net sales net sales for were  an increase of  from net sales of  we believe that our newspaper customers curtailed post press capital equipment purchases in due to a decline in advertising revenue during and the first half of published reports indicate that advertising revenues for newspapers have increased modestly beginning in the second half of and through  we believe that our sales reflect this growth 
in addition  we recognized sales totaling  from our new inserter product line obtained through the acquisition of assets from usa leader  inc gross profit gross profit for was  an increase of  from gross profit of  for the corresponding period in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in from in the improvement of gross profit as a percentage of sales was due in part to the allocation of fixed manufacturing overhead costs to a greater volume of production and shipments 
additionally  we incurred lower production and installation cost overruns in than in during the first six months of  we generated higher than expected costs from the production and installation on some larger custom orders 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  as compared to  for the increase was due primarily to changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts  incurrence of non recurring costs  and increase in selling  marketing and amortization costs 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  in  in contrast to a  reduction in allowance for doubtful accounts for the corresponding period in the net increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts was due to the deterioration of the financial condition of one of our customers  offset in part by collection of old accounts receivable balances that were previously reserved 
the reduction in the accounts receivable reserve in resulted from our collecting customer receivable balances that were previously reserved 
non recurring costs of approximately  related to a special meeting of shareholders held in response to the demand by a shareholder and professional fees associated with the implementation of a shareholder rights plan 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative costs relate to marketing costs for our recently introduced in line and packman product lines  amortization expense relating to identifiable intangible assets from usa leader acquisition and higher variable selling expenses 
research and development research and development expenses for were  an increase of  as compared to  in in we devoted engineering and technical efforts to develop the quipp packman packaging system 
the majority of our research and development costs represented expenditures for the development of our stacker  a high resolution ink jet printer for our viper bottomwrapper product line and initiation of our quipp packman project 
other income and expense net other income and expense net in was  as compared to  for the same period in the decrease is primarily due to lower royalty income relating to our automatic cart loading system and lower interest rates on our securities available for sale 
additionally  in  we realized gains of  on the sale of securities 
liquidity and capital resources over the past several years  our cash generation has been more than sufficient to support our operations 
while our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale decreased by  at december  compared to the same date in the previous year  much of the decrease relates to increased inventory and receivables related to progress billings in connection with the sale of a large and complex order that required an extended period of time to design  manufacture and install 
accordingly  we expect our balance of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale to improve when we recognize revenue and cost of sales and collect the receivables that are contractually due upon system start up and acceptance 
on march   we entered into a  line of credit arrangement 
interest is payable monthly at a rate equal to the one month libor rate plus 
collateral on the line of credit includes all accounts receivable  inventory  intangibles and contract rights as well as securities with value of no less than  as of the date of this report  we have not drawn on the line of credit 
our long term debt consists solely of obligations under variable rate industrial revenue bonds that were issued through the dade county industrial development authority in at december   the balance due on the bonds was  of which  is classified as a current liability on our balance sheet 
during  the bonds bore interest at an average rate of 
the following table provides information relating to certain of our material contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years purchase commitments   industrial revenue bonds     on december   cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale totaled  as compared to  at december  the reduction in cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale resulted principally from increased inventory and receivables in connection with the sale of a large and complex order that required an extended period of time to design  manufacture and install 
as this system is completed  the company expects to recognize revenue and cost of sales and collect the receivables that are contractually due upon system start up and acceptance 
also  our receivables increased as a high volume of fourth quarter shipments occurred during the last days of the year 
working capital at december  was  an increase of  from  at december  the improved working capital is due mostly to net income generated in as noted in the overview section above  we may effect strategic acquisitions to enhance our position in the newspaper post press market or provide reasonable market diversification 
if any acquisition is effected  it may require a significant cash investment  nevertheless  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations at the current level 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
we discuss below the more significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
our senior management has discussed the application of these estimates with our audit committee 
revenue recognition revenue from contracts that include multiple element arrangements  such as a sale of standard equipment and basic installation services  is recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue on standard equipment is recognized upon delivery in accordance with contractual terms  net of discounts 
the fair value of installation services is deferred until the installation is completed 
management reviews objective evidence such as prices charged when each element is sold separately and selling prices on similar elements sold by competitors in making judgment as to the fair value for each element of the contract 
revenue from long term complex system arrangements  such as a sale of complex equipment  controls and software  is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue recognition is measured by units delivered 
on such contracts  management makes judgments regarding costs and profitability estimates measuring progress toward completion 
these judgments are subject to some degree of uncertainty  and unanticipated efforts necessary to complete a complex system could adversely affect operating results in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
nevertheless  there is a risk that credit losses in the future will exceed our expectations  in which case our operating results would be adversely affected 
warranty reserves we record a warranty reserve based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
while our warranty costs have generally been within our expectations and the provisions established  future returns or repair costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
additionally  we do not have extensive warranty claims experience with recently introduced products 
a significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the costs to repair our products would adversely affect our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize 
intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of usa leader  inc  we estimated the value of that company s patent  other technology and customer list  as well as non competition agreements we obtained as a part of this transaction 
because the value of these assets is not certain  there was a degree of subjectivity in allocating fair value to the assets 
the determination of fair value of the assets can have an impact on depreciation and amortization expense  because the useful lives of such assets vary from years to years 
moreover  in the event that the value of such assets are deemed to be impaired in the future  we would be required to charge the amount of the impairment to selling  general and administrative expenses 
market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because our cash and investments exceed short and long term debt  the exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
due to the short term maturities of our investments  we believe there is no significant risk arising from interest rate fluctuations 
to ensure safety and liquidity  we only invest in instruments with credit quality and which are traded in a secondary market 
the counterparties are major financial institutions and government agencies 
inflation the rate of inflation has not had a material impact on operations
