item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
in this report  atherogenics  we  us and our refer to atherogenics  inc this annual report contains forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are subject to certain factors  risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  events and performances to differ materially from those referred to in such statements 
these risks include statements which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  such as projections about our future results of operations or financial condition  research  development and commercialization of our product candidates  anticipated trends in our business  and other risks that could cause actual results to differ materially 
you should carefully consider these risks  which are discussed in this annual report  including  without limitation  in this section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in atherogenics securities and exchange commission filings 
overview atherogenics is a research based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases  including coronary heart disease  organ transplant rejection  rheumatoid arthritis and asthma 
we have developed a proprietary vascular protectant  or v protectant  technology platform to discover drugs to treat these types of diseases 
based on our v protectant platform  we have two drug development programs in clinical trials and are pursuing a number of other preclinical programs 
agi is our v protectant that is most advanced in clinical development 
agi is designed to benefit patients with coronary heart disease  or chd  which is atherosclerosis of the blood vessels of the heart 
we are currently evaluating agi in the phase iii clinical trial called arise aggressive reduction of inflammation stops events as an oral therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis 
agi  our second candidate  is a novel antioxidant and selective anti inflammatory agent which is being developed to address the accelerated inflammation of grafted blood vessels  known as transplant arteritis  common in chronic organ transplant rejection 
we are working with fujisawa pharmaceutical co  ltd 
to further develop agi in preclinical and early stage clinical trials 
we previously were developing agix  a v protectant candidate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
based on our findings  however  we have discontinued clinical development of agix and the intravenous dosage form of agix for rheumatoid arthritis 
we continue to have an active program aimed at investigating other v protectants in rheumatoid arthritis and have identified other compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential within our rheumatoid arthritis preclinical models 
we are working to select another candidate to move into formal preclinical development 
we have also identified additional potential v protectant candidates to treat other chronic inflammatory diseases  including asthma 
we are evaluating these v protectants to determine lead drug candidates for clinical development 
we plan to develop these compounds rapidly and may seek regulatory fast track status  if available  to expedite development and commercialization 
we will continue to expand upon our v protectant technology platform using functional genomics to identify novel therapeutic gene targets 
functional genomics is the process by which one uses scientific models and techniques to discover and modify genes  measure the consequences of the modifications  and reliably determine the function of those genes 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development 
we have not derived any commercial revenues from product sales and  excluding the effect of certain license fees of a non recurring nature  expect to incur significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity and debt securities 
we have incurred significant losses since we began operations and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we cannot assure you whether or when we will become profitable 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses over the next several years as we continue to incur increasing research and development costs 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to complete the successful development of our product candidates  to obtain required regulatory clearances  and to manufacture and market our future products 

table of contents critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
research and development accrual as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate expenses that we believe we have incurred  but have not yet been billed for 
this process involves identifying services and activities that have been performed by third party vendors on our behalf and estimating the level to which they have been performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of expenses for which we accrue include fees for professional services  such as those provided by certain clinical research organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees owed to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the manufacture of clinical trial materials 
we make these estimates based upon progress of activities related to contractual obligations and also information received from vendors 
revenue recognition license fees  which are nonrefundable  are recognized when the related license agreements specify that no further efforts or obligations are required of us 
we had committed to perform certain research and development activities as part of a license agreement  which has been terminated  accordingly  the upfront license payment was amortized over the anticipated time period to conduct these activities 
revenues under research and development arrangements were recognized as the research and development activities were performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
these revenues were billed quarterly and the related payments were not refundable 
stock based compensation we have elected to follow accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for our stock based employee compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as sfas requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
we account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees  in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  an amendment to sfas  requires disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas and supersedes apb sfas r requires that companies recognize compensation expense associated with stock option grants and other equity instruments to employees in the financial statements and is effective as of the first reporting period that begins after june  sfas r applies to all grants after the effective date and to the unvested portion of stock options outstanding as of the effective date 
under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the permitted transition methods are either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested options at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the modified retrospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested options beginning with the first period presented 
under the modified retrospective method  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial 
table of contents statement recognition 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues during or we may receive revenues in the future related to potential licensing agreements with pharmaceutical companies for our compounds or programs 
expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase of million  or  is primarily due to increased expenditures for the agi arise phase iii clinical trial  including manufacturing activities for clinical drug supply  study monitoring  payments to clinical investigators  and salary and personnel related expenses 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in this increase will be primarily related to activities surrounding the agi arise phase iii clinical trial and precommercialization development activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase of  or  is primarily due to a full year s impact of the increase in directors and officers insurance premiums in compared to a partial year s impact of the increase in premiums in  an increase in professional fees in connection with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and consulting fees 
also contributing to the increase were business development expenses related to partnering activities  along with salary and personnel expenses 
interest and other income interest and other income is primarily comprised of interest income earned on our cash and short term investments 
interest and other income was million in  compared to million in the slight increase is due to the increase in the weighted average cash and short term investment balances along with an increase in interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense is due to a full year of interest expense resulting from our million long term convertible debt  issued in august  compared to a partial year in we anticipate that interest expense will increase in due to our recent issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
the net operating loss carryforwards and the research and development credit carryforwards will expire between and because of our lack of earnings history  the resulting deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the utilization of the carryforwards is dependent upon the timing and extent of our future profitability 
the annual limitations combined with the expiration dates of the carryforwards may prevent the utilization of all of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards if we do not attain sufficient profitability by the expiration dates of the carryforwards 

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues during or expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to increased expenditures for the agi arise phase iii clinical trial and the agix oscar phase ii clinical trial  such as manufacturing activities for clinical drug supply  study monitoring and payments to clinical investigators 
also contributing to the increase were the ongoing patient related costs for the agi cart phase iib clinical trial 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase of  or  was primarily due to an increase in directors and officers insurance premiums  consulting fees and business development expenses related to partnering activities  partially offset by a lower amount of deferred stock compensation expense 
interest and other income interest and other income is primarily comprised of interest income earned on our cash and short term investments 
interest and other income was million in  compared to  in the increase is due to the increased amount of invested funds received from our follow on offering in february and our convertible debt offering in august interest expense interest expense was million in compared to  in the increase in interest expense is primarily comprised of interest expense resulting from our million long term convertible debt  issued in august income taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and convertible notes 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared with million and million at december  and  respectively 
working capital at december  was million  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital for the year ended december  is primarily due to the use of funds for operating purposes 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital for the year ended december  is primarily due to funds received from our follow on stock offering in february of approximately million and our convertible debt offering in august of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in the use of cash in operating activities in is principally due to funding a net loss of million 
the increase in cash needed to fund the net loss is primarily attributable to expenditures for our arise phase iii clinical trial for agi  our cart phase iib clinical trial for agi  and our oscar phase ii clinical trial for agix  as well as other ongoing product development activities 
for and  expenditures for the arise clinical trial are estimated to be approximately million while expenditures for cart and oscar are essentially completed 
we anticipate net cash usage in for arise and our other on going preclinical and clinical programs  as well as our other operating activities  to be in a range of million to million 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in and million provided by investing activities in net cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of net sales of available for sale securities  with the proceeds reinvested in interest bearing cash equivalents 
net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of net purchases of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of the proceeds received upon exercise of common stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million received from our follow on stock offering in february and million received from our convertible debt offering in august net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of proceeds from an equipment loan facility and the exercise of common stock options 
in march  we entered into an equipment loan facility  as modified in june  with silicon valley bank for up to a maximum amount of million to be used to finance existing and new equipment purchases 
the borrowing period under the equipment loan facility  as modified  expired on september  at december   there was an outstanding balance of approximately  on the equipment loan facility and the weighted average interest rate was per year 
in august  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due through a rule a private placement to qualified institutional buyers 
these notes initially are convertible into our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  or approximately per share 
net proceeds were approximately million 
as of december   we have recorded million of accrued interest expense related to the notes  which is due march  on january   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due through a rule a private placement to qualified institutional buyers 
these notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  or approximately per share 
interest on the convertible notes is payable semi annually in arrears on february and august net proceeds were approximately million 
we are using the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund the ongoing costs of the arise phase iii clinical trial for agi and other research and development activities  including clinical trials  process development and manufacturing support  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
pending these uses  the net proceeds have been invested in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter operating leases  net of sublease income long term debt total contractual obligations based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  along with the funds received from the convertible notes issued in january  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next months 
however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and results of our research  preclinical and clinical development activities  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to establish and maintain collaborations and the financial terms of any collaborations  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  the costs related to purported class action lawsuits filed against us  and 
table of contents the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies 
we have historically accessed the capital markets from time to time to raise adequate funds for operating needs and cash reserves 
although we believe we have adequate cash for at least the next months  we may access capital markets when we believe market conditions or company needs merit doing so 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  all of which have a minimum investment rating of a p  money market funds  and government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
the following table summarizes the maturity of the debt and projected annual average interest rates on our equipment loan facility and convertible notes as of december  value as of december  total long term debt fixed rate maturity average interest rate
