item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general we are a leading owner and operator of short line and regional freight railroads in the united states  canada  mexico  australia and bolivia 
we also provide freight car switching and related services to united states industrial companies with railroad facilities within their complexes 
we generate revenues primarily from the movement of freight over track owned or operated by our railroads 
we also generate non freight revenues primarily by providing rail car switching  car hire associated with our railcars and other ancillary rail services 
our operating expenses include wages and benefits  equipment rents including car hire associated with other railroads railcars  purchased services  depreciation and amortization  diesel fuel  casualties and insurance  materials  net gain loss on sale and impairment of assets  and other expenses 
car hire is a charge paid by a railroad to the owners of railcars used by that railroad in moving freight 
other expenses generally include property and other non income taxes  professional services  communication and data processing costs  and general overhead expense 
when comparing our results of operations from one reporting period to another  you should consider the fact that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to one time freight moves  customer plant expansions and shut downs  sales of land and equipment  accidents and derailments 
in periods when these events occur  results of operations are not easily comparable to other periods 
also  we have completed a number of recent acquisitions 
because of variations in the structure  timing and size of these acquisitions our operating results in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our operating results in other reporting periods 
certain of our commodity shipments are sensitive to general economic conditions in north america  including paper products in canada  chemicals in the united states  and cement in mexico 
however  shipments of other important commodities such as coal and salt are less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by the weather

us and canadian credit facilities on november   we entered into amended and restated five year  million unsecured senior credit facilities 
we used the proceeds from the financing to repay million of approximately million of debt outstanding at our us and canadian subsidiaries 
approximately million of the borrowing capacity is reserved for letters of credit for two of our subsidiaries 
the remaining unused borrowing capacity is available for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
the amended and restated credit facilities are composed of a million revolving loan and a million c million canadian term loan  both of which are due in interest rates for borrowings are based on us or canadian libor plus a margin  which varies from to depending on leverage 
initial borrowings were priced at libor plus 
the credit facilities are unsecured  but the revolving loan is guaranteed by substantially all of our us subsidiaries and the canadian term loan is guaranteed by substantially all of our us and canadian subsidiaries 
financial covenants  which are measured on a trailing twelve month basis and reported quarterly  include a maximum leverage of times measured as funded debt indebtedness plus guarantees including letters of credit  plus the present value of operating leases to ebitdar earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rental payments on operating leases  b minimum interest coverage of times measured as ebitda divided by interest expense  c required net worth equal to of net worth as of september  plus of net income for each quarter ending after september   and d maximum annual capital expenditures excluding acquisitions of million 
fifty percent of unutilized permitted capital expenditures may be utilized in the succeeding year 
the credit facilities contain a number of covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make certain investments  sell assets  issue subsidiary stock  restrict distributions from subsidiaries  create certain liens  enter into certain consolidations or mergers  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  and pay dividends or make distributions 
the credit facilities allow us to pay dividends and make distributions provided that funded debt to ebitdar  including any borrowings made to fund the dividend or distribution  is less than to we were in compliance with the provisions of these covenants as of december  in conjunction with the refinancing  we recorded a non cash pre tax write off of million related to unamortized deferred financing costs of the refinanced debt and a cash expense of  for the termination of interest rate swaps related to the former debt 

table of contents senior notes on november   we completed a seven year  million private placement of unsecured fixed rate senior notes 
the senior notes were priced at a spread of over the year us treasury and are due in we used the proceeds from the million financing to repay million of approximately million of debt outstanding at our us and canadian subsidiaries 
the senior notes are unsecured  but are guaranteed by substantially all of our us subsidiaries 
the senior notes contain a number of covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  create certain liens  enter into certain consolidations or mergers and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
financial covenants  which are reported quarterly  include a maximum debt to capitalization of and b minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of times measured as ebitdar for the preceding twelve months divided by interest expense plus operating lease payments for the preceding twelve months 
we were in compliance with the provisions of these covenants as of december  mexican financings on december   one of our subsidiaries in mexico  servicios  entered into three promissory notes payable notes totaling million with variable interest rates based on libor plus percentage points with the international finance corporation ifc as the primary lender 
two of the notes  aggregating million  have an year term with combined semi annual principal payments of million which began march   and continue through the maturity date of september  the third note  in the amount of million  has a year term with semi annual principal payments of  which began march   and continue through the maturity date of september  the notes are secured by essentially all the assets of servicios and its subsidiary  compania de ferrocarriles chiapas mayab  sa de sa  fccm  and a pledge of genesee wyoming s shares of servicios and fccm 
we are obligated to provide up to million of funding to our mexican subsidiaries  if necessary  to meet their investment or financial obligations prior to completing the investment phase of the project funded by the notes physical completion  consisting of several obligations related to capital investments  operating performance and management systems and controls 
in addition  we are obligated to provide million in funding to servicios to meet its debt service obligations prior to completing the financial phase of the project financial completion  consisting of several financial performance thresholds 
at present  fccm has yet to achieve physical completion or financial completion 
to date  we have advanced million of this obligation  and based on current circumstances  it is probable that we will have to fund additional payments in order to meet the future principal repayment obligations of the notes 
we have entered into discussions with the ifc to restructure the terms of the notes to reduce our need to fund portions of future principal repayment obligations of the notes 
the notes contain certain financial and other covenants with which servicios and fccm are in compliance as of december  in conjunction with the notes  the ifc invested million of equity in servicios for a indirect interest in fccm 
along with its equity investment  ifc received a put option exercisable in to sell its equity stake back to genesee wyoming 
the put price will be based on a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
if the value of the put option exceeds the minority interest liability  additional minority interest expense would be recorded 
exercise of this put option by the ifc would result in a future cash outflow for us 
mexican fuel tax credits in  fccm could apply diesel fuel tax credits that it generated to reduce payroll taxes and value added taxes  and it utilized approximately million in such fuel tax credits 
during  tax authorities issued a ruling that limited the application of diesel fuel tax credits to income tax related obligations only  excluding payroll taxes and value added taxes 
effective january  as a result of new fuel tax legislation  fccm will again be permitted to apply diesel fuel tax credits that it generates to reduce a variety of its federal tax obligations  including income taxes  payroll taxes and value added taxes 
while the new legislation is a favorable development  under the fuel tax formula at current high diesel fuel prices  fccm is paying no fuel 
table of contents taxes and therefore is not currently generating diesel fuel tax credits 
fccm is in discussions with the mexican tax authorities concerning its ability to utilize million of previously generated fuel tax credits 
if permitted  fccm would expect to utilize these fuel tax credits in and subsequent years 
if fccm is unable to utilize the million of fuel tax credits that it generated in and or is unable to generate future fuel tax credits due to the current formula  it will be more difficult for fccm and servicios to satisfy their debt obligations thereby increasing the expected amount of support we will have to provide to fccm and servicios 
south america we have a indirect ownership interest in ferroviaria oriental  sa oriental which is located in eastern bolivia 
we hold our equity interest in oriental through a number of intermediate holding companies  and we account for our interest in oriental under the equity method of accounting 
we indirectly hold a equity interest in oriental through an interest in genesee wyoming chile gwc  and we hold our remaining equity interest in oriental through other companies 
gwc is an obligor of non recourse debt of million  which has an adjustable interest rate dependent on operating results of oriental 
this non recourse debt is secured by a lien over gwc s indirect equity interest in oriental 
this debt became due and payable on november  due to the political and economic unrest and uncertainties in bolivia  it has become difficult for gwc to refinance this debt and we have chosen not to repay the non recourse obligation 
gwc entered into discussions with its creditors on plans to restructure the debt  and as a result of those discussions  gwc obtained a written waiver of principal repayment from the creditors which expired on january  however  negotiations with the creditors continue  and currently  none of gwc s creditors have commenced court proceedings to i collect on the debt or ii exercise their rights pursuant to the lien 
if we were to lose our equity stake in oriental due to creditors exercising their lien on gwc s indirect equity interest in oriental  we would write off our investment in oriental held through gwc  which on december  amounted to  a default  acceleration or effort to foreclose on the lien under the non recourse debt will have no impact on our remaining equity interest in oriental because that equity interest is held indirectly through holding companies outside of gwc s ownership in oriental 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the million debt  we discontinued equity accounting for our equity interest in oriental held through our interest in gwc 
oriental has no obligations associated with the million debt 
in addition  a default  acceleration or effort to foreclose on the lien under the non recourse debt would not result in a breach of a representation  warranty  covenant  cross default or acceleration under our senior credit facility 
equipment leases we are party to several cancelable leases which have automatic renewal provisions 
if we choose not to renew these leases  we would be obligated to return the underlying rolling stock and pay aggregate fees of up to approximately million 
in addition  we have the option  at various dates  to terminate the leases by purchasing the rolling stock 
the maximum aggregate purchase price  at the next available buyout date for each qualifying lease  is approximately million 
management anticipates the future market value of the leased rolling stock will equal or exceed the payments necessary to purchase the rolling stock 
as noted previously  in november  tzpr entered into a year lease agreement for the assets of the ppu see note to consolidated financial statements 
future lease payments of million annually are subject to adjustment based on certain economic indicators and customer operations stipulated in the agreement 
government grants some of our railroads have entered into a number of rehabilitation or construction grants with state and federal agencies 
we use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs 
in return for the 
table of contents grants  the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and maintenance on the rail lines that have been rehabilitated or constructed 
we believe that the levels of service and maintenance required under the grants are not materially different from those that would be required without the grant obligation 
in addition to government grants  customers occasionally provide fixed funding of certain track rehabilitation or construction projects to facilitate our service over that track 
we record any excess in the fixed funding compared to the actual cost of rehabilitation and construction as gains in the current period 
we received government grants totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
however  we can offer no assurance that government grants will continue to be available or that even if available  our railroads will be able to obtain them 
budgeted capital expenditures we have budgeted approximately million in capital expenditures in  of which million is for track rehabilitation  including the completion of the homer city branch  and million is for equipment 
we have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations  while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we believe that our cash flow from operations together with amounts available under the credit facilities will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of the credit facilities

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  actual results may differ from such estimates 
the diversity of our services  customers  geographic operations  sources of supply and markets reduces the risk that any one event could have a severe impact on our operating results 
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting are discussed below 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to us in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations requires management to use judgment and make estimates 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
as of january  under this pronouncement  a two step goodwill impairment model is used 
step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill would be considered impaired and step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
for intangible assets the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we test impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or when triggering events occur 
recoverability and realization of tangible assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that our long lived tangible assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of assets in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred 
if impairment were identified  a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques available in the circumstances 
we closely monitor our assets in foreign operations where fluctuating currencies and unsettled economic conditions can create greater uncertainty 
we adopted sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective january  derailment and property damages  personal injuries and third party claims we maintain insurance  with varying deductibles up to  per incident for liability and up to  per incident for property damage  for claims resulting from train derailments and other accidents related to our railroad and industrial switching operations 
accruals for fela claims by our railroad employees and third party personal injury or other claims  limited when appropriate to the applicable deductible  are recorded when such claims are determined to be probable and estimates are updated as information develops 
pensions and other post retirement benefits we administer two noncontributory defined benefit plans for union and non union employees of two us subsidiaries 
benefits are determined based on a fixed amount per year of credited service 
our funding policy is to make contributions for pension benefits based on actuarial computations which reflect the long 
table of contents term nature of the plans 
we have met the minimum funding requirements according to the employee retirement income security act 
we provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain union employees of south buffalo 
as of december   thirty nine employees were participating and fifty current employees may become eligible for these benefits upon retirement if certain combinations of age and years of service are met 
we fund the plan on a pay as you go basis 
we provided health care and life insurance benefits to certain nonunion retired employees who had reached the age of with or more years of service 
in october  we terminated the health care and life insurance benefits effective january we evaluated the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of act on our postretirement plan and the act did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or disclosure requirements 
income taxes we file consolidated us federal income tax returns which include all of our us subsidiaries 
each of our foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in their respective countries 
no provision is made for the us income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries 
if the earnings were to be distributed in the future  those distributions may be subject to us income taxes appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
the amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of december  was million 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of us income and foreign withholding taxes that could be payable if a distribution of earnings were to occur 
deferred income taxes reflect the net income tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as available income tax credits 
in our consolidated balance sheets  these deferred benefits and deferred obligations are classified as current or non current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting 
a deferred tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  including deferred tax assets related to carry forwards  are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year 
we had net operating loss carry forwards from our mexican operations in and of million and million  respectively 
the mexican losses  for income tax purposes  relate to the immediate deduction of a portion of the purchase price paid for the fccm operations and interest expense incurred in the holding company  servicios 
these loss carry forwards will expire between and we had net operating loss carry forwards from our canadian operations as of december  and of million and million  respectively 
the canadian losses represent losses generated prior to our gaining control of those operations in april these loss carry forwards will expire in a significant portion of the deferred tax benefits relate to the mexican net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe that a valuation allowance need not be recorded because we expect our mexican business will more likely than not generate sufficient taxable income to utilize all of the deferred tax assets 
fccm is currently profitable and at current levels we estimate it will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize its net operating loss carry forwards prior to the date of expiration 
in addition  management believes that a contemplated restructuring of the mexican business will more likely than not enable us to use the future taxable income to offset the remaining net operating losses of servicios prior to the date of expiration 
as of december   the deferred tax asset attributable to the canadian net operating loss carry forward had been fully offset by a valuation allowance of  in  the valuation allowance was reduced to zero due to a combination of two canadian companies  and in management s opinion the net operating loss will more likely than not be utilized by the surviving company 
the valuation allowance was established in the acquisition of gro  and accordingly  the reversal only affects balance sheet accounts 

table of contents on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act contains two railroad related tax provisions which will benefit our us railroads beginning in the act created a track maintenance tax credit for class ii railroads  class iii railroads and certain other parties equal to of qualifying track maintenance expenditures but limited to  times the number of miles of qualifying railroad track owned or leased at the end of each applicable year 
the tax credit may only be earned on maintenance work undertaken from january  through december  although the irs has not yet issued implementing regulations related to this provision  we expect a reduction in our us effective tax rate over this three year period 
the act also repeals the cents per gallon excise tax on locomotive diesel fuel which is to be phased out between and management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 
risk factors our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in our forward looking statements  including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents which are filed or furnished with the sec 
general risks associated with genesee wyoming if we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments  we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy 
our growth strategy is based on us expanding through selective acquisitions of and investments in rail properties  both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate 
the success of our growth strategy will depend on  among other things the availability of suitable candidates  the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources  our ability to value acquisition and investment candidates accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those acquisitions and investments  our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners  and the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the acquired businesses 
if we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy  the market price for our class a common stock may be adversely affected 
our inability to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business 
we have experienced significant growth through acquisitions and we expect to continue to grow through additional acquisitions 
acquisitions generally result in increased operating and administrative costs and  to the extent financed with debt  additional interest costs 
we may not be able to manage or integrate the acquired companies or businesses successfully 
the process of combining acquired businesses may be disruptive to our 
table of contents business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors  among others loss of key employees or customers  possible inconsistencies in or conflicts between standards  controls  procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement company wide financial  accounting  information technology and other systems  failure to maintain the quality of services that the companies have historically provided  integrating employees of rail lines acquired from class i railroads  governments or other entities into the our regional railroad culture  failure to coordinate geographically diverse organizations  and the diversion of management s attention from our day to day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so 
these disruptions and difficulties  if they occur  may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings  revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies  and may cause material adverse short and long term effects on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations  we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings  revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition 
the expected revenue enhancements and cost savings are based on analyses completed by members of our management 
these analyses necessarily involve assumptions as to future events  including general business and industry conditions  operating costs and competitive factors  many of which are beyond our control and may not materialize 
while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions to be reasonable  they are estimates which are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  even if we achieve the expected benefits  we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame 
also  the cost savings and other synergies from these acquisitions may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies  increases in other expenses  operating losses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions 
we may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to forego potential acquisitions  which would harm our financial condition and operating results 
since  we have acquired railroads  the majority of which were for cash 
we intend to continue to review acquisition candidates and potential purchases of railroad assets  and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria 
we expect that  as in the past  we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of any acquisitions or purchases that we make 
depending on the number of acquisitions or purchases and the prices of the acquisitions  we may not generate enough cash from operations to pay for the acquisitions or purchases 
we may  therefore  need to raise substantial additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to forego potential acquisitions  which would harm our financial condition and operating results 
because we depend on class i railroads and other connecting carriers for our north american operations  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate 
the railroad industry in the us and canada is dominated by class i carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage 
almost all of the traffic on our us and canadian railroads is 
table of contents interchanged with class i carriers 
a decision by any of these class i carriers to use alternate modes of transportation  such as motor carriers  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to  among other matters  freight rates  revenue divisions  car supply  reciprocal switching  interchange and trackage rights 
a deterioration in the operations of  or service provided by  those connecting carriers  or in our relationship with those connecting carriers  would adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  much of the freight transported by our us and canadian railroads moves on railcars supplied by class i carriers 
if the number of railcars supplied by class i carriers is insufficient  we might not be able to obtain replacement railcars on favorable terms or at all and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation 
portions of our us and canadian rail properties are operated under leases  operating agreements or trackage rights agreements with class i carriers 
failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases and agreements in all material respects could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties  which would adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
class i carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us  as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators 
because we depend on class i carriers for our us and canadian operations  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with those carriers deteriorate 
while the majority of our mexican revenues originates and terminates on the our railroad  we are dependent on our relationship with a connecting carrier for the remainder of our revenues 
to the extent that we experience service disruptions with that connecting carrier  our ability to serve existing customers and expand our business will suffer 
we face competition from numerous sources  including those relating to geography  substitutable products  other types of transportation and other rail operators 
each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers 
our railroads  however  compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally motor carriers and  on some routes  ship  barge and pipeline operators 
we are also subject to geographic and product competition 
for example  a customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations or could substitute one commodity for another commodity that is not transported by rail 
in either case  we would lose a source of revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the extent of this competition varies significantly among our railroads 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged  the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required 
in addition  competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided 
because a large majority of our freight moves involve interchange with another carrier  we have only limited control over the price  transit time or quality of such service 
any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate  or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations 
the failure to comply with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to governmental regulation in the us by a significant number of federal  state and local regulatory authorities  including the stb  the federal railroad administration and state departments of transportation  with respect to our railroad operations and a variety of health  safety  labor  environmental and other matters 
we are also subject to regulatory authorities in the other countries in which it operates 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  governments may change the regulatory framework 
table of contents within which we operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
also  some of the regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses  permits and other authorizations  and we may not continue to be able to do so 
we could incur significant costs for violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations 
our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to waters  and the handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases 
environmental liability to us may arise from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us  properties leased by us  and other properties owned by third parties  for example  properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated  stored  spilled or disposed of  as well as at properties currently owned by us 
under some environmental statutes  such liability may be without regard to whether we were at fault  and may also be joint and several  whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we or the entity that gives rise to our liability was only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability 
environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties or other third parties affected by environmental conditions for example  contractors and current or former employees seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or with personal injury or death  as well as by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations 
environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs  including significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
some of our employees belong to labor unions  and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the united states  mexico  australia  canada and bolivia 
in north america  we are party to contracts with national labor organizations 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to of those agreements 
we have also entered into employee bargaining agreements with an additional employees who represent themselves 
in each of western australia and new south wales  arg has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of employees 
during  arg completed a re negotiation of the western australia and new south wales collective enterprise bargaining agreements  each of which has a term of approximately three years 
in south australia  arg has one collective bargaining agreement that expired in september this agreement is currently being renegotiated and is expected to be completed in april our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
if the unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  or other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and or higher ongoing labor costs  which in either case could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are also subject to the risk of the unionization of our non unionized employees which could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility 
in addition  work interruptions may be threatened which could cause cessation of operations with a corresponding adverse financial impact 
if we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers that posses the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities 
the operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh conditions 
in 
table of contents addition  our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force 
the demand for workers with these types of skills has recently become high  especially by class i railroads that can usually offer higher wages and better benefits  and the supply is limited 
moreover  a large portion of our current skilled workers will become retirement eligible over the next few years 
a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force  increases in the wage rates that we must pay or both 
if either of these events were to occur  our cost structure could increase  our margins could decrease and our growth potential could be impaired  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the occurrence of losses or other liabilities which are not covered by insurance or which exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we have obtained for each of our railroads insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences 
unexpected or catastrophic circumstances such as accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials could cause our liability to exceed our insurance limits 
insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at our current levels or obtain it on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly applicable to us may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and or our self insured retentions and could result in limitations to the coverage under our existing policies 
the occurrence of losses or other liabilities which are not covered by insurance or which exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
rising fuel costs could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses 
fuel costs for fuel used in operations were approximately and of our operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fuel costs for fuel used in operations were approximately and of arg s operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fuel prices and supplies are influenced significantly by factors beyond our and arg s control  such as international political and economic circumstances 
if diesel fuel prices increase dramatically or if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from production curtailments  a disruption of oil imports or otherwise  these events could have a material adverse effect on our and arg s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in north america  the ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our operating revenues in  and  respectively 
in  our largest north american customer was a company in the paper and forest products industry which accounted for approximately of our north american revenues 
in and  our largest customer was a coal fired electricity generating plant which accounted for approximately of our operating revenues 
arg s ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and of its operating revenues in  and  respectively 
in  and  arg s largest customer was awb limited which accounted for approximately  and respectively  of arg s operating revenues 
the loss of one or more of the our or arg s largest customers or the loss or material modification of one or more key contracts with such customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy as well as to severe weather conditions 
in any given year  we  like other railroads  are susceptible to changes in the economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce and consume the freight we transport 
in addition  many of the goods and commodities carried by us experience cyclicality in their demand 
our results of operations can be expected to reflect this cyclicality because of the significant fixed costs inherent in railroad operations 
should 
table of contents an economic slowdown or recession occur in north america or in the other countries in which we operate  the volume of rail shipments carried by us is likely to be affected 
in addition to the inherent risks of the business cycle  we are occasionally susceptible to adverse weather conditions 
for example arg s grain revenues may be reduced by drought drought conditions during the growing season resulted in a significant reduction in arg s grain shipments in  our coal revenues may be reduced by cold summers and warm winters  which lessen electricity demand  and our minerals and stone revenues  which includes salt  may be reduced by snow free and ice free winters in the northeastern united states  which lessens demand for road salt 
bad weather and natural disasters  such as blizzards in eastern canada and the northeastern united states and hurricanes in mexico  could also cause a shutdown or substantial disruption of operations which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
material adverse weather may not directly affect our operations but rather the operations of our customers or connecting carriers 
such weather conditions could reduce or suspend their operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results  financial conditions and liquidity 
furthermore  our expenses could be adversely impacted by weather  including as a result of higher track maintenance and overtime costs in the winter in our new york  pennsylvania and canada regions as well as by possible track washouts in mexico during the rainy season 
the development of some of our business could be hindered if we fail to maintain satisfactory working relationships with partners 
some of our operations are conducted through joint ventures  in which we own a significant  but less than a controlling  ownership interest 
in particular  we own a interest in arg and a interest in our bolivian operations 
in these operations  we do not have absolute control over the operations of the venture 
the particular corporate governance provisions affecting our interests vary from venture to venture  but in general  we must obtain the cooperation of our partners in order to implement and expand upon our business strategies 
any failure to maintain satisfactory working relationships with these partners or the need to expend significant management resources and time to align our interests with the interests of these partners could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
acts of terrorism or anti terrorism measures may adversely affect us 
our rail lines  port operations and other facilities and equipment  including rail cars carrying hazardous materials  which we are required to transport under federal law  could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks 
any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition  and liquidity 
in addition  regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service  which could also adversely affect our operating results  financial condition  and liquidity 
additional risks associated with our foreign operations we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 
some of our significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries  namely in canada  mexico and we have equity investments in australia and bolivia 
in addition  we may consider acquisitions in other foreign countries in the future 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include adverse renegotiation or modification of existing agreements or arrangements with governmental authorities  adverse changes or greater volatility in the economies of those countries  
table of contents adverse effects of currency exchange controls  adverse currency movements that make goods produced in those countries which are destined for export markets less competitive  adverse changes to the regulatory environment of those countries  adverse changes to the tax laws and regulations of those countries  restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings  the nationalization of the businesses that we operate  the actual or perceived failure by us to fulfill commitments under concession agreements  the potential instability of foreign governments  including from domestic insurgency  and the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation 
because some of our significant subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies  and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries  future exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
our operations in mexico and canada accounted for and of consolidated revenues  respectively  and arg accounted for of consolidated net income for the year ended december  the results of operations of our foreign operations are reported in the local currency the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the mexican peso and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
the functional currency of our bolivian operations is the us dollar 
the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future 
we cannot assure that we will be able to effectively manage our exchange rate risks and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  because our financial statements are stated in us dollars  such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
failure to meet concession commitments with respect to operations of our rail lines could result in the loss of our investment and a related loss of revenues 
we have entered into long term concession and or lease agreements with governmental authorities in mexico  bolivia  south australia and western australia 
these concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions  including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to safety  service  price and the environment 
these concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures 
our failure to meet these commitments under the long term concession and lease agreements could result in the loss of those concession or lease agreements 
the loss of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our entire investment relating to that concession or lease agreement and the related revenues and income 
australia s open access regime could lead to additional competition for arg s business and decreased revenues and profit margins 
australia s open access regime could lead to additional competition for arg s business  which could result in decreased revenues and profit margins 
the legislative and regulatory framework in australia allows third party rail operators to gain access to arg s railway infrastructure  and in turn governs arg s access to track owned by others 
arg currently operates on the commonwealth owned interstate network from sydney  new south wales and melbourne  victoria to kalgoorlie  western australia and on state owned track in new south wales 
access charges are paid for access onto the track of other companies  and access 
table of contents charges under state and federal regimes continue to evolve because privatization of railways in australia is recent 
where arg pays access fees to others  if those fees are increased  arg s operating margins could be negatively affected 
in addition  if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter a regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third party rail freight operators by arg in western australia or south australia do not meet competitive standards  then arg s income from those fees could be negatively affected 
when arg operates over track networks owned by others  including commonwealth owned and state owned networks  the owners of the network rather than the operators are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the network in satisfactory condition 
therefore  in areas where arg operates over tracks owned by others  it is subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network is not adequately maintained 
either risk could affect arg s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
arg may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in the australian agricultural industry because a substantial portion of arg s railroad traffic consists of agricultural commodities 
arg derives a significant portion of its rail freight revenues from shipments of grain 
for the years ended december   and  grain shipments generated approximately  and  respectively  of arg s operating revenues 
a decrease in grain shipments as a result of adverse weather or other negative agricultural conditions could have a material adverse effect on arg s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
for example  drought conditions during the growing season resulted in a significant reduction in arg s grain shipments in arg may be subject to significant additional expenditures in order to comply with commonwealth and or state regulations 
in addition to the open access requirements described above  other aspects of rail operation are regulated  safety in particular  on both a commonwealth and a state by state basis 
arg has received safety regulatory approval to operate on commonwealth owned track  in the northern territory and in all states except queensland and tasmania 
changes in safety regulations or other regulations or the imposition of new regulations or conflicts among state and or commonwealth regulations could require arg to make significant expenditures and to incur significant expenses in order to comply with these regulations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we actively monitor our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks 
we use derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures 
we do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone  nor do we use instruments where there are not underlying cash exposures 
complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used 
we manage our hedging positions and monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and do not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance 
management believes that our use of derivative instruments to manage risk is in our best interest 
however  our use of derivative financial instruments may result in short term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk results from issuing variable rate debt obligations  since an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
the table below provides amounts outstanding and corresponding interest rates for our fixed and variable rate debt and our use of interest rate swaps to mitigate increases in interest rates 
principal amount of long term debt and interest rate swaps december  dollars in thousands fixed rate debt average fixed interest rate variable rate debt swapped to fixed rate debt average fixed interest rate unswapped variable rate debt average variable interest rate total long term debt average interest rate future amounts of variable rate debt that we have swapped to fixed rate debt are as follows as of year ending december million in  million in table assumptions variable interest rates the table presents variable interest rates based on us and canadian libor rates as of december  plus an average borrowing margin of approximately 
the borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of for debt under our us and canadian credit facilities and for debt related to our mexican operations 

table of contents interest rate swaps the table presents dollar amounts outstanding under interest rate swaps as of december   in which we have swapped a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the table also presents the average fixed interest rate under these swaps which is equal to our fixed pay rates to counterparties plus our borrowing margin 
interest rate sensitivity based on the table above  assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates  annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately  foreign currency risk the functional currency of our mexican operations is the mexican peso  while the debt obligations are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we face exchange rate risk if the mexican peso were to depreciate relative to the us dollar  thereby generating lower us dollar equivalent cash and earnings to pay the principal and interest on the debt 
our risk management policy seeks to mitigate this risk by purchasing one year forward currency options on the us dollar mexican peso exchange rate that approximate projected us dollar principal and interest payments that will be funded by available peso denominated cash  so as to lessen the impact of a severe peso depreciation 
debt related to our canadian and australian operations is denominated in the respective local currencies 
therefore  foreign currency risk related to debt service payments does not exist at our canadian and australian operations 
us dollar denominated principal and projected interest obligations of mexican peso denominated operations thereafter total dollars in thousands principal payments interest payments total principal and interest payments are due on march and september of each year 
based on month us libor as of december  plus a borrowing margin of 
foreign currency options settlement date march  september  total dollars in thousands  except exchange rates receive us dollar pay mexican pesos notional amount average exchange rate in mexican pesos per us dollar sensitivity of foreign currency to debt service payments we expect our mexican operations to fund approximately million of the total million of us dollar denominated principal and interest payments in based on the cash flow needs of the mexican operations  we have the expectation of making an approximate million loan to our mexican operations 
if the value of the mexican peso were to weaken ten percentage points relative to the us dollar while mexican peso denominated earnings and cash flows remained constant  then it would be equivalent to the mexican operations being required to support an additional  in debt service payments 
based on an exchange rate of mexican pesos per us dollar as of december   this exposure in is capped at a maximum of  by the foreign currency options shown in the table 

table of contents diesel fuel price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices  since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows 
in the year ended december   fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented of our total expenses and of total expenses at our owned australian operations 
as of december   neither we nor our owned australian operations had entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk 
sensitivity to diesel fuel prices as of december   each one percentage point increase in the price of fuel would result in a  increase in our annual fuel expense and a  increase in arg s annual fuel expense consumed in operations
