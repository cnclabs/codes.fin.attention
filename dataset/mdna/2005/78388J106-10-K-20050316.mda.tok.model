item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the risks related to our business section of this annual report 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below 
see forward looking statements and risks related to our business 
we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the eastern third of the united states 
we generate revenues from our two businesses  site leasing and site development 
in our site leasing business  we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own  manage for or lease from others 
the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a carrier  built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired 
in our site development business  we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 
revenues derived from the leasing of antenna space at  or on  communication towers continued to increase as a result of our emphasis on our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites 
we focus our leasing and site development activities in the eastern third of the united states where substantially all of our towers are located 
during  we completed our previously announced plan of disposing of our services business in the western third of the united states 
operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results 
you should be aware of the changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results 
restatement of financial results on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
in light of this letter  we initiated a review of our accounting practices and determined that we would adjust our method of accounting for certain types of ground leases underlying our tower sites and amortization of tower assets 
as a result  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended december  and included in this report 
we had historically defined the minimum lease term of our ground leases underlying our tower sites as the initial term of the leases and had been straight lining all rental payments due to the lessor evenly over this term  which typically is five years in length 
as a result of the february  letter from the sec  we changed our rental expense recognition policy to redefine the minimum lease term as the period from lease inception through the end of the term in which all tenant lease obligations in existence at ground lease inception  including renewal periods  will be met 
if no tenant lease obligations existed at the date of ground lease inception  the initial term of the ground lease is considered the minimum lease term 
all rental obligations due to be paid out over the minimum lease term  including fixed escalations  have therefore been straight lined evenly over the minimum lease term 
additionally  if the minimum lease term ends prior to the originally established depreciable life of the tower typically years  we have shortened the depreciable life of the tower to coincide with the minimum lease term of the ground lease 
as a result of the adjustments described above  the accompanying results of operations for the years ended december  and have been adjusted to record additional rent expense included in cost of sales on the statements of operations of million and million  respectively  additional depreciation expense of million and million  respectively  a reduction of asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively  a decrease in provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively  and a decrease increase in loss from discontinued operations of million and million  respectively 
the consolidated balance sheets have been adjusted to record additional straight line rent liabilities included in other long term liabilities of million and million  a reduction in fixed assets of million and million  as well as a decrease in assets held for sale of million and million  at december  and  respectively 
additionally  retained earnings deficit have been reduced by million and million at december  and  respectively 
these adjustments did not have any impact on the cash flows of the company see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for a summary of the effects of these changes on our consolidated balance sheets as of december   as well as on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the years ended december  and the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections 
site leasing services site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies 
revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts 
each site leasing contract relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years  and is renewable for five year periods at the option of the tenant 
almost all of our site leasing contracts contain specific rent escalators  which average per year  including the renewal option periods 
site leasing contracts are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements 
rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 
cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of rental payments on ground and other underlying property leases  straight line rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the minimum lease term which may include renewal terms of the underlying property lease  repairs and maintenance exclusive of employee related costs  utilities  insurance  and property taxes 
for any given tower  such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period 
as such  operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower 
the table below details the percentage of total company revenues and gross profit contributed by site leasing services 
information regarding the total and percentage of assets used in our site leasing services business is included in note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
percentage of revenues gross profit contribution for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  site development services our site development services business consists of two segments  site development consulting and site development construction  through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of end to end services 
in the consulting segment of our site development business  we offer clients the following services network pre design  site audits  identification of potential locations for towers and antennas  support in buying or leasing of the location  and assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 
in the construction segment of our site development business  we provide a number of services  including  but not limited to the following tower and related site construction  antenna installation  and radio equipment installation  commissioning and maintenance 
site development services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies or companies providing development or project management services to wireless communications companies 
our site development customers engage us on a project by project basis  and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty 
site development projects  both consulting and construction  include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis 
the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis 
time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered 
our site development projects generally take from three to months to complete 
for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis  we bill the client  and recognize revenue  based on the completion of agreed upon phases of this project on a per site basis 
upon the completion of each phase  we recognize the revenue related to that phase 
our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract 
this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts 
these amounts are based on estimates  and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion 
revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities  which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients capital expenditures  the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period  weather and other factors 
cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue include all costs of materials  salaries and labor costs  including payroll taxes  subcontract labor  vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects 
all costs related to site development consulting projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 
the table below provides the percentage of total company revenues and gross profit contributed by site development services 
information regarding the total and percentage of assets used in our site development services businesses is included in note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
percentage of revenues gross profit contribution site development consulting site development construction in may  our board of directors approved a plan of disposition related to the western site development services 
in june  two business units were sold  and two business units were closed within western site development services 
in the third quarter of  the remaining two site development construction business units were sold 
gross proceeds realized from sales during the fiscal year ended december  were million  and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million was recorded  which is included in loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
in other cases  management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included herein 
our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 
construction revenue revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract 
this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract 
these amounts are based on estimates  and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion 
the asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 
asset impairment we evaluate the potential impairment of individual long lived assets  principally the tower sites 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site 
we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment  including but not limited to  general market and economic conditions  historical operating results  geographic location  lease up potential  and expected timing of lease up 
in addition  we make certain assumptions in determining an asset s fair value less costs to sell for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge 
changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value less costs to sell which is different from management s estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in addition  if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect  a future impairment charge may be required 
asset retirement obligations effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas under the new accounting principle  we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made and we accrete such liability through the obligation s estimated settlement date 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over its estimated useful life 
significant management estimates and assumptions are required in determining the scope and fair value of our obligations to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of ground leases 
in determining the scope and fair value of our obligations  assumptions were made with respect to the historical retirement experience as an indicator of future restoration probabilities  intent in renewing existing ground leases through lease termination dates  current and future value and timing of estimated restoration costs  and the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount future obligations 
while we feel the assumptions were appropriate  there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from estimates 
we will review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results as our gross profit mix shifts more towards site leasing

by comparison  in we recognized approximately million of asset impairment charges related to towers 
the impairment of operational tower assets resulted primarily from our evaluations of the fair value of our operating tower portfolio through a discounted cash flow analysis 
towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no tenants and or with little or deteriorating prospects for future lease up 
in addition  the asset impairment charge included million of goodwill impairment that was recorded during the first two quarters of  which was determined to be impaired during june when the transitional impairment test of goodwill was performed under sfas in february  as a result of the deterioration of capital market conditions for wireless carriers  we reduced our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities  suspended any new investment for additional towers  reduced our workforce and closed or consolidated offices

even if we decided to pay a dividend  we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend 
furthermore  the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our senior credit facility and the indenture for the senior discount notes and the senior notes 
a summary of our cash flows is as follows for the year ended december  in thousands summary cash flow information cash provided by operating activities cash provided by investing activities cash provided by financing acitivities increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  december  cash and cash equivalents  december  sources of liquidity in december  sba communications and telecommunications co issued million of aggregate principal amount at maturity of their senior discount notes  which produced net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering expenses 
a portion of the proceeds from the senior discount notes were used to tender  repurchase and redeem all of our senior discount notes during the first quarter of and to repurchase a portion of our senior notes during the quarter ended march  during january  sba senior finance closed on a new senior credit facility in the amount of million 
this new credit facility consists of a million term loan which was funded at closing  a million delayed draw term loan and a million revolving line of credit

one or more of the alternatives may include the possibility of issuing additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock  or converting existing indebtedness into shares of common stock  any of which would dilute our existing shareholders 
we cannot assure you that any of these strategies can be consummated  or if consummated  would effectively address the risks associated with our significant level of indebtedness 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  included in this amount is million related to a decrease in short term investments associated with the sale of trading securities 
additionally  growth in our site leasing business during the year ended december  also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities  offset by a net increase of other working capital items 
uses of liquidity during the first quarter of  we repurchased and redeemed all million of our outstanding senior discount notes 
during the year ended december  we repurchased in the open market million of our outstanding senior notes

additionally  during the year ended december   we paid approximately million of cash for interest on our various debt instruments 
as a result of our refinancing activities discussed above and the effect of this offering  our cash interest requirements for are expected to be significantly lower than our requirements in our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  which was comprised of million of tower upgrades and other capital improvements  million of new tower construction  million of earn outs and acquisitions  and million for general corporate expenditures 
due to the relatively young age of our towers and remaining capacity available to accommodate new tenants  it is not necessary for us to spend a significant amount of funds for capital improvements or modifications to our towers to accommodate new tenants 
we estimate we will incur approximately  per tower per year on maintenance capital expenditures 
for  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million to million primarily in connection with our plans to build to new towers 
additionally  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million to million primarily in connection with acquiring towers during the first quarter of all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand  cash flow from operations and availability under our senior credit facility 
the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio 
debt service requirements at december   we had million outstanding of our senior notes 
this amount includes a million deferred gain related to the termination of a derivative instrument in these notes were redeemed in full on february  at the call price of of the aggregate principal amount

the issuance of our senior notes in december as well as the repurchase of million of senior notes in december pursuant to a tender offer and the redemption of the remaining million of senior notes in february is expected to result in a cash savings of approximately million in debt service payments in capital instruments senior notes and senior discount notes our senior notes are unsecured and are pari passu in right of payment with our other existing and future senior indebtedness 
our senior discount notes were co issued by us and telecommunications in december  are unsecured  rank pari passu with the senior indebtedness and are structurally senior to all indebtedness of sba communications 
the senior notes  and the senior discount notes place certain restrictions on  among other things  the incurrence of debt and liens  issuance of preferred stock  payment of dividends or other distributions  sale of assets  transactions with affiliates  sale and leaseback transactions  certain investments and our ability to merge or consolidate with other entities

the new senior credit facility requires sba senior finance to maintain specified financial ratios  including ratios regarding its debt to annualized operating cash flow  debt service  cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter 
this new senior credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  restrict its ability to incur debt and liens  sell assets  commit to capital expenditures  enter into affiliate transactions or sale leaseback transactions  and or build towers without anchor tenants 
additionally  this facility permits distributions by sba senior finance to telecommunications and sba communications to service their debt  pay consolidated taxes  pay holding company expenses and for the repurchase of senior notes or senior discount notes subject to compliance with the covenants discussed above 
sba senior finance s ability in the future to comply with the covenants and access the available funds under the senior credit facility in the future will depend on its future financial performance 
as of december   we were in full compliance with the financial covenants contained in this agreement 
registration statements we have on file with the commission shelf registration statements on form s registering up to a total of million shares of class a common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services at various locations in the united states 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of class a common stock under these registration statements in connection with the acquisition of five towers and related assets 
as of december   we had  million shares of class a common stock remaining available under these shelf registration statements 
subsequent to december   we issued  shares under these shelf registration statements in partial payment of the purchase price in connection with the acquisition of towers 
we have on file with the sec a universal shelf registration statement registering the sale of up to million of any combination of the following securities class a common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares or warrants 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  we cannot assure you that a change in the rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised sfas no 
 share based payment statement r  which is effective for our third quarter of fiscal statement r requires companies to expense in their consolidated statement of operations the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
we are currently evaluating which application method will be applied once sfas r is adopted 
depending on the model used to calculate stock based compensation expense in the future  the implementation of certain other requirements of statement r and additional option grants expected to be made in the future  the pro forma disclosure may not be indicative of the stock based compensation expense that will be recognized in our future financial statements 
we are in the process of determining how the new method of valuing stock based compensation as prescribed in statement r will be applied to valuing stock based awards granted after the effective date and the impact the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on its financial statements 
the effective date of certain elements of sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity statement  has been delayed indefinitely by the fasb 
these elements of statement require that noncontrolling interests in limited life subsidiaries be classified as liabilities 
as a result of this indefinite delay  we have not adopted these elements of statement the company has adopted the other elements of statement  for which the effective date was not delayed 
currently  we do not expect that the adoption of the remaining elements of statement will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb no
