within the chassis group  the motorhome chassis line had a sales increase of million over the fiscal year 
the increase was due primarily to an increase in volume  resulting from additional business secured by the chassis group from two of its top three customers 
production related to the majority of this additional business began in the middle of the third quarter of offsetting some of this market share gain was a softening in motorhome industry sales that began late in the year

the increase in evteam sales for was a result of increases at road rescue and crimson fire aerial  offset by lower sales at crimson fire 
the increase at road rescue was due to the production ramp up at road rescue to a higher run rate

lower sales from the chassis group to the evteam caused intercompany sales to decrease million over the prior year 
intercompany sales are eliminated from the consolidated sales totals 
the decrease in evteam sales is primarily due to transitions at road rescue and crimson 
the company closed road rescue s st 
paul  minnesota facility and consolidated its ambulance operations at its new marion  south carolina facility 
the marion plant ramped up more slowly than anticipated  resulting in lower sales in in addition  the merger of luverne and quality into crimson slowed production as staff was consolidated and production efforts were aligned 
this resulted in lower fire apparatus deliveries at the start of than in the previous year 
within the chassis group  the motorhome chassis line had sales decrease million over the fiscal year 
several economic uncertainties at the start of and related economic developments associated with the war in iraq had a negative impact on the volume of motorhome sales in  which was the primary reason for the sales decrease 
the chassis group s other primary product line  fire truck chassis  had an increase of million in sales for the year ended december  over the year ended december  the chassis group received orders for more than fire truck chassis  the most ever in a single year

initial operating inefficiencies at the evteam s marion plant and million of costs incurred in connection with the transfer of operations from st 
paul to the marion plant also contributed to the decrease 
in addition  the lower sales volumes noted earlier played a role as fixed overhead costs were spread over a lower production volume 
lastly  a higher cost of certain components  including engines meeting the more stringent federally mandated emissions standards  were a factor in the decrease in margins 
operating expenses decreased minimally between years  but as a percentage of sales grew from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily as a result of lower sales volumes

effect of inflation inflation affects the company in two principal ways 
first  the company s debt  if any  is generally tied to the prime and libor rates so that increases affecting interest rates may be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  the company attempts to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of its products 
however  the company generally does not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into its contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as six months  the company has limited ability to pass on cost increases to its customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets served by the company are competitive in nature  and competition limits the pass through of cost increases in many cases 
the company strives to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is a change in interest rates in connection with its outstanding variable rate short term and long term debt 
however  at december   the company had no debt outstanding under its variable rate short term and long term debt agreements
