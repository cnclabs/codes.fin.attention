item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil and condensate that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future crude oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates 
therefore  neither the pre tax nor after tax sec pv value amounts shown above should be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
the information set forth in the foregoing tables includes revisions of certain volumetric reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions are the result of additional information from subsequent completions and production history from the properties involved or the result of a decrease or increase in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in production prices

information regarding coal royalty and land management properties at december   the partnership s coal reserves were located on  acres  including fee and leased acreage  in virginia  west virginia  new mexico and eastern kentucky 
the coal reserves are in various surface and underground seams 
as of december   the partnership had approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves  which are found in the following six separate properties the wise property  located in wise and lee counties  virginia and letcher and harlan counties  kentucky  the coal river property  located in boone  fayette  kanawha  lincoln and raleigh counties  west virginia  the new mexico property  located in mckinley county  new mexico  the northern appalachia property  located in barbour  harrison  lewis  monongalia and upshur counties  west virginia  the spruce laurel property  located in boone and logan counties  west virginia  and the buchanan property  located in buchanan county  virginia 
reserves are coal tons that can be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination considering legal  economic and technical limitations 
proven coal reserves are reserves for which a the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling  and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely  and the geologic character is so well defined  that the size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable coal reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are more widely spaced or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
in areas where geologic conditions indicate potential inconsistencies related to coal reserves  the partnership performs additional exploration to ensure the continuity and mineablility of coal reserves 
consequently  sampling in those areas involves drill holes that are spaced closer together than those distances cited above 
reserve estimates are adjusted annually for production  unmineable areas  acquisitions and sales of coal in place 
the majority of pvr s reserves are high in energy content  low in sulfur and suitable for either the steam or metallurgical market 
the amount of coal a lessee can profitably mine at any given time is subject to several factors and may be substantially different from proven and probable reserves 
included among the factors that influence profitability are the existing market price  coal quality and operating costs

these estimates are compiled using geological data taken from thousands of drill holes  geophysical logs  adjacent mine workings  outcrop prospect openings and other sources 
these estimates also take into account legal  qualitative  technical and economic limitations that may keep coal from being mined 
reserve estimates will change from time to time due to mining activities  analysis of new engineering and geological data  acquisition or divestment of reserve holdings  modification of mining plans or mining methods and other factors the partnership s timber assets consist of various hardwoods  primarily red oak  white oak  yellow poplar and black cherry

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of financial condition and results of operations of penn virginia corporation and subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview penn virginia corporation penn virginia or the company is an independent energy company that is engaged in two primary business segments 
our oil and gas segment explores for  develops  produces and sells crude oil  condensate and natural gas primarily in the eastern and gulf coast onshore areas of the united states 
our coal royalty and land management segment operates through our percent ownership in penn virginia resource partners  lp the partnership or pvr 
penn virginia and pvr are both publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbols pva and pvr  respectively 
due to our control of the general partner of pvr  the financial results of the partnership are included in our consolidated financial statements 
however  pvr functions with a capital structure that is independent of the company  consisting of its own debt instruments and publicly traded common units 
the following diagram depicts our ownership of pvr 
table of contents logo as a result of our ownership in the partnership  we receive cash payments from pvr in the form of quarterly cash distributions 
we received approximately million of cash distributions from pvr during as part of our ownership of pvr s general partner  we also own the rights  referred to as incentive distribution rights  to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after certain levels of cash distributions have been achieved 
as of december   pvr had achieved a level of distribution to allow us to receive an increased percentage of available cash 
see item  business coal royalty and land management operations  for more information on incentive distribution rights 
we are committed to increasing value to our shareholders by conducting a balanced program of investment in our two business segments 
in the oil and gas segment  we expect to continue to execute a program combining relatively low risk  moderate return development drilling in appalachia  mississippi and east texas and north louisiana with higher risk  higher return exploration and development drilling in the onshore gulf coast  supplemented periodically with acquisitions 
in addition to our conventional development program  we have continued to expand our presence in unconventional plays by developing cbm gas reserves in appalachia 
by employing horizontal drilling techniques  we expect to continue to increase the value from the cbm prospective properties we own 
we are committed to expanding our oil and gas reserves and production primarily by using our ability to generate exploratory prospects and development drilling programs internally 
we budgeted approximately million for oil and gas capital expenditures in we do not budget major acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
borrowings against our credit facility were million out of million available as of december   and we expect to fund our budgeted capital expenditures with internal cash flow  supplemented by credit facility borrowings as needed 
in the coal royalty and land management segment  pvr continually evaluates acquisition opportunities that are accretive to cash available for distribution to pvr unitholders  of which we are the largest single unitholder 
these opportunities include  but are not limited to  acquiring additional coal properties and reserves  acquiring or constructing assets for coal services  which would provide a fee based revenue stream  and acquiring mid stream natural gas assets 
during the first quarter of  pvr made capital expenditures of approximately million  plus usual closing adjustments  for the acquisition of a midstream natural gas business from cantera natural gas llc cantera 
pvr funded this acquisition at closing with debt from a new  expanded credit facility  which pvr expects to reduce with proceeds from an anticipated secondary public offering of common units during the first quarter of pvr also anticipates capital expenditures of million for coal services related projects and other property and equipment  which it believes can be funded with cash flow provided by operating activities 
performance oil and gas segment our oil and gas strategy has been to increase our presence in cbm and other unconventional natural gas to build a significant inventory of predictable  low risk development prospects  and to selectively drill exploration opportunities which could make a meaningful difference to the company s production and reserve profile 
during  we believe progress was made in each area 
in  we increased our oil and gas production to bcfe  a three percent increase over bcfe produced in this increase was the result of production from successful exploratory drilling projects in south louisiana 
table of contents and the east texas and north louisiana cotton valley project  increased drilling in our mississippi selma chalk fields and our appalachia horizontal cbm project 
this increase was offset primarily by production declines in several south texas fields and a curtailment on two natural gas pipelines serving the company s assets in southern west virginia  which particularly affected the deliverability of the horizontal cbm program 
the curtailments lasted from may through october and restricted production by approximately bcf 
average daily oil and gas production increased to mmcfe in the fourth quarter of compared to mmcfe in the fourth quarter of we took steps to prevent future curtailments in order to accommodate the expected increases in gas volumes from our horizontal cbm program 
we constructed a mile  inch pipeline and acquired long term firm transportation on columbia gas transmission s pipeline system effective in the fourth quarter of commodity prices  in particular for natural gas  were the largest single factor affecting our financial results in price volatility in the natural gas market has been high in the last few years 
throughout  and  the nymex futures market traded at record price levels for natural gas 
our realized natural gas price in was per mcf  net of per mcf hedging loss 
as part of our risk management strategy  we use financial instruments to hedge natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil prices 
our total oil and gas reserves at the end of were bcfe  an increase of percent over approximately percent of our reserves at year end were natural gas 
net of revisions  we added approximately bcfe of proved reserves primarily from extensions  discoveries and additions  replacing percent of our production of bcfe 
we drilled a total of gross net wells during  including gross net development wells and gross net exploratory wells 
one development well net and seven gross net exploratory wells were not successful and gross net exploratory wells were under evaluation at december  during  we continued to expand our cbm production and reserve base in central appalachia through leasehold acquisitions and the use of a proprietary horizontal drilling technology 
the technology is owned by our partner  and we have the right to use the technology under our agreement with our partner in a  square mile area of mutual interest ami covering virtually all of central appalachia 
we acquired over  acres during and now control over  acres of cbm prospective leasehold within the ami 
by accelerating production from these normally long lived reserves  this drilling technique has resulted in increased projected rates of return on the horizontal cbm wells drilled through this technique was used to drill and complete gross net horizontal cbm wells during  and our horizontal cbm production increased to bcfe in from bcfe in in  our capital budget includes million to drill gross net horizontal cbm wells in appalachia and million for lease acquisitions and pipeline infrastructure 
during  a horizontal well was drilled in the devonian shale and is currently under evaluation 
in  we drilled wells as part of a conventional cbm pilot project in the cherokee basin of southeastern kansas  where we control over  acres 
after performing production testing for a over a year  we evaluated the project to be non commercial  resulting in a charge to exploration expense in the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
early in  we entered into a joint venture with gmx resources  inc 
nasdaq gmxr 
to drill development wells in the north carthage field in east texas 
the wells are drilled and completed in the cotton valley formation with the travis peak and petit formations also present in some wells 
through the joint venture  we have drilling rights on approximately  acres 
we estimate that to wells could ultimately be drilled on this acreage 
outside the joint venture area  we have acquired an additional  acres also prospective in the cotton valley formation 
in our cotton valley play in east texas and north louisiana  which includes the gmx joint venture  gross net wells were drilled during with percent success 
net cotton valley production for the year was bcfe  up from the bcfe produced in from operations preceding our gmx joint venture 
we have continued to expand our leasehold position in the cotton valley play in east texas  and we plan to begin drilling on the new acreage in the second half of the budget includes approximately million to drill gross net wells in east texas and north louisiana 

table of contents another of our important development areas is the selma chalk formation in mississippi 
during  gross net selma chalk wells were drilled and all of the wells were successful 
production from this play was bcfe in  up percent from bcfe in our budget includes approximately million to drill gross net wells in during  we used our gulf coast seismic data base  which now exceeds  square miles  to continue to increase our inventory of internally generated exploration prospects in both south louisiana and south texas 
during  we drilled gross net exploratory wells in the gulf coast region 
of the wells  six were successful  with three located in south louisiana and three in south texas 
in st 
mary parish of south louisiana  we participated in the successful drilling of our first prospect identified with a square mile proprietary d seismic program that was shot in the well  in which we have a percent working interest  was drilled to a total depth of approximately  feet and found productive sands in two different intervals 
fourteen additional prospects have been identified within this d seismic survey  two of which are expected to be drilled in after drilling a successful exploratory well and a development well in the creole area in cameron parish in  an additional exploratory well was drilled in which was a dry hole  and another exploratory well was drilling at year end the creole area  in which we have a percent working interest  is expected to continue to be an active area for us in  with three exploratory wells planned 
since commencing its south louisiana exploratory drilling efforts in  we have drilled eight successful exploratory wells in attempts 
in south texas  a successful vicksburg exploratory well in which we have a percent working interest was drilled in the kingsville field in kleberg county 
in the esperanza project area in nueces county  where we have a percent working interest  two dry vicksburg wells and one dry frio well were drilled 
the vicksburg prospects were higher risk  high potential projects 
we participated with a percent working interest in a successful frio exploratory well in hidalgo county 
our board of directors has approved a oil and gas capital expenditures budget of million 
we do not budget major acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
based on nymex prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of oil  we expect to fund this capital budget using internally generated cash flows from oil and gas production  supplemented by borrowings under our credit facility as needed 
our credit facility consists of a million commitment which  as of january   had outstanding borrowings of million 
additionally  to provide greater certainty of having sufficient operating cash flows to fund our oil and gas capital expenditures program  we have an active commodity price hedging program 
as of january   we had natural gas hedges in place for covering approximately  mmbtu per day 
these positions  primarily in the form of costless collars  provide average floor and ceiling prices of and per mmbtu  respectively  and cover approximately one third of our expected natural gas production 
we also have approximately  mmbtu per day of natural gas hedged for the first half of at average floor and ceiling prices of and respectively 
oil production comprises an insignificant part of our expected production  and no oil production was hedged as of january  performance coal royalty and land management segment pvr pvr s coal royalty revenues increased percent from million in to million in this increase was a result of an increase in coal production of million tons  or percent  combined with a percent increase in average gross royalties per ton from in to in this production increase was primarily related to a longwall mining operation started by one of pvr s lessees in the first quarter of on pvr s coal river property 
this longwall operation increased production by million tons and added million in revenues in the addition of a mine operator and a new mine by another coal river lessee contributed approximately million tons of coal production  or million of revenue 
increased demand also fueled a coal sales price increase in the region  which in turn resulted in a seven percent increase in average gross royalty per ton on the coal river property  from per ton in to per ton in revenues at the wise property increased by million primarily as a result of a percent increase in the average royalty rate from per ton in to per ton in revenues from the spruce laurel property increased by million  primarily as the result of a percent increase in the average gross royalty per ton on the spruce laurel property  from per ton in to per ton in 
table of contents as part of pvr s coal land management business  pvr owns approximately million board feet of standing timber 
pvr generally sells cutting rights to various contractors who cut in advance of a mining project 
timber revenues in were million  down from million in coal prices  especially in central appalachia where the majority of pvr s production is located  have increased significantly since the beginning of the price increase stems from several causes including increased electricity demand and decreasing coal production in central appalachia 
pvr also collects fees and railroad rebates related to its ownership of the coal preparation plant and coal loading facility on the west coal river property 
this new facility and several smaller modular coal preparation plants resulted in additional coal services revenues  supplementing revenues from the shober loading facility  opened in  in virginia 
pvr also spent approximately million to construct a third large scale coal loading facility on its coal river property  and the facility began operating in february coal services revenues increased to million in from million in  and are expected to increase to over million in pvr believes that these types of fee based infrastructure assets provide good investment and cash flow opportunities for the partnership  and it continues to look for additional investments of this type as well as other primarily fee based assets  including oil and gas midstream assets 
the partnership was able to take advantage of another growth opportunity in by acquiring from affiliates of massey energy company for million a percent interest in a joint venture formed to own and operate end user coal handling facilities 
this joint venture is pursuing additional projects to build and operate coal handing facilities for industrial customers 
in march  pvr purchased a natural gas gathering and processing business from cantera for million cash 
these midstream assets include approximately  miles of gas gathering pipelines that supply three natural gas processing facilities which have million cubic feet per day mmcfd of total capacity 
the assets derive revenue primarily from the sharing of proceeds on the sale of natural gas and natural gas liquids under contracts with natural gas producers and from fees charged for gathering and processing of natural gas and other related services 
the assets are located in four geographic regions the oklahoma and texas panhandles  north central oklahoma  north central texas and the arkoma basin 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires the management of the company to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions 
it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments 
we consider the following to be the most critical accounting policies which involve the judgment of our management 
reserves the estimates of oil and gas reserves are the single most critical estimate included in our financial statements 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserve quantities including projecting the total quantities in place  future production rates and the timing of future development expenditures 
in addition  reserve estimates of new discoveries are less precise than those of producing properties due to the lack of a production history 
accordingly  these estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  condensate and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at the end of the respective years 
proved developed reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves are those quantities that require additional capital investment through drilling or well recompletion techniques 
reserve estimates become the basis for determining depletive write off rates  recoverability of historical cost investments  and the fair value of properties subject to potential impairments 

table of contents there are several factors which could change our estimates of oil and gas reserves 
significantly higher or lower product prices could lead to changes in the amount of reserves due to economic limits 
an additional factor that could result in a change of recorded reserves is the reservoir decline rates differing from those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded 
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond our control  such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs 
additionally  we perform impairment tests pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
when significant events occur  such as a market move to a lower price environment or a material revision to our reserve estimates 
we have recognized non cash pretax charges of million  million and million for  and  respectively  related to the impairment of oil and gas properties 
depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved recoverable reserves 
oil and gas properties we use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  costs of acquiring properties  costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration costs  geological  geophysical and seismic costs and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas reporting companies  costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized and later charged to expense if upon determination the wells do not justify commercial development 
occasionally  an exploratory well may be determined to have found oil and gas reserves  but classification of those reserves as proved cannot be made when drilling is completed 
if classification of proved reserves cannot be made in an area requiring a major capital expenditure  the cost of drilling the exploratory well is carried as an asset provided that a there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and b further well completion work needs to be performed or additional exploratory wells need to be drilled and those activities are either underway or firmly planned for the near future 
if either of these two criteria is not met  exploratory well costs are expensed 
for all other exploratory wells  costs of exploratory wells are expensed if the reserves cannot be classified as proved after one year following the completion of drilling 
a portion of the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties 
at december   the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately million 
these costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted 
as exploration work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven  capitalized costs of the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the exploration work is unsuccessful  the capitalized costs of the properties related to the unsuccessful work will be expensed 
the timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties  if warranted  depends upon the nature  timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results 
asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 we make estimates of the timing and future costs of plugging and abandoning wells 
estimated abandonment dates will be revised in the future based on changes to related economic lives  which vary with product prices and production costs 
estimated plugging costs may also be adjusted to reflect changing industry experience 
increases in operating costs and decreases in product prices would increase the estimated amount of our plugging and abandonment obligations and increase depletion expense 
our cash flows would not be affected until costs to plug and abandon were actually incurred 
oil and gas revenues oil and gas sales revenues are recognized when crude oil and natural gas volumes are produced and sold for our account 
as a result of the numerous requirements necessary to gather information from purchasers or various measurement locations  calculate volumes produced  perform field and wellhead allocations and distribute and disburse funds to various working interest partners and royalty owners  the collection of revenues from oil and gas production may take up to days following the month of production 
therefore  accruals for revenues and accounts receivable are made based on estimates of our share of production  particularly from properties that are operated by 
table of contents our partners 
since the settlement process may take to days following the month of actual production  our financial results will include estimates of production and revenues for the related time period 
any differences between the actual amounts ultimately received and the original estimates are recorded in the period they become finalized 
hedging activities we enter into derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
hedge accounting affects the timing of revenue recognition in our statements of income  as a majority of the gain or loss from a contract qualifying as a cash flow hedge is deferred as to statement of income recognition 
the position reflected in the statement of income is based on the actual settlements with the counterparty 
we include this gain or loss in oil and gas revenues 
if our natural gas and crude oil derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting or we chose not to use this hedge accounting methodology  we could experience significant changes in the estimate of non cash derivative gain or loss recognized in revenue due to swings in the value of these contracts 
these fluctuations could be especially significant in a volatile pricing environment 
coal royalties coal royalty revenues are recognized on the basis of tons of coal sold by the partnership s lessees and the corresponding revenues from those sales 
since pvr does not operate any mines  it does not have access to actual production and revenue information until approximately days following the month of production 
therefore  the financial results of the partnership include estimated revenues and accounts receivable for this day period 
any differences between the actual amounts ultimately received and the original estimates are recorded in the period they become finalized 
acquisitions oil and gas on january   we acquired a percent non operating working interest in properties located in a producing field in south texas the south texas acquisition 
the properties were acquired in a cash transaction with a private investor group for million 
the acquisition  which was effective december   was financed with the company s existing credit facility 
nine producing wells were acquired at the time of the acquisition 
ten successful development wells and one development dry hole have been drilled in the field since the acquisition date 
coal royalty and land management midstream oil and gas 
in march  pvr purchased from cantera a natural gas gathering and processing business with assets in oklahoma and texas for million of cash the cantera acquisition 
as a result of this acquisition  pvr now owns and operates a business  under the name pvr midstream llc  consisting of a set of midstream assets that include approximately  miles of gas gathering pipelines that supply three natural gas processing facilities with mmcfd of total capacity 
pvr will derive revenues from this business primarily from the sharing of sales proceeds of natural gas and natural gas liquids under contracts with natural gas producers and from fees charged for the gathering and processing of natural gas and other related services 
these midstream assets are located in four geographic regions the oklahoma and texas panhandles  north central oklahoma  north central texas and the arkoma basin 
concurrent with the closing of the cantera acquisition  the partnership completed an expanded five year credit facility led by pnc capital markets and rbc capital markets  consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
pvr used the term loan and a portion of the revolving credit facility to fund the cantera acquisition 
the new revolving credit facility was also used to pay off pvr s existing revolver which had an outstanding balance of million at december  the partnership anticipates using a combination of its credit facility and new equity capital to permanently finance this acquisition 
as of december   the partnership capitalized million for costs related to the cantera acquisition 
in order to protect the projected cash flows of the acquisition from the risk of commodity price volatility  in january  pvr entered into notional derivative contracts for approximately percent of the net volume of 
table of contents natural gas liquids expected to be sold from april through december the underlying commodity prices that pvr expects to realize in future periods  after giving effect to the derivative contracts  are expected to exceed the commodity prices used in financial evaluation of the acquisition 
since the time pvr entered into the derivative contracts  futures prices of natural gas liquids have increased significantly 
as of march   the aggregate fair value of these derivative contracts was unfavorable to pvr 
upon closing of the cantera acquisition and documenting hedge effectiveness  these derivative contracts are expected to qualify as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 

see our previous discussion of hedging activities in critical accounting policies and estimates 
from the time the derivative contracts were executed until completion of the hedge effectiveness documentation  the derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the unfavorable change in the derivative contracts fair value was estimated to be approximately million as of march  the fair value at the date the derivative contracts qualify for hedge accounting will be recognized as a non cash reduction of earnings for pvr in the first quarter of the million as of march   is the most recently available fair value estimate and is subject to change until the derivative contracts qualify for hedge accounting 
all cash settlements of these derivative contracts will be paid or received over the month term of the contracts 
coal handling joint venture 
in july  the partnership acquired from affiliates of massey energy company a percent interest in a joint venture formed to own and operate end user coal handling facilities 
the purchase price was million and was funded through the partnership s credit facility 
the joint venture owns coal handling facilities which unload shipments and store and transfer coal for three industrial coal consumers in the chemical  paper and lime production industries located in tennessee  virginia and kentucky  respectively 
a combination of fixed monthly fees and per ton throughput fees is paid by those consumers under long term leases expiring between and pvr recognized equity earnings of million related to its ownership in the joint venture in the partnership received a joint venture distribution of approximately million during the fourth quarter of relating to third quarter operations 
coal loadout facility 
in january  the partnership completed the construction of a new coal loadout facility for one of its lessees on its coal river property in west virginia 
the million loadout facility is designed for the high speed loading of car unit trains and became operational on february  this facility generated additional revenues of approximately million in  and the partnership believes it resulted in increased coal production of approximately million tons from this lessee during coal reserves 
in december  the partnership acquired the peabody acquisition million tons of proven and probable coal reserves the reserves located in new mexico million tons and west virginia million tons from peabody energy corporation peabody 
all of the reserves were leased back to subsidiaries of peabody by the partnership 
the peabody acquisition provided geographic diversity by exposing pvr to new markets in the western united states and in northern appalachia 
the inclusion of peabody as a significant part of pvr s lessee mix added strength and stability to its lessee group 
the acquisition was funded with million of cash  million of the partnership s common units and million of the partnership s class b common units 
all of the class b common units were converted into common units in accordance with their terms  upon the approval of pvr common unitholders in july in december and january  peabody sold million of its common units in public offerings sponsored by the partnership  and  as of december   peabody held million of pvr s common units 
in august  the partnership purchased approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves located on the upshur properties in northern appalachia for million the upshur acquisition 
the properties  which include approximately  mineral acres  contain predominantly high sulfur  high btu coal reserves

consolidated net income net income for the company totaled million in  an increase of percent over the higher earnings were primarily the result of both increased natural gas and coal production and higher prices for natural gas  crude oil and coal 
oil and gas segment in our oil and gas segment  we explore for  develop and produce crude oil and natural gas in the eastern and gulf coast onshore regions of the united states 
our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  which are affected by numerous factors that are generally beyond the company s control 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
natural gas prices are influenced by national and regional supply and demand 
a substantial or extended decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and cash flow and could  under certain circumstances  result in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
our future profitability and growth is also highly dependent on the results of our exploratory and development drilling programs

coal royalty and land management segment pvr the coal royalty and land management segment includes pvr s coal reserves  its timber assets and its other land assets 
the assets  liabilities and earnings of pvr are fully consolidated in our financial statements  with the public unitholders interest reflected as a minority interest 
the partnership enters into leases with various third party operators for the right to mine coal reserves on the partnership s properties in exchange for royalty payments 
the partnership does not operate any mines 
approximately percent of the partnership s coal royalty revenues and percent of its coal royalty revenues were derived from coal mined on the partnership s properties and sold by its lessees under leases providing for royalty rates per ton leased on the higher of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of coal  with pre established minimum monthly or annual rental payments 
the balance of the partnership s and coal royalty revenues was derived from coal mined on two of the partnership s properties under leases containing fixed royalty rates per ton of coal mined and sold fixed rate leases 
the royalty rates under those leases escalate annually  with pre established minimum monthly payments 
in addition to coal royalty revenues  the partnership generates coal services revenues from fees charged to lessees for the use of coal preparation and transloading facilities 
the partnership also generates revenues from the sale of standing timber on its properties 

table of contents coal royalties are impacted by several factors that pvr generally cannot control 
the number of tons mined annually is determined by an operator s mining efficiency  labor availability  geologic conditions  access to capital  ability to market coal and ability to arrange reliable transportation to the end user 
the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which may have a significant impact on the mining operations of the partnership s lessees or their customers ability to use coal and may require pvr  its lessees or its lessee s customers to change operations significantly or incur substantial costs

the increase in coal royalty and land management segment revenues is primarily related to increased royalties received from pvr s lessees 
coal royalty revenues increased due to increased production by pvr s lessees and higher royalty rates 
the partnership s lessees mined approximately million tons of coal in from pvr s properties and paid an 
table of contents average royalty of per ton  compared with approximately million tons mined in at an average royalty of per ton 
in  approximately million tons of coal were mined on properties with market sensitive leases  with an average royalty rate of per ton  compared with million tons of coal and an average royalty rate of per ton in coal mined from fixed rate leases during totaled million tons at an average royalty rate of per ton  compared with million tons and an average royalty rate of per ton in average gross royalties per ton increased by percent due primarily to stronger market conditions for coal and the resulting higher coal prices 
production increased by percent primarily due to the following factors production on the coal river property increased by million tons  which resulted in an increase in revenues of million 
one lessee  which utilizes longwall mining  began mining on one of pvr s subleased properties from an adjacent property during the first quarter of  which resulted in an additional million tons of coal production  or million in revenues in the addition of a mine operator and a new mine by another lessee contributed approximately million tons of coal production  or million of revenue 
the commencement of operations in july on the west coal river property also contributed an additional million tons  or million of revenue 
increased demand also fueled a coal sales price increase in the region  which in turn resulted in a seven percent increase in the average gross royalty per ton on the coal river property  from per ton in to per ton in production on the wise property increased by million tons and revenues increased by million  of which approximately million related to an increase in the average royalty rate received from pvr s lessees 
increased coal prices fueled by stronger demand in the region resulted in higher price realizations by pvr s lessees 
this caused a percent increase in the average gross royalty per ton from per ton in to per ton in production increased primarily due to four new mines  including one operated by a new lessee  and certain lessees ability to increase operating days in response to higher coal demand 
production on the spruce laurel property increased by million tons  and revenues increased by million 
the revenue increase was primarily the result of increased coal sales prices fueled by stronger demand in the region 
the higher royalty rates received from pvr s lessees resulted in a percent increase in the average gross royalty per ton on the spruce laurel property  from per ton in to per ton in coal services revenues increased primarily as a result of start up operations at pvr s west coal river and bull creek facilities in july and february  respectively 
timber revenues decreased due to the timing of a parcel sale of pvr s standing timber in and poor weather conditions in the second quarter of other revenues decreased due to a reduction in minimum rental revenues  partially offset by equity earnings and a gain on the sale of property 
minimum rental revenues decreased from million in to million in primarily due to the expiration of amounts available for recoupment by pvr s lessees 
the amount recognized in primarily related to four leases 
each of these leases was assigned to a new lessee approved by pvr 
the leases were amended at the time of assignment to allow the new lessees additional time to offset actual production against minimum rental payments 
the partnership recognized equity earnings of million in  representing pvr s portion of earnings from its investment in the coal handling joint venture with massey energy since pvr acquired the equity investment in july a million gain on the sale of surface property in virginia was recognized in other revenues 
operating costs and expenses 
the increase in aggregate operating costs and expenses primarily relates to an increase in operating expenses  general and administrative expenses and dd a  partially offset by a decrease in taxes other than income 
operating expenses include royalty expenses paid on leased coal properties and other operating expenses 
royalty expenses increased by percent to million in from million in due to an increase in production by lessees on pvr s subleased properties  primarily the coal river property 
production from subleased properties doubled to million tons in from million tons in other operating expenses increased due to the assumption by a new lessee of costs incurred after may to maintain idled mines on the west coal river property  which is part of the coal river property 
pvr paid these costs through may 
table of contents the decrease in taxes other than income was attributable to property taxes in resulting from the assumption by a new lessee of the property tax obligation on pvr s west coal river property for which we had been responsible since the bankruptcy of our initial west coal river lessee 
general and administrative expenses increased by million 
approximately million was attributable to costs related to a secondary public offering for the sale of common units held by an affiliate of peabody 
the remainder is primarily attributable to increased professional fees and payroll costs relating to evaluating acquisition opportunities and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of dd a expense increased primarily as a result of increased production and depreciation on the west coal river and bull creek facilities which began start up operations in july and february  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense increased primarily due to bridge loan issue costs that were expensed upon the termination of the bridge loan agreement in december and higher debt levels resulting from the coal handling joint venture investment in july interest income 
interest income decreased primarily due to the declining principal balance on pvr s note receivable

coal royalty revenues increased due to increased production by lessees  partially offset by a decline in royalty rates 
average gross royalties per ton decreased by percent as a result of the lower royalty rates attributable to our leases with peabody 
over the same periods  production increased by million tons  or percent  primarily due to the following factors production on the new mexico property increased by million tons  which resulted in an increase in revenues of million 
the increase was a direct result of the peabody acquisition in december production on the northern appalachia property increased by million tons  which resulted in an increase in revenues of million 
the increase was a direct result of the peabody acquisition in december and the upshur acquisition in august 
table of contents production on the coal river property increased by million tons  which resulted in an increase in revenues of million 
the addition of a mine operator and a new mine by one lessee contributed million tons  or million in revenues 
one lessee mined onto our property from an adjacent property in  which resulted in an additional million tons  or million in revenues 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to one lessee beginning operations in late and reaching full production in and start up operations on the west coal river property 
additional production from two lessees with high royalty rates coupled with increased demand in the region resulted in a percent increase in the average gross royalty per ton on the coal river property from per ton in to per ton in production on the wise property increased by million tons  which resulted in an increase in revenues of million 
the increase was primarily due to additional mining equipment being added by two lessees and another lessee beginning operations in late and reaching full production in production on the spruce laurel property decreased by million tons  which resulted in a decrease in revenues of million 
these decreases were the result of the depletion of two mines in production on the buchanan property decreased by million tons  which resulted in a million decrease in revenues as this property continues to approach the end of its reserve life 
coal services revenues increased as a direct result of pvr s west coal river preparation and transloading facility beginning operations in july and the addition of a small preparation plant 
timber revenues decreased due to a decreased volume and sales price 
the decrease in volume sold was due to the timing of parcel sales 
other revenues decreased by million 
the decrease was primarily due to reduction of minimum rental revenues 
the decrease in minimum rental revenues was due to a lessee rejecting pvr s lease in bankruptcy in  consequently  million of deferred revenues from this respective lessee was recognized as income in the remainder of the decrease in minimum rental revenues was primarily due to the timing of expiring recoupment from pvr s lessees 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  which include both lease operating expenses and taxes other than income  increased primarily due to an increase in lease operating expenses  which were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to maintenance costs for idled mines on the west coal river property 
pvr leased its west coal river property in may  and the on going maintenance costs were assumed by the new lessee as of that date 
the remainder of the variance is primarily attributable to increased production by lessees on subleased properties 
aggregate production from subleased properties increased to million tons for the year ended december   from million tons for the year ended december  the increase in taxes other than income was attributable to higher property taxes as a result of our assumption of the property tax obligation on the west coal river property when we took back our lease on this property from the bankrupt lessee 
pvr leased the west coal river property in may  and the on going property taxes were assumed by the new lessee as of that date 
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased payroll  an increase in insurance premiums  additional recurring expenses associated with the peabody acquisition and costs related to the secondary offering of units for peabody 
dd a expense increased as a result of higher depletion rates caused by higher cost bases relative to reserves added as well as increased production  both of which related primarily to the peabody and upshur acquisitions completed in the last half of interest expense

we used cash in excess of working capital needs during both years to help fund the respective year s capital expenditures 
cash provided by operations of the coal royalty and land management segment increased primarily due to increased production attributable to a longwall mining operation located on one of pvr s properties  coupled with an increase in average royalties per ton resulting from higher coal sales prices

we are committed to expanding our oil and natural gas operations over the next several years through a combination of exploration  development and acquisition of new properties 
we have a portfolio of assets which balances relatively low risk  moderate return development projects in appalachia and mississippi with relatively moderate risk  potentially higher return development projects and exploration prospects in south texas and south louisiana 
we estimate oil and gas segment capital expenditures for to be approximately million 
we expect to use approximately million of the planned oil and gas capital expenditures for development drilling projects  including horizontal cbm and conventional drilling in appalachia  our mississippi selma chalk assets and drilling cotton valley wells in east texas and north louisiana 
we expect to use approximately million of the planned expenditures on exploration drilling  concentrated primarily in south louisiana and south texas 
we expect to use approximately million to build our library of d seismic data and approximately million for lease acquisition and field project expenditures 
we continually review drilling and other capital expenditure plans and may change these amounts based on industry conditions and the availability of capital 
we believe our cash flow from operations and sources of debt financing are sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures program 
during the first quarter of  pvr made capital expenditures of approximately million  plus closing fees and adjustments  for the cantera acquisition 
the acquisition was funded with a new million credit facility as described in the following section  cash flows from financing activities

the term loan and a portion of the revolving credit facility were used to fund the cantera acquisition and to repay borrowings under the pvr revolver 
the new revolving credit facility is available for general partnership purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions  and includes a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
pvr has a one time option under the revolving credit facility to increase the facility by up to million upon receipt by the lenders administrative agent of commitments from one or more existing or new lenders 
once repaid  the term loan cannot be re borrowed

the pvr notes bore interest at a fixed rate of percent and mature over a ten year period ending in march  with semi annual interest payments through march followed by semi annual principal and interest payments beginning in september at december   pvr was in compliance with the covenants in the notes 
in november  pvr s investment grade debt rating of bbb low was confirmed by dominion bond rating services  an accredited bond rating agency 
concurrent with the closing of the cantera acquistion  pvr amended the notes to allow pvr to enter the midstream natural gas business and to increase certain covenant coverage ratios  including the ratio of pvr s consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as defined in the notes 
in exchange for this amendment  pvr agreed to a percent increase in the fixed interest rate on the notes  from percent to percent 
the amendment to the notes also requires that pvr obtain an annual confirmation of its credit rating  with a percent increase in the interest rate payable on the notes in the event pvr s credit rating falls below investment grade 
in conjunction with the pvr notes  the partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  to hedge a portion of the fair value of the pvr notes 
this swap is designated as a fair value hedge and has been reflected as a decrease in long term debt of million as of december   with a

under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  the counterparty pays the partnership a fixed annual rate of percent on a total notional amount of million  and the partnership pays the counterparty a variable rate equal to the floating interest rate which is determined semi annually and is based on the six month london interbank offering rate plus percent 
future capital needs and commitments 
in  we anticipate making total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of approximately million 
nearly all of these expenditures are expected to be made in our oil and gas segment  and are expected to be funded primarily by operating cash flow 
additional funding will be provided as needed from our revolver  under which we had million of borrowing capacity as of december  in connection with pvr s cantera acquisition  during the fourth quarter of  the partnership entered into a bridge loan commitment with two financial institutions 
the bridge loan was terminated late in the fourth quarter of  and pvr replaced it with an expanded credit facility concurrent with the closing of the cantera acquisition 
pvr anticipates using a combination its credit facility and new equity capital to permanently finance the cantera acquisition 
the partnership also anticipates capital expenditures of million for coal services related projects and other property and equipment  which it believes can be funded with cash flow provided by operating activities 
limitations in the availability of debt financing may necessitate the issuance of new units  as opposed to using debt  to provide a large part of the funding for acquisitions in the future 
our contractual cash obligations as of december   were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years thereafter in thousands penn virginia corporation revolver pvr revolver pvr notes rental commitments firm transportation agreements total contractual cash obligations rental commitments primarily relate to equipment and building leases 
also included are pvr s rental commitments  which primarily relate to reserve based properties which are  or are intended to be  subleased by the partnership to third parties 
the obligation expires when the property has been mined to exhaustion or the lease has been canceled 
the timing of mining by third party operators is difficult to estimate due to numerous factors 
we believe the obligation after five years cannot be reasonably estimated  however  based on current knowledge  we believe pvr will incur approximately million in rental commitments in perpetuity until the reserves have been exhausted 
environmental matters our businesses are subject to various environmental hazards 
numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and rules govern the environmental aspects of our businesses 
noncompliance with these laws  regulations and rules can result in substantial penalties or other liabilities 
we do not believe our environmental risks are materially different from those of comparable companies or that cost of compliance will have a material adverse effect on our profitability  capital expenditures  cash flows or competitive position 
however  there is no assurance that future changes in or additions to laws  regulations or rules regarding the protection of the environment will not have such an impact 
we believe we are materially in compliance with environmental laws  regulations and rules

lessees post performance bonds pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing  including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  under which pvr classified leased coal mineral rights as intangible assets 
in april  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp that amends certain sections of sfas no 
and no 
relating to the characterization of coal mineral rights 
as allowed by the fsp  the partnership early adopted the fsp in april and  accordingly  reclassified its leased coal mineral rights back to tangible property 
the partnership discontinued straight line amortization upon adoption and will deplete its coal mineral rights using the units of production method on a prospective basis 
the amount capitalized related to a mineral right represents its fair value at the time such right was acquired  less accumulated amortization 
pursuant to the fsp  for comparative presentation purposes  million was reclassified from a separate line item in other noncurrent assets to net property and equipment as of december   on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in september  the fasb issued another fsp to clarify that the scope exception in paragraph b of sfas no 
includes the balance sheet classification and disclosures for drilling and mineral rights of oil and gas producing companies 
therefore  our historical practice of including the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties under sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  has been affirmed by the new fsp 
the fasb issued fsp sfas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  in may  effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the fsp requires employers that qualify for a prescription drug subsidy under medicare legislation enacted in december to recognize the reduction in costs as employees provide services in future years 
we adopted fsp sfas on july   and it did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of january   decreased by million 
in december  the fasb issued a revised version of sfas no 
 share based payment  which requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
sfas no 
will be effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  at that time  we will be required to begin recognizing compensation expense for the unvested portion of outstanding options 
we are currently assessing the effect of the revised sfas no 
on our financial statements 
sfas no 
 exchanges of productive assets  was also issued in december and requires that nonmonetary exchanges of assets be accounted for at fair value  recognizing any gain or loss  subject to certain criteria 
before this new rule  companies were permitted to account for nonmonetary exchanges at book value 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  this new pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements

many of such factors are beyond our ability to control or predict 
readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward looking statements

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of long term debt borrowed against our revolver 
the revolver matures in december and is governed by a borrowing base calculation that is re determined semi annually 
we have the option to elect interest at i libor plus a eurodollar margin ranging from to percent  based on the percentage of the borrowing base outstanding or ii the greater of the prime rate or federal funds rate plus a margin ranging from to percent 
as a result  our interest costs will fluctuate based on short term interest rates relating to the pva revolver 
as of december   million of pvr s borrowings were financed with debt which has a fixed interest rate throughout its term 
in connection with this financing  pvr executed an interest rate derivative transaction to effectively convert the interest rate on one third of the amount financed from a fixed rate of percent to a floating rate of libor plus percent 
the interest rate swap has been accounted for as a fair value hedge in compliance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
price risk management 
our price risk management program permits the utilization of derivative financial instruments such as futures  forwards  option contracts and swaps to mitigate the price risks associated with fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices as they relate to our anticipated production 
these financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
the derivative financial instruments are placed with major financial institutions that we believe are of minimum credit risk 
the fair value of our price risk management assets are significantly affected by energy price fluctuations 
see the discussion and tables in note  hedging activities of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our hedging program and a listing of open hedging contracts and their fair value 
in connection with the cantera acquisition  pvr entered into notional derivative contracts in january for approximately percent of the net volume of natural gas liquids expected to be sold from april through december the underlying commodity prices that pvr expects to realize in future periods  after giving effect to the derivative contracts  are expected to exceed the commodity prices used in financial evaluation of the acquisition 
since the time pvr entered into the derivative contracts  futures prices of natural gas liquids have increased significantly 
as of march   the aggregate fair value of these derivative contracts was unfavorable to pvr 
upon closing of the cantera acquisition and documenting hedge effectiveness  these derivative contracts are expected to qualify as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 

see our previous discussion of hedging activities in critical accounting policies and estimates 
from the time the derivative contracts were executed until completion of the 
table of contents hedge effectiveness documentation  the derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the unfavorable change in the derivative contracts fair value was estimated to be approximately million as of march  the fair value at the date the derivative contracts qualify for hedge accounting will be recognized as a non cash reduction of earnings for pvr in the first quarter of the million as of march   is the most recently available fair value estimate and is subject to change until the derivative contracts qualify for hedge accounting 
all cash settlements of these derivative contracts will be paid or received over the month term of the contracts
