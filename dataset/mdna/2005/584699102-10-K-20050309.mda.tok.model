introduction medimmune is committed to advancing science to develop better medicines that help people live healthier  longer and more satisfying lives 
medimmune currently focuses its efforts on using biotechnology to produce innovative products for prevention and treatment in the therapeutic areas of infectious disease  autoimmune disease and cancer 
medimmune s scientific expertise is largely in the areas of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines 
medimmune markets four products  synagis  flumist  ethyol and cytogam and has a diverse pipeline of development stage products 
in january  we acquired aviron  a california based vaccine company the acquisition 
overview during  product sales surpassed billion for the first time in corporate history  increasing as compared to  reflecting growth in synagis sales and recognition of flumist product sales revenues related to the and flu seasons 
we recorded a net loss of per share in compared to diluted net earnings per share of in the decline in net income was primarily attributable to charges incurred in for the reacquisition of the influenza vaccines franchise from wyeth  and increased research and development spending due to higher levels of clinical activity 
our earnings also included milestones and other payments we received from wyeth for fda approval of flumist and achievement of other goals totaling million 
following the disappointing launch of flumist in  we completed a thorough assessment of the approved product  flumist  the live attenuated  nasally delivered influenza technology and subsequent products collectively  the influenza vaccines franchise  and the influenza market 
based on this assessment  we maintain our belief that flumist is a significant advance in the prevention of influenza disease  and reiterated our commitment to the future of vaccine and related technology 
notwithstanding this commitment  we do not expect the vaccine to be a meaningful contributor to revenue growth before  when we hope to launch caiv t  the refrigerator stable version of flumist  in the united states 
from to  we expect to focus our efforts on developing flumist into a superior influenza vaccine preferred by pediatricians  with particular attention toward developing caiv t now in phase development and seeking approval to extend the indicated population to include individuals below the age of five years and above the age of years 
toward this goal  in april  we entered into agreements with wyeth to dissolve our collaboration for the influenza vaccines franchise 
as a result of the dissolution and in exchange for an upfront fee  future milestones and royalties  we reacquired the full rights to this technology 
we also assumed full responsibility for the manufacturing  marketing  and selling of flumist and any subsequent related products 
during  we substantially completed the transition of all research  development  clinical  regulatory  and sales and marketing activities related to the influenza vaccines franchise from wyeth to us 
for the flu season  we introduced a substantially lower price structure for flumist and refocused our selling efforts on the same pediatricians who are our synagis customers 
in early october  regulatory actions in the united kingdom caused a significant portion of the injectable influenza vaccine supply for the us to be withheld from the market 
subsequently  we increased the quantity of filled flumist doses for the season to approximately three million  of which approximately million doses were sold through december  we continued developing our product candidates during with the advancement of three programs into phase development  including numax  caiv t  and our human papillomavirus vaccine partnered with gsk 
we continued to advance our oncology program for vitaxin  with phase trials currently being conducted in melanoma and prostate cancer 
during  we decided to terminate phase testing of vitaxin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis  based on preliminary data suggesting lack of clinical benefit in these inflammatory diseases 
we also received approval for a supplemental biologics license application for a liquid formulation of synagis in july as we look to the future  we intend to continue commercializing our core products  advance our product candidates in the clinic  and develop our pipeline through our own internal discovery and development efforts and by gaining access to new technologies through acquisition and in licensing arrangements 
our product development objectives include targeting a total of eight new inds by the end of we anticipate that we will have four product candidates in phase studies by the end of  and will be attempting to introduce at least three new products to market by our cash and marketable securities at december  were billion as compared to billion at december  in addition to our research and development activities  we utilized cash during for two significant transactions the redemption and payment of the remaining convertible subordinated notes and the payments associated with the reacquisition and transition of the influenza vaccines franchise from wyeth 
we have the following expectations for product sales for  we expect product sales to grow by approximately percent  driven by worldwide reported revenues from synagis that are expected to top the billion mark for the first time 
we expect that the product mix on a percentage basis in will be comparable to that in owing to the fact that for the foreseeable future synagis is expected to continue to comprise a majority of our product sales  we believe our revenues and operating results will reflect the seasonality of that product s use to prevent rsv disease  which occurs primarily during the winter months 
as noted above  we do not expect flumist to be a meaningful contributor to revenue growth before  when we hope to launch in the united states an improved formulation of this influenza vaccine with a label including a broader age indication 
as such  we expect only a modest increase in sales of flumist in compared to gross margin excluding gross margins on flumist  we expect that our annual gross margin percentage for will be consistent with our historical rate 
we anticipate that flumist will continue to exert downward pressure on gross margins until we successfully launch an improved formulation with a broader label 
we expect that gross margins may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  based on the product mix and reflecting the seasonality of synagis and flumist 
research and development expense we expect research and development expenses to increase in compared to  and comprise approximately to percent of product sales 
this is largely due to the initiation of several phase trials for numax and caiv t during the fourth quarter of  which will continue throughout throughout  we believe our financial position will remain strong with cash flow from operations funding capital expansion  strategic investments  research and development expenditures  and repurchases of common stock 
dissolution of the collaboration with wyeth in april  we entered into agreements to dissolve the collaboration with wyeth for flumist  caiv t and all related technology 
as a result of the dissolution and in exchange for an upfront fee and future milestones and sales related royalties  medimmune reacquired the influenza vaccines franchise  and assumed full responsibility for the manufacturing  marketing and sale of flumist and any subsequent related product 
as part of the dissolution  we acquired wyeth s distribution facility in louisville  kentucky 
wyeth has provided bulk manufacturing materials  transferred clinical trial data  as well as provided manufacturing support services  during a transition that was substantially completed during in connection with the dissolution of the collaboration  we made payments during totaling million under the terms of the agreement  representing the final reconciliation of the amounts owed between parties related to the influenza season  the settlement of commercialization and development expenses owed between parties through the date of the agreement  the purchase of the distribution center  the transfer of other assets from wyeth  and the payment of milestones for achieving certain goals for transition activities 
an additional million due to wyeth as of december  for technology transfer and transition activities is included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet 
the notable impacts of the transaction during are as follows revenue beginning with the flu season and beyond  all flumist product sales are recorded as the sales price to our distributor less customary sales allowances 
we no longer receive any reimbursement from wyeth for development and commercialization costs  nor do we receive milestone payments 
research and development our research and development charges increased significantly in compared to as we completed the transition of research and development activities from wyeth and increased our resources and infrastructure to assume full responsibility for the continued development and regulatory approval of the influenza vaccine franchise 
impairment of intangible asset in conjunction with the acquisition in  we recorded an intangible asset on our balance sheet that represented the fair value  as determined by an independent valuation  of the original collaborative agreement with wyeth for the development  manufacture  distribution  marketing  promotion and sale of flumist 
as a result of the dissolution of our original collaboration with wyeth  we recorded a permanent impairment charge of million during the second quarter of to write off the remaining unamortized cost of the intangible asset 
acquired in process research and development ipr d we recorded charges for ipr d of million during  representing the relative fair value of purchased in process technologies at the purchase date  as determined by an independent valuation 
a portion of the charges that occurred in relate to milestone payments to wyeth for the achievement of certain contractual deliverables 
see further explanation of the calculation of the ipr d charge in the critical accounting estimates section 
income taxes our effective tax rate for was approximately  as compared to our effective rate of approximately  reflecting the impact of the portion of ipr d expensed during the second quarter that is not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the impact of the dissolution of the wyeth agreements  the effective tax rate was approximately 
see further discussion of income taxes in the critical accounting estimates section 
new accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
we have adopted fin no 
and determined that we do not currently hold interests in any entities that are subject to the consolidation provisions of this interpretation 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires public companies to recognize expense associated with share based compensation arrangements  including employee stock options  using a fair value based option pricing model  and eliminates the alternative to use accounting principles board opinion s intrinsic value method of accounting for share based payments 
in accordance with the new pronouncement  we plan to begin recognizing the expense associated with share based payments  as determined using a fair value based method  in our statements of operations beginning on july  we expect that adoption of the expense provisions of the statement will have a material impact on our results of operations 
the standard allows three alternative transition methods for public companies modified prospective application without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption  modified retrospective application with restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption  and modified retrospective application with restatement of prior financial statements to include the same amounts that were previously included in pro forma disclosures 
we have not determined which transition method we will adopt 
during july  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock 
eitf requires investors to apply the equity method of accounting to investments that are in substance common stock  defined as an investment in an entity that has risk and reward characteristics that are substantially similar to the entity s common stock 
the eitf is effective for reporting periods beginning after september  during the third quarter of  we early adopted eitf  with an immaterial impact to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
during september  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
eitf requires that all contingently convertible debt instruments be included in diluted earnings per share using the if converted method  regardless if the market price trigger or other contingent feature has been met 
the eitf is effective for reporting periods ending after december  and requires that prior period earnings per share amounts presented for comparative purposes be restated 
under the provisions of eitf  our convertible senior notes the notes  which represent million potential shares of common stock  will be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share using the if converted method regardless if the contingent requirements have been met for conversion to common stock 
we adopted eitf during the fourth quarter of  and determined that there is not a material impact on prior periods earnings per share calculations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter to require that idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we will adopt sfas for inventory costs incurred beginning january  as required by the standard 
we expect that adoption of the standard will have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates have the greatest impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development of and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in process research and development when we enter into significant agreements for access to late stage technology or product candidates  we generally perform a valuation of the transaction to determine the fair value of the acquired in process technologies at the acquisition date  calculated as the sum of probability adjusted commercial scenarios  or income approach 
this method is usually based upon management s estimates of the probability of fda and or other regulatory body approval and commercial success for the product candidate  which can include the estimated impact of key factors  including the size of the indicated population  price  volume  timing of regulatory approval and any potential failure to commercialize the product 
during  we recorded a charge of million for acquired ipr d in conjunction with our reacquisition of influenza vaccine franchise rights from wyeth in may the charge represents the estimated relative fair value  as of the purchase date  of the acquired in process technologies and certain ipr d projects  primarily caiv t  calculated utilizing the income approach 
caiv t is not expected to have the logistical and distribution issues associated with the frozen formulation and is expected to have an expanded label 
we do not believe that there will be any alternative future use for the in process technologies that were expensed as of the reacquisition date 
in valuing the purchased in process technologies  we estimated cash inflows based on extensive market research performed on the us marketplace and cash outflows for product costs  milestones and royalties to be paid over a year period assuming approval and us launch in the timeframe using probability of success adjusted scenarios and a discount rate of 
based on current information  management believes that the projections underlying the analysis are reasonable  however  the actual cash inflows or outflows cannot be predicted with certainty 
to achieve these projections  we are required to complete certain phase clinical trials over the next several years 
the estimated total cost of these worldwide phase clinical trials  which is dependent upon several factors including the ultimate design of the trials  the number of patients to be enrolled  and the number of sites needed to complete enrollment  is estimated to range between million and million 
as with all biotechnology products  the probability of commercial success for any one research and development project is highly uncertain 
if we fail to successfully complete the clinical trials or if caiv t is not approved by the fda as a safe and effective vaccine for our targeted populations  the launch may be delayed or terminated  resulting in a diminished or no return on the purchase price of the acquisition  payments made to wyeth in connection with dissolution of the collaboration and development costs incurred to date 
in addition  as of december   none of the existing manufacturing facilities involved in the production of caiv t have been licensed to manufacture caiv t by any regulatory agency  nor has caiv t been manufactured on a sustained commercial scale 
there can be no assurance that these facilities can achieve licensure by the fda or any other regulatory agency  nor can there be any assurances that if licensed  commercial scale production could be achieved or sustained 
if we fail to obtain fda approval for the marketing and manufacture of caiv t  we will not achieve the currently anticipated return on any investment we have made or will make in caiv t 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of  million for acquired ipr d in conjunction with the acquisition 
flumist  the leading product candidate at the time  was considered to be a late stage product candidate  and as such  we used the methodology described above to value the amount of the purchased ipr d at the transaction date 
flumist was approved in june and launched in september as a result of multiple factors  which were unforeseen at the time of the acquisition  flumist did not achieve the level of initial commercial success that we had projected for the first season 
after a thorough analysis of the product subsequent to the first season  we are focused on attempting to change the formulation from frozen to refrigerator stable and to expand the label to months through years of age 
as such  we do not presently believe that the flumist product will be a meaningful contributor to revenue growth before  when we hope to launch caiv t 
had we known at the time of the acquisition that we would have a more narrow indication the june approval was for healthy people from years to years of age than expected or that our sales volumes would be much lower than expected  the value assigned to the purchased ipr d would likely have been approximately half of the original valuation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we receive royalties from licensees  based on third party sales of licensed products or technologies 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product is recognized ratably over the development or supply period 
we may record deferred revenues related to milestone payments and other up front payments 
deferred revenue for manufacturing obligations is recognized as product is delivered 
deferred revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements  as long as the milestones are substantive and at risk 
revenue under research and development cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
inventory we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
we could be required to permanently write down previously capitalized costs related to pre approval or pre launch inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in commercialization  or other potential factors 
conversely  our gross margins may be favorably impacted if some or all of the inventory previously written down becomes available and is used for commercial sale 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with marketed products based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
we could be required to permanently write down previously capitalized costs related to commercial inventory due to quality issues or other potential factors 
conversely  our gross margins may be favorably impacted if some or all of the inventory previously written down is recovered through further processing or receipt of specification waiver from regulatory agencies  and becomes available and is used for commercial sale 
we are required to state all inventory at lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to multiple factors affecting our inventories and compare these with current or committed inventory levels 
in the highly regulated industry in which we operate  raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories have expiration dates that must be factored into our judgments about the recoverability of inventory costs 
additionally  if our estimate of a product s pricing is such that we may not fully recover the cost of inventory  we must consider that in our judgments as well 
in the context of reflecting inventory at the lower of cost or market  we will record permanent inventory write downs as soon as a need for such a write down is determined 
such write downs in inventory are permanent in nature  and will not be reversed in future periods 
the valuation of flumist inventories continues to require a significant amount of judgment for multiple reasons 
specifically  the manufacturing process is complex  in part due to the required annual update of the formulation for recommended influenza strains  and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to continue to successfully manufacture the product 
prior to approval in june  all flumist inventories were considered pre approval and pre launch inventories 
subsequent to approval  all flumist inventories were considered to be inventory available for commercial sale 
the annual flumist production cycle begins in october of the year prior to the influenza season in which the product will be consumed 
for example  the production cycle for the season began in october the production cycle begins by preparing the master viral working seeds and readying the manufacturing facilities for the bulk monovalent production  blending three monovalent strains into a trivalent vaccine  filling into intranasal sprayers  packaging sprayers into multi dose packs and distributing the frozen product 
our raw materials have expiration dates dates by which they must be used in the production process that range from months to months 
our semi processed raw materials and work in process inventory have multiple components  each having different expiration dates that range from nine to months 
each season s finished flumist product has an approved shelf life ranging from three months to nine months 
for all inventory components on hand as of december   we reviewed the following assumptions to determine the amount of any necessary reserves expected production levels and estimated cost per dose  sales volume projections that are subject to variability  the expected price to be received for the product and anticipated distribution costs  and current information about the influenza strains recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention for each season s vaccine 
the methodology used to calculate adjustments required to value our flumist inventories as of december  at net realizable value was consistent with the methodology used for the valuations from approval in june through and as of december  the december  valuation of flumist inventories considered the disappointing sales results of our initial launch of flumist  which became available in late  and our revised sales estimates of flumist for both the and flu seasons 
as a result  we revised our sales volume estimates and decreased the estimated price expected to be received per dose for the flu season 
in addition  we decreased our estimated production levels based on our anticipated decrease in sales volumes  which increased the per unit cost to produce flumist 
using these assumptions  we compared the amount of expected flumist sales with the expected production cost to estimate the net realizable value of flumist inventories to be produced throughout the season 
sales and production estimates for the season incorporated into the inventory valuations performed as of december  and the first half of were generally consistent 
the valuation as of september  incorporated management s estimates of sales and production levels that were adjusted to take into account anticipated increased demand due to the shortage of injectable influenza vaccine in the us for the season 
the valuation of inventory as of december  is based on sales volume and price estimates for the season that are largely based on our actual experience for the season 
the table below summarizes the activity within the components of flumist inventories in millions gross inventory reserves net inventory flumist details as of december  raw materials  net production  net disposals and scrap cost of goods sold recognized on inventory during q of cost of goods sold recognized on inventory during q of as of december  because finished flumist product has an approved shelf life ranging from three to nine months  all finished product produced for a particular flu season must be sold within that season 
thus  if our actual sales fall below our projections  we will be required to write off any remaining inventory balance at the end of the flu season 
for our other products  we periodically assess our inventory balances to determine whether net realizable value is below recorded cost 
factors we consider include expected sales volume  production capacity and expiration dates 
we plan to replace the current lyophilized formulation of synagis with the newly approved liquid formulation during the rsv season pending final fda approval of the manufacturing facilities and processes 
as of december   we analyzed inventory quantities  including pending future commitments  and projected sales levels of the current formulation of synagis in connection with this conversion plan 
based on our review  we recorded a permanent inventory write down for excess inventories of million 
no other significant inventory adjustments were recorded during sales allowances and other sales related estimates reductions to gross product sales we record allowances for discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates due to government purchasers as a reduction to gross product sales 
the timing of actual discounts  returns  and chargebacks taken  and rebates paid to government purchasers can lag the sale of the product by up to several months 
as such  a significant amount of judgment is required when estimating the impact of sales allowances on gross sales for a reporting period 
the assumptions used in developing our estimates of sales reserves include the following key factors historical trends for discounts  returns  rebate claims  or other claims  our current contracts with customers and current discount programs  actual performance of customers against contractual volume targets tied to discounts  proportion of gross sales ultimately used by medicaid patients  state medicaid policies and reimbursement practices  and accuracy of reporting by our customers of end user product sales by state 
we update these factors for any known changes in facts or circumstances as soon as the changes are known 
if our historical trends are not indicative of the future  or our actual sales are materially different from the projected amounts  or if our assessments prove to be materially different than actual occurrence  our results could be affected 
the estimation process for determining reserves for sales allowances inherently results in adjustments each year 
additionally  because of the varying lags and the seasonal nature of our largest product  synagis  our sales discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates fluctuate throughout the year 
if our estimate of the percentage of gross sales to be recorded for sales allowances for synagis were to increase by  our revenues for the synagis sales season which runs from july to june would have been reduced by approximately million 
a decrease of in the sales allowances for synagis during the same period would have increased our revenues by approximately million 
we estimate the amount of rebates due to government purchasers quarterly based on historical experience  along with updates  and based on our best estimate of the proportion of sales that will be subject to this reimbursement  largely comprised of medicaid payments to state governments 
during the first quarter of  we lowered our estimate of rebates due to government purchasers to reflect favorable historical experience and a change in our estimate of the proportion of the sales that are subject to reimbursement 
during the fourth quarter of  we became aware of efforts by several states to collect rebates for product administered in certain settings for which reimbursement was not sought in the past 
after analyzing the situation  we determined that the new facts and circumstances warranted an increase in our estimate of rebates due to government purchasers 
as such  we recorded additional reserves for rebates due to government purchasers of approximately million during the fourth quarter of  and increased our estimate of the proportion of current sales that will be subject to reimbursement  given the change in circumstance 
for the years ended december   and  allowances for discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates due to government purchasers resulted in a net reduction to gross product sales of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in is attributable to flumist sales  which experience higher discount and return rates than our other products  and higher levels of medicaid reporting compliance for reimbursement 
allowances for discounts  returns  and chargebacks  which are netted against accounts receivable  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
allowances for government reimbursements were million and million as of december  and  respectively  and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
selling  general and administrative expenses we estimate our co promotion expense and sales commissions by applying an estimated rate that is based upon an estimate of projected sales for the season to our actual sales for the period 
we decreased co promotion expense by million in and increased co promotion expense by million in  resulting from the final reconciliation of net sales for the and contract years 
no significant adjustments to co promotion expense were made during we estimate the level of bad debts as a percentage of gross trade accounts receivable balances outstanding at the end of the period  based upon our assessment of the concentration of credit risk  the financial condition and environment of our customers  and the level of credit insurance  if any  we obtain on our customers balances 
because of the seasonal nature of our largest product  synagis  our accounts receivable balances fluctuate significantly 
accordingly  our allowance for doubtful accounts also fluctuates 
our accounts receivable balances tend to be highest at the end of december and march  while the september balances are somewhat lower as our selling season is just beginning  and the june balances are significantly lower  reflecting the close out of the prior season 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million in reductions to bad debt expense  largely based on our current assessment of the factors above 
bad debt expense is classified as selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are anticipated to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
in general  should we determine that we are able to realize more than the recorded amounts of net deferred tax assets in the future  our net income will increase in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  our net income would decrease in the period such determination was made 
reversals of valuation allowance related to acquired deferred tax assets  however  would first be applied against goodwill and other intangibles before impacting net income 
a tax reserve is recorded when we cannot assert that it is probable that a tax position claimed on a return will be sustained upon challenge by the tax authority 
any change in the balance of a tax reserve during the year is treated as an adjustment to current year tax expense 
during  we reached a state tax settlement that enabled us to release a tax contingency reserve of million  resulting in a benefit to our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  our uk subsidiary recognized income in for uk tax purposes  which enabled us to release a valuation allowance for net operating losses of approximately million  resulting in a favorable impact to the consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded and valued significant intangible assets that we acquired as a result of the acquisition 
we engaged independent valuation experts who reviewed our critical assumptions and assisted us in determining a value for the identifiable intangibles 
of the million of acquired intangible assets  million was assigned to the worldwide collaborative agreement with wyeth for the development  manufacture  distribution  marketing  promotion  and sale of flumist 
we estimated the fair value of the wyeth agreement using the sum of the probability adjusted scenarios under the income approach 
in applying this method  we relied on revenue assumptions  profitability assumptions and anticipated approval dates 
the remaining million was assigned to a contract manufacturing agreement with evans vaccines limited 
we estimated the fair value of the evans agreement using the cost approach  which is based on the theory that a prudent investor would pay no more for an asset than the amount for which the asset could be replaced 
in our analysis  we reduced replacement cost for such factors as physical deterioration and functional or economic obsolescence 
we review intangible assets for impairment when an event that could result in an impairment occurs 
as a result of the dissolution of the collaboration with wyeth during  we recorded a permanent impairment loss of million that represented the remaining unamortized cost of the related intangible asset 
as of december   there was no further impairment of our intangible assets  of which million remains unamortized 
during and  we made adjustments to goodwill recorded in the acquisition of million and million  respectively  reflecting adjustments to deferred tax assets relating to the resolution of income tax related uncertainties 
we review goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter and during interim periods if an event that could result in an impairment occurs 
as of december   we have not identified any impairment of goodwill  of which million remains on the consolidated balance sheet 
investments in debt and equity securities our short term and long term investments are subject to adjustment for other than temporary impairments 
impairment charges are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when a decline in the fair value of an investment falls below its cost value and is judged to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment charge is required  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  fundamental changes to the business prospects of the issuer  share prices of subsequent offerings  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
during  and  we recorded impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively  based on the duration and magnitude of the declines in the fair value of certain of our investments  as well as the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee companies 
results of operations comparison of to revenues product sales growth in millions synagis ethyol flumist n a other products during  product sales grew to billion as compared to billion during  primarily due to an increase in sales of synagis to million 
of the overall increase in product sales  approximately five percentage points were due to the recognition of flumist product sales for the first time in domestic price increases accounted for five growth points  and an additional two percentage points were due to increases in domestic sales volume  but were largely negated by higher sales allowances that reduced sales by two percentage points 
international sales added three points of growth 
synagis synagis accounted for approximately and of our product sales for and  respectively 
we achieved a increase in domestic synagis sales to million for  up from million in of the growth year over year  five percentage points resulted from price increases and four percentage points were due to higher sales volumes  which were partially offset by higher sales allowances that caused a reduction of two percentage points 
our reported international sales of synagis increased to million in compared to million in  largely due to a increase in units sold to abbott international ai  our exclusive distributor of synagis outside of the united states 
we believe this growth is primarily due to increased product demand by our end users  including physicians  hospitals  and pharmacies 
also contributing to international sales growth was an increase in the sales price caused by a change in the mix of countries to which we sell synagis internationally that favorably impacted the average sales price  and the favorable currency translation impact of a weakened us dollar 
we record synagis international product sales based on ai s sales price to customers  as contractually defined 
ethyol ethyol accounted for approximately and of our product sales for and  respectively 
worldwide ethyol sales declined to million in  as compared to million in domestic sales of ethyol declined from prior year  driven by an eight percentage point decline due to volume and an additional four points due to an increase in sales allowances  offset by six growth points due to price increases 
we believe that the lower domestic sales volumes for are largely due to the depletion of wholesaler inventories from december  levels to accommodate end user demand and the impact  which we believe is temporary  of the adoption of a relatively new form of radiation treatment in the head and neck cancer market 
international sales of etyhol declined over the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in unit volume to our international distribution partner  schering 
we record ethyol international product sales based on a percentage of schering s end user sales  as contractually defined 
flumist our product sales of flumist amounted to million  including product sales for the flu season of million  representing estimated net doses of approximately million 
sales also include transfer price revenues of million for product shipped to wyeth  our former partner  during related to the season 
at december   we concluded that the variables associated with flumist product revenues were not determinable  largely due to low sales volume and the lack of returns history and comparable rebate redemption rates for the new product 
as a result  no product revenues were recognized during associated with the million doses that were shipped to wyeth during other products sales of other products include sales of cytogam  respigam  neutrexin and by products that result from the cytogam manufacturing process and amounted to million in as compared to million in the slight decrease is primarily due to the decline in sales of respigam  which has been replaced in the marketplace by our second generation rsv product  synagis  and is no longer manufactured 
revenues other revenues other revenues of million for are lower than other revenues of million largely due to decreased revenues under collaborative agreements 
during  we recognized million of milestone revenue under our international distribution agreement with ai upon the achievement of end user sales of synagis outside the us in excess of million in a single rsv season 
other revenues in also include contractual payments received from wyeth prior to dissolution of our collaboration  including royalties related to the influenza season  supply goal payments  and corporate funding for clinical development and sales and marketing programs 
during  we recognized million of revenues under the collaboration with wyeth related to milestone payments  supply goal payments  and funding for clinical development and marketing programs 
also during  we recognized million of milestone revenue for achieving in excess of million in end user sales of synagis outside the us during a single rsv season 
cost of sales cost of sales for increased to million from million for gross margins on product sales were for  down four percentage points from gross margins of for gross margins for all products  excluding flumist  aggregated to of product sales for both and the negative impact of flumist on gross margins was less in than largely due to the shift in costs of flumist manufacturing that are included in inventory and cost of goods sold during  but were expensed as other operating costs during the first quarter of  prior to fda approval of the product 
research and development expenses total research and development expenses more than doubled during to million from million in research and development expenses  as reported in the accompanying statements of operations  include both our ongoing expenses of drug discovery and development efforts  as well as costs related to the technology transfer and transition activities associated with reacquisition of the influenza vaccines franchise from wyeth during the technology transfer and transition costs  totaling approximately million  are largely amounts paid to wyeth for collection and analysis of data from five late stage caiv t studies conducted by wyeth over the last several years  including assistance in documenting study reports  closing and locking databases for clinical trials  and transition of clinical study results to our clinical databases 
the costs also include payments for the maintenance of the caiv t development facility and production of caiv t clinical trial material  as well as assistance with internal technology transfer of manufacturing operations for caiv t 
the increase in our ongoing expenses of drug discovery and development efforts is related to a large number of new and ongoing clinical and preclinical studies  particularly for numax  caiv t and vitaxin  as well as costs associated with the expansion of infrastructure to support these studies 
during november  we advanced the numax program into phase clinical trials  with a pivotal head to head trial with synagis  and a second trial designed to assess whether numax can reduce the incidence of rsv hospitalization in native american infants 
we are also completing a phase trial with numax 
during october  we initiated a phase trial that will compare caiv t to the traditional injectible flu vaccine in children from months to months of age  and a phase bridging study designed to compare caiv t with frozen flumist 
we also progressed with two ongoing phase trials for vitaxin targeting melanoma and prostate cancer  while we discontinued two trials for vitaxin targeting rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis based on preliminary data suggesting lack of clinical benefit in these inflammatory diseases 
also during  we began a phase clinical trial with an anti interleukin il monoclonal antibody to evaluate the molecule as a potential treatment for symptomatic  moderate to severe persistent asthma 
during  we also made a million payment to medarex  inc as part of a new collaboration to co develop antibodies targeting interferon alpha and the type interferon receptor for the treatment of autoimmune diseases 
we have several programs in clinical and pre clinical development  but a summary of our more significant current internal research and development efforts is as follows product candidates description stage of development numax second generation anti rsv monoclonal antibody phase caiv t refrigerator stable version of intranasal influenza vaccine  live phase vitaxin monoclonal antibody for the treatment of melanoma and prostate cancer phase flumist intranasally delivered virus vaccine to prevent influenza infection phase ethyol subcutaneous administration in non small cell lung cancer patients reduction of esophogitis and pneumonitis phase selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase is largely attributable to costs associated with expanding the pediatric commercial organization  increased co promotion expense  and increased marketing activities and professional services 
excluding the amounts incurred during for wyeth related transition activities and the favorable impact in both years of adjustments to the bad debt provision based upon changes in our assessment of credit risk  sg a expense as a percentage of product sales was and in and  respectively 
other operating expenses other operating expenses  which reflect manufacturing start up costs and other manufacturing related costs  decreased to million in from million in the decrease is due to the shift in the costs of flumist manufacturing that are in inventory and cost of goods sold this year  but were expensed as other operating costs in the prior year prior to the june approval of flumist 
other operating expenses in both periods also include excess capacity charges associated with the plasma production portion of the frederick manufacturing center 
impairment of intangible asset as a result of entering into agreements to dissolve the collaboration with wyeth during april  we recorded a permanent impairment loss of million that represented the remaining unamortized cost originally recorded for the original collaboration with wyeth 
acquired ipr d we recorded a charge of million for acquired ipr d for in conjunction with our reacquisition of the influenza vaccines franchise from wyeth 
the charge represents the relative fair value of purchased in process technologies at the acquisition date  calculated utilizing the income approach  of certain ipr d projects  primarily caiv t 
see further discussion of ipr d in the critical accounting estimates section of this management s discussion and analysis 
interest income and expense we earned interest income of million for  compared to million in  reflecting higher average investment balances and higher average rates 
interest expense for  net of amounts capitalized  was million  down from million in the decline is due to the retirement of the convertible subordinated notes in march  partially offset by a decrease in the amount of interest cost capitalized in versus the prior period  due to the completion of several large construction projects in  including the new r d facility and corporate headquarters in maryland 
loss gain on investment activities we incurred a million loss on investment activities for  compared to a gain of million in the loss consists of impairment write downs of million due to the decline in fair value of certain of our investments in private companies below their cost basis that were determined to be other than temporary  partially offset by net realized gains on sales of common stock and other investments totaling million 
during  we recognized gains on the sale of common stock and other investments of million  partially offset by impairment write downs and charges to record our portion of our minority investees operating results as required by the equity method of accounting 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
comparatively  we recorded income tax expense of million for  which resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the year over year change in our estimated effective tax rate is due in part due to million of non deductible charges for ipr d during the second quarter of our effective tax rate in was also favorably impacted by the increase in credits available for research and development activities  including credits earned for orphan drug status of certain research and experimentation activities  corresponding to the overall growth in research and experimentation activity over these credits will vary from year to year depending on our activities and the enactment of tax legislation 
also during  we reached a state tax settlement and our uk subsidiary recognized income for uk tax purposes  enabling us to release valuation allowance and tax contingency reserves  resulting in a favorable impact to the consolidated statement of operations 
net loss earnings we reported a net loss for of million  or per share compared to net earnings for of million or per diluted share 
shares used in computing loss per share for were million  while shares used for computing basic and diluted earnings per share for were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in share count is primarily attributable to our stock repurchase program that we implemented in july we do not believe inflation had a material effect on our financial statements 
comparison of to revenues product sales growth in millions synagis ethyol flumist other products product sales grew in to million as compared to million in  primarily due to increased sales of synagis 
of the overall increase in product sales  approximately points of the percentage points were due to an increase in domestic sales volumes  while price increases  net of increases in sales allowances contributed five points to sales growth 
the remaining four points of growth were due to an increase in our international sales 
synagis synagis accounted for approximately and of our and product sales  respectively 
we achieved a increase in domestic synagis sales to million in  up from million in this growth was largely due to increased sales volume in the us  which resulted in a increase in domestic units sold 
also aiding growth was a price increase that took effect in june  partially offset by an increase in sales allowances  which are accounted for as a reduction of product sales 
our reported international sales of synagis to ai more than doubled to million in compared to million in  driven primarily by a more than two fold increase in unit volumes over levels 
the increase in unit volume was offset by a decrease in the realized per unit sales price recognized upon delivery of product to ai under the terms of our international distribution agreement 
ethyol ethyol accounted for approximately of our product sales in both and domestic ethyol sales increased to million in  up from million in this increase was the result of a increase in domestic units sold in compared to and a price increase which occurred in august our international sales of ethyol to our distribution partner  schering  were consistent with sales of million 
flumist during  we received payments totaling million upon the shipment of million doses of flumist to wyeth  our former partner who was contractually responsible for distributing the product to third parties 
the final selling price for the doses shipped to wyeth was largely dependent on wyeth s net sales to end users 
as of december   we concluded that the variables associated with the product transfer price were not determinable  largely due to low sales volume and the lack of returns history and comparable redemption rates for rebates for flumist in its launch season 
as a result  we did not recognize the revenue associated with the million doses shipped to wyeth during product sales for these shipments were recognized during the first quarter of  once the influenza season was substantially over and wyeth s ultimate net sales to end users were determinable 
other products sales of other products in  which include sales of cytogam  neutrexin  respigam  and by products that result from the cytogam manufacturing process  increased million  or compared to the increase was largely due to a increase in our sales of cytogam 
revenues other revenues other revenues for remained consistent with at million 
other revenues in were largely comprised of contractual payments received from wyeth under our collaborative agreement for flumist 
the payments  which amounted to million  related to milestone payments  supply goal payments  and funding for clinical development and marketing programs 
we also received million in from ai for achieving a milestone related to international sales levels of synagis and we recorded million in revenue under other collaborative agreements 
other revenues in were comprised largely of million in payments from wyeth for compensation of flumist manufacturing costs and funding for clinical development and marketing programs 
in  we also received million from the sale of excess production capacity to a third party and million in revenue recorded under other collaborative agreements 
we have accounted for major collaborative agreements entered into before january  using the contingency adjusted performance model and have deferred a portion of the up front and milestone payments received 
based on current estimates  we expect to record the remaining revenues from our collaboration with affiliates of schering plough corporation of million ratably over and cost of sales cost of sales for increased to million from million for  mainly due to increases in product sales volumes and inventory valuation adjustments for flumist of million 
gross margins on product sales for were  down three percentage points from  largely due to the valuation adjustments for flumist inventory 
partially offsetting this decrease were lower costs for cytogam  and a favorable impact of a value added tax refund for transfers of synagis manufactured in europe 
research and development expenses research and development expenses of million in increased from million in the increase was due largely to payments made in associated with gaining access to new data and technologies  net of a decrease in clinical trials expense and a decrease in stock compensation expense for unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition and in retention payments and stock compensation expense for acceleration of stock options for certain of aviron s executives 
during  we made a million payment to critical therapeutics  inc as part of a new collaboration to co develop biologic products to treat severe inflammatory diseases 
additionally in  we initiated four phase studies for vitaxin and agreed to pay million for data from the completed international phase studies for a liquid formulation of flumist 
in  we completed several clinical trials  including phase clinical trials with siplizumab  and the phase synagis clinical trial in congenital heart disease patients that led to approval of an expanded indication by the fda in september selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased to million in compared to million for the period  largely due to increased co promotion expense  reflective of the increase in synagis sales 
as a percentage of product sales  sg a expense decreased to of product sales in the period from in the period  due to product sales growing at a faster rate than expenses 
other operating expenses other operating expenses  which reflect manufacturing start up costs and other manufacturing related costs  were million in compared to million in the decrease in other operating expenses was principally due to the shift in the costs of flumist manufacturing that are capitalized in inventory and expensed as cost of goods sold beginning in the second quarter of  but were expensed as other operating costs in the prior year 
additionally  other operating expenses included impairment charges of million relating to the write off of certain plasma manufacturing assets  as we outsourced production of cytogam during we also experienced decreases in stock compensation expense for unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition and in retention payments and stock compensation expense for acceleration of stock options for certain of aviron s executives 
in process research and development we incurred charges of  million in the first quarter of for the write off of purchased in process research and development in conjunction with the acquisition 
the write off represented the fair value of purchased in process technologies at the acquisition date  calculated as the sum of probability adjusted commercial scenarios 
this method was based upon management s estimates of the probability of fda approval and commercial success for flumist 
interest income and expense we earned interest income of million for  compared to million in  reflecting higher cash balances available for investment  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates  which lowered the overall portfolio yield 
interest expense for  net of amounts capitalized  was million  up from million for  principally due to interest expense generated by the notes issued in july gain loss on investment activities we incurred a gain on investment activities of million for  compared to a loss of million for the gain consisted of gains on the sale of our publicly traded equity investments  net of declines in fair value of other investments that were judged to be other than temporary 
investment losses in consisted primarily of impairment charges on investments related to declines in fair value that were judged to be other than temporary 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december   based on an effective tax rate of 
we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  excluding items not deductible for tax purposes  principally the write off of purchased in process research and development  the resulting effective tax rate for was 
net earnings loss net earnings for were million  or per share basic and per share diluted  compared to a net loss for of billion or per share 
shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share in were and  respectively 
shares used in computing net loss per share for were million 
we do not believe inflation had a material effect on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our capital requirements have been funded from operations  cash and investments on hand  and issuance of common stock and convertible debt 
cash and marketable securities were billion at december  as compared to billion at december   a decrease of million 
this decrease in cash and marketable securities is primarily due to the combined impact of the retirement of the convertible subordinated notes in march and payments made to wyeth in conjunction with our reaquisition of full rights to the influenza vaccines franchise 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december   also due to the retirement of the notes and the payments made to wyeth  as well as a shift in our fixed income portfolio mix to longer term maturities 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the comparable period  primarily the result of the decrease in net earnings in  excluding the noncash charge for the impairment of an intangible asset  and the final settlement of advances from wyeth and payments made to wyeth for technology transfer and transition activities related to the dissolution of our collaboration 
investing activities cash used for investing activities during was million  as compared to million in cash used for investing activities in included net additions to our investment portfolio of million  capital expenditures of million  primarily for the construction of our new r d facility and corporate headquarters in gaithersburg  maryland  the expansion of our flumist manufacturing facilities in speke  england  and construction of our new pilot plant in gaithersburg  maryland  which began in  million paid to wyeth for certain in process technologies and ipr d projects  primarily caiv t  and the distribution facility in louisville  and minority interest investments in strategic partners totaling million through our venture capital subsidiary 
financing activities financing activities in used million in cash  as compared to cash generated of million in during  we used million in cash to repurchase and retire the balance of the notes  and an additional million to repurchase shares of our common stock as authorized under our share repurchase program 
approximately million was received upon the issuance of common stock relating primarily to the exercise of employee stock options in  compared to million received in during  we received net cash proceeds of million in connection with the issuance of the notes  which was partially offset by treasury stock repurchases of million 
our primary source of liquidity is operating cash flow 
management continues to believe that such internally generated cash flow as well as its existing funds will be adequate to service its existing debt and other cash requirements 
we expend cash to finance our research and development and clinical trial programs  to obtain access to new technologies through collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners  through our venture capital subsidiary  or through other means  to fund capital projects  and to finance the production of inventories 
in february  our board of directors increased the approved funding for our venture capital subsidiary from million to million 
during  we received a bbb rating on our outstanding indebtedness by standard poor s 
this rating is considered to be investment grade and we believe the rating will contribute to our ability to access capital markets  should we desire or need to do so 
we may raise additional capital in the future to take advantage of favorable conditions in the market or in connection with our development activities 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock during the period from july through june in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  pursuant to terms management deems appropriate and at such times it may designate 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program at a total cost of million  or an average cost of per share 
during  we repurchased million shares at a total cost of million  or an average cost of per share 
from january  through february   we purchased an additional million shares for approximately million  or an average cost of per share 
we are holding repurchased shares as treasury shares and are using them for general corporate purposes  including but not limited to acquisition related transactions and for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options 
in  we will continue construction of the flumist manufacturing facilities in speke  the united kingdom  and our new pilot plant in gaithersburg  maryland  and will break ground on additional administrative offices at the headquarters site in gaithersburg  maryland 
we expect our capital expenditures to approximate million in we anticipate these projects will be funded from cash generated from operations and investments on hand 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  that we anticipate will require significant cash outlays in the future in millions contractual obligations total beyond long term debt facilities leases purchase obligations obligations to evans total contractual obligations other commercial commitments standby letters of credit obligations under collaborative agreements total other commercial commitments the notes can be put to medimmune by the holders for cash in represents amounts due to evans vaccines limited pursuant to a sublease arranagement 
we have guaranteed performance under certain agreements related to our construction projects 
the undiscounted maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under such guarantees  in the aggregate  is approximately million 
we participate in a number of research and development collaborations to develop and market certain technologies and products 
the amounts indicated as obligations under collaborative agreements represent committed funding obligations to our collaborative partners under our various development programs 
the amounts do not include developmental and sales milestone payments totaling million or royalties on potential future product sales related to these collaborations since the amount  timing  and likelihood of the payments is unknown as they are dependent on the occurrence of future events that may or may not occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
our primary market risks as of december  are our exposures to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
as of december   our excess cash balances are primarily invested in marketable debt securities with investment grade credit ratings 
substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are held in custody by three major us financial institutions 
deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
generally  these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and  therefore  bear minimal risk 
our investments consist principally of us government and agency securities and corporate notes and bonds 
the maturities range from one month to seven years 
our investment guidelines are intended to limit the amount of investment exposure as to issuer  maturity  and investment type 
the fair value of these investments is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
further  interest income earned on variable rate debt securities is exposed to changes in the general level of interest rates 
the following table presents principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for each class of debt security with similar characteristics in millions total fair value us gov t and agencies interest rate corp

medimmune ventures  inc  the company s wholly owned venture capital subsidiary  manages the company s current portfolio of minority interest investments and endeavors to make additional investments in public or private biotechnology companies focused on discovering and developing human therapeutics 
the company has approved funding to medimmune ventures for up to million in investments  of which million has been invested as of february  medimmune ventures will invest primarily in areas of strategic interest to the company  including infectious disease  immunology and oncology 
the cost basis of medimmune ventures investment holdings  net of impairment writedowns  was million as of december  our minority interest investments are subject to adjustment for other than temporary impairments 
we recognize impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations when a decline in the fair value of an investment falls below its cost value and is judged to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  fundamental changes to the business prospects of the investee  share prices of subsequent offerings  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
during  and  the company recorded impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively  based on the duration and magnitude of the declines in fair value  as well as the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee companies 
we expect the volatility in the fair value of our minority investments to continue and  thus  the value assigned to the investments could change significantly from period to period 
as of december   medimmune ventures portfolio included approximately million shares of common stock of two publicly traded companies with a cost basis of million and fair value of million 
during and  medimmune ventures liquidated its equity holdings in two public companies over a period of approximately one year  in accordance with our investment strategy  resulting in realized gains of million and million  respectively 
the remainder of medimmune ventures portfolio as of december  consists primarily of minority interest investments in privately held biotechnology companies 
the investments are maintained on the cost or equity method of accounting  according to the facts and circumstances of the individual investment 
for investments carried on the equity method  the company records its proportionate share of the investees gains or losses on a quarterly basis  which was immaterial during  and as of december   the investments had a cost basis of million  net of permanent writedowns 
during july  we issued million of convertible notes due these notes bear interest at per annum payable semi annually in arrears 
beginning with the six month interest period commencing july   if the average trading price of these notes during specified periods equals or exceeds of the principal amount of such notes  we will pay contingent interest equal to per six month period of the average trading price per  of the principal amount during such periods 
as a result  if the market value of these notes appreciates significantly in the future  we could be obligated to pay amounts of contingent interest beginning in the estimated fair value of the notes at december   based on quoted market prices  was million 
our remaining outstanding indebtedness of million at december  is in the form of notes that bear interest primarily at fixed rates 
the estimated fair value of the remaining long term debt at december   based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flows at currently available borrowing rates  was million 
maturities for all long term debt for the next five years are as follows  million   million   million   million  and  million 
expenditures relating to our manufacturing operations in the united kingdom and the netherlands are paid in local currency 
we have not hedged our expenditures relating to these manufacturing operations  therefore  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may result in increases or decreases in the amount of expenditures recorded 
additionally  certain of our distribution agreements outside the united states provide for us to be paid based upon sales in local currency 
as a result  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the amount we expect to collect under these agreements 
we have entered into a supplemental manufacturing contract with boehringer ingelheim pharma gmbh co 
kg bi denominated in euros for the supplemental manufacturing of synagis 
fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate may lead to changes in our us dollar cost of manufacturing 
to reduce the risk of unpredictable changes in these costs  the company may  from time to time  enter into forward foreign exchange contracts 
as of december   the company did not have any open foreign exchange forward contracts 
currently  we have firm commitments with bi for planned production and fill finish through for approximately million euros million using the exchange rate as of december
