item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview hurco companies  inc is an industrial technology company operating in a single segment 
we design and produce computerized machine tools  featuring our proprietary computer control systems and software  for sale through our own distribution network to the worldwide metal cutting market 
we also provide software options  control upgrades  accessories and replacement parts for our products  as well as customer service and training support 
our computerized metal cutting machine tools are manufactured in taiwan to our specifications by our wholly owned subsidiary  hurco manufacturing limited hml  and an affiliate 
we sell our products through approximately independent agents and distributors in approximately countries throughout north america  europe and asia 
we also have our own direct sales and service organizations in england  france  germany  italy  singapore and china 
the machine tool industry is highly cyclical and changes in demand can occur abruptly 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and continuing through the third quarter of fiscal  we experienced a significant decline in global demand 
for example  our customer orders during the first quarter of fiscal were at their lowest level in ten years 
during the downturn  we took actions to discontinue the production and sale of underperforming products  refocused on our core product lines and significantly reduced our operating costs 
we also introduced new product models in late fiscal and throughout and these new models  together with an increase in worldwide demand for machine tools that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal  were largely responsible for the significant increase in our sales that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal approximately of worldwide demand for machine tools comes from outside the united states 
during fiscal and  approximately of our sales and service fees were attributable to customers located abroad 
our sales to foreign customers are denominated  and payments by those customers are made  in the prevailing currencies primarily the euro and pound sterling in the countries in which those customers are located  and our product costs are incurred and paid primarily in the new taiwan dollar and us dollars 
changes in currency exchange rates can have a material effect on our operating results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles 
for example  when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar  sales made and expenses incurred in that currency  w hen translated to us dollars for reporting in our financial statements  are higher than would be the case when that currency has a lower value relative to the us dollar 
in our comparison of period to period results  we discuss not only the increases or decreases in those results as reported in our financial statements which reflect translation to us dollars at prevailing exchange rates  but also the effect that changes in exchange rates had on those results 
our high levels of foreign manufacturing and sales also subject us to cash flow risks due to fluctuating currency exchange rates 
we seek to mitigate those risks through the use of various hedging instruments principally foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the volatility of demand for machine tools can significantly impact our working capital requirements and  therefore  our cash flow from operations and our operating profits 
because our products are manufactured in taiwan  manufacturing and ocean transportation lead times require that we schedule machine tool production based on forecasts of customer orders for a future period of four or five months 
we continually monitor order activity levels and adjust future production schedules to reflect changes in demand  but a significant unexpected decline in customer orders from forecasted levels can temporarily increase our finished g oods inventories and our use of working capital 
results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal years indicated  selected items from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of worldwide sales and service fees and the year to year percentage changes in the dollar amounts of those items 
percentage of revenues year to year change increase decrease vs 
vs 
sales and service fees gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring expense and other expenses  net n a n a operating income loss n a interest expense net income loss n a fiscal compared with fiscal net income for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to  or 
per share in the prior year 
the improvement in net income was primarily due to a substantial increase in sales of our computerized machine tools  which was attributable to demand for our newer models introduced in and  and improving market conditions  and also reflected the benefit of stronger european currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we introduced the vm product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal to improve our competitiveness in the entry level machining center market 
the vm product line has been successful in both the domestic and international markets 
in the united states  we believe we have an approximate market share in the entry level machining center market 
in fiscal and  we shipped and vm units  respectively  worldwide  which resulted in approximately million and million  respectively  of incremental computerized machine tool sales 
our operating results for fiscal were favorably impacted by further strengthening of foreign currencies  particularly the euro  in relation to the us dollar  when translating foreign sales and service fees into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
as noted in the following table  approximately of our net sales and service fees in fiscal were derived from european markets 
the weighted average exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro during fiscal was  as compared to for fiscal  an increase of 
net sales and service fees by geographic region the following tables set forth net sales and service fees by geographic region for the years ended october  and in thousands october  increase amount americas europe asia pacific total total sales and service fees on a worldwide basis were million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a million  or  increase 
however  million  or  of the increase in total sales and service fees was due to changes in currency exchange rates 
in the americas  sales and service fees increased million  or  due primarily to the continued growth of the vm product line 
shipments of vm units increased in fiscal compared to fiscal while shipments of our higher priced vmx product line increased during that same period 
the increase in our sales and service fees in the united states reflects a increase in unit orders for our vertical machining centers in fiscal compared to fiscal that percentage increase was substantially greater than the industry wide increase of for unit orders for vertical machining centers in the united states  as reported by the association for manufacturing technology 
in europe  our sales and service fees increased by million  or  as a result of increased unit sales and the favorable effect of stronger european currencies 
approximately million  or  of the increase in our sales and service fees was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates 
sales and service fees in the asia pacific region were not significantly affected by currency rates  but did reflect improved activity in asian markets 
net sales and service fees by product category the following table sets forth net sales and service fees by product category for years ended october  and in thousands october  increase amount computerized machine tools service fees  parts and other total hurco established new records for computerized machine tool sales and new order bookings in fiscal sales of computerized machine tools totaled million  an increase of million  or  of which million was attributable to the favorable effects of currency translation 
unit shipments of computerized machine tools increased  fueled by a increase in shipments of products in the vm product line 
the average net selling price per unit of computerized machine tool models was substantially unchanged in fiscal compared to fiscal  notwith standing the disproportionate increase in shipments of our lower priced vm models  due primarily to the beneficial effects of currency translation 
however  the average net selling price per unit  measured in local currencies  declined approximat ely due primarily to the greater portion of those vm products in the total product mix 
new order bookings for fiscal totaled  an increase of million  or  as compared to million recorded in fiscal approximately million  or of the increase  was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates 
the increase in constant us dollars was attributable primarily to orders for the vm product line 
unit orders for the vm product line increased by in fiscal compared to the prior year  while unit orders of the vmx product increased during that same period 
backlog was million at october  compared to million at october  gross margin for fiscal was  an increase over the margin realized in the corresponding period  due principally to increased sales volume and the favorable effects of stronger european currencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million increased million  or  from those of the corresponding period primarily due to currency translation effects  increased commissions to european selling agents associated with the increase in european sales and increased sales and marketing expenditures 
operating income for fiscal totaled million  or of sales  compared to  or of sales  in the prior year 
operating income in fiscal included a  one time severance charge 
variable option expense of  is related to certain stock options  which were subject to variable plan accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these stock options have all been exercised so no additional variable option expense is expected 
other income expense  net in fiscal includes currency exchange losses on inter company receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  net of gains or losses on related forward contracts  profits of subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method  and other non operating income and expense items 
the provision for income taxes is related to the earnings of two foreign subsidiaries 
in the united states and certain other foreign jurisdictions  we have net operating loss carryforwards for which we have a valuation reserve at october  because the significant size of those carry forwards relative to our current rate of earnings creates uncertainty about the realization of the tax benefits in future years 
the provision for income tax increased in fiscal solely because of increased earnings from our taxable foreign subsidiaries 
fiscal compared with fiscal net income for fiscal was  or 
per share  compared to a net loss of million in the prior year 
we attribute our return to profitability to incremental sales from a new  entry level machine model the vm introduced in late fiscal  strengthening european currencies in relation to the us dollar and the implementation of restructuring and cost reduction actions during the eighteen months period that began in april in addition  results for fiscal were disproportionately impacted by million of restructuring expense 
we developed the vm to improve our competitiveness in the entry level machining center market 
the vm has been successful in both the domestic and international markets 
in the united states  we obtained an approximate market share in the entry level machining center market as of october in fiscal  we shipped vm units worldwide  which resulted in approximately million of incremental machine sales 
our operating results for fiscal were also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro  in relation to the us dollar when translating foreign sales and service fees into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
as noted in the following table  approximately of our net sales and service fees in fiscal were derived from european markets 
the weighted average exchange rate for the euro during fiscal was  as compared to 
for fiscal  an increase of 
net sales and service fees by geographic region the following tables set forth net sales by geographic region for the years ended october  and in thousands october  americas europe asia pacific total total sales and service fees on a worldwide basis were million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a million  or  increase 
however  on a constant dollar basis  sales and service fees were million  a million decrease 
in the americas  sales and service fees from continuing products and services increased million  or  due primarily to the successful introduction of the vm  in late fiscal this increase was offset by a decrease of million in sales of discontinued products  the liquidation of which was substantially completed in fiscal in europe  sales and service fees increased by million as a result of the favorable effect of stronger european currencies 
however  when measured at constant exchange rates  sales and service fees in europe decreased million  or  reflecting the continuing weakness in industrial equipment spending and reduced consumption of machine tools by many manufacturing companies  particularly in germany 
sales and service fees in the asia pacific region were not significantly affected by currency rates  but reflected improved activity in asian markets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales and service fees increased over those for each of the preceding three fiscal quarters  reflecting an improvement in worldwide computerized machine tool demand from the depressed levels of the prior three years 
net sales and service fees by product category the following table sets forth net sales and service fees by product category for the fiscal years ended october  and in thousands october  continuing products and services computerized machine tools computer control systems and software service parts service fees total discontinued products and services total discontinued product sales were made solely in the united states 
sales of continuing machine tool products increased million  or  of which million was attributable to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation 
unit shipments of continuing machine tool models increased  as sales of the vm more than offset a decline in the balance of the product line 
the average net selling price per unit of continuing machine tool models decreased approximately due to product mix and discounting  the effects of which were partially offset by the favorable effects of currency translation 
when measured at constant exchange rates  the average net selling price per continuing unit declined approximately new order bookings for fiscal were million  an increase of from million recorded in fiscal when measured at constant exchange rates  however  new order bookings increased million  or 
new order bookings for continuing products and services increased million  or  when measured at constant exchange rates 
the increase in orders for continuing products in constant us dollars was attributable to orders for the vm model  which more than offset the effect of weak order rates in the first nine months of fiscal related to the balance of the product line 
new order bookings increased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal and were million  million  million and million for each of the four quarters in fiscal backlog was million at october  compared to million at october  gross margin increased in fiscal to from which includes a million restructuring charge in fiscal  due in part to strengthening european currencies as well as previously reported employee cost reductions and fewer sales of discontinued products  which were liquidated at discounted prices 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million for fiscal represented a decline of  or  from the level of the corresponding period 
when measured at constant exchange rates  the decrease in sg a expenses was million  or 
the decrease was a result of previously reported employee cost reductions  lower research and development expenses  and reduced sales and marketing expenditures  but it was offset  in part  by the effects of a weaker us dollar when translating expenses incurred outside the united states for financial reporting purposes 
other expense  net includes  related to certain stock options that are subject to variable plan accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
expense for this item in future periods will be directly impacted by changes in the price of our common stock until the options are exercised 
other expense  net in fiscal also includes currency exchange losses on inter company receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  net of gains or losses on related forward contracts  and other non operating income and expense items 
the provision for income taxes is related to the earnings of two foreign subsidiaries 
in the united states and certain other foreign jurisdictions  we have net operating loss carryforwards for which we have a valuation reserve at october  the provision for income tax increased in fiscal because of increased earnings from our taxable foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million exclusive of  of restricted cash related to derivative instruments  compared to million at october  cash generated from operations totaled million and million at october  and  respectively 
the continuing weakness of the us dollar in relation to european currencies after october   will result in a temporary increase in restricted cash related to derivative instruments  pending the liquidation of forward contracts in the normal course during fiscal anticipated cash losses on these forward contracts will be funded by the increased us dollar value of the related inter company sales which are being hedged and  as a result  we do not expect cash flow from operations to be adversely affected 
working capital  excluding short term debt  was million at october  compared to million at october  an million increase in the aggregate amount of accounts receivable and inventory during fiscal was offset by an million increase in accounts payable 
the increase in inventory was due to a build up of finished product and an increase in work in process inventory to meet a forecasted increase in demand 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to increased manufacturing activity  accompanied by favorable payment terms from our suppliers in taiwan 
we expect our operating working capital requirements to increase in fiscal as our sales and service fees increase 
we expect to fund any such increase with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our bank c redit facilities 
capital investments during the year consisted of normal expenditures for software development projects and purchases of equipment 
we funded these expenditures with cash flow from operations 
effective october   we amended our domestic bank credit agreement to extend the maturity date to january  and convert it to an unsecured facility except for a continuation of the pledge of stock of two subsidiaries 
borrowings may be made in us dollars  euros or pounds sterling 
interest on all outstanding borrowings is payable at libor for the respective currency plus an applicable margin  or  at our option  the bank s prime rate plus a specified margin based on the ratio of our total funded debt as defined to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as follows ratio of total funded debt ebitda libor margin prime margin greater than greater than and less than or equal to greater than and less than or equal to less than or equal to the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda at october  was 
the applicable margin is adjusted on the first day of the month following the month after each quarter end 
the availability under the facility is not limited by a borrowing base  unless the ratio exceeds the agreement requires that maximum consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization  as defined in the agreement  not exceed to and that our fixed charge coverage ratio not be less than to the agreement also requires that we have positive net income for the four previous quarters 
the terms and conditions of the october  amendment also apply to our revolving credit and overdraft facility for our uk subsidiary on january   we reduced our credit facility with a european bank from million to million and extended the expiration date to december  interest on the facility is payable at above euribor 
although the facility is uncollateralized  the bank reserves the right to require collateral in the event of increased risk evaluation 
borrowings outstanding under this facility at october  were total debt at october  was million representing of total capitalization  which aggregated million  compared to million  or of total capitalization  at october  we were in compliance with all loan covenants and had unused credit availability of million at october  we believe that cash flow from operations and borrowings available to us under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements in fiscal contractual obligations and commitments the following is a table of contractual obligations and commitments as of october  all amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases deferred credits and other total in addition to the contractual obligations and commitments disclosed above  we also have a variety of other obligations for the procurement of materials and services  none of which subject us to any material non cancelable commitments 
while some of these obligations arise under long term supply agreements  we are not committed under these agreements to accept or pay for requirements that are not needed to meet our production needs 
we have no material minimum purchase commitments or take or pay type agreements or arrangements 
with respect to capital expenditures  we expect capital spending in fiscal  exclusive of capitalized software development costs  to approximate million  which includes discretionary items 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  our european subsidiaries guarantee third party lease financing residuals in connection with the sale of certain machines in europe 
at october   we had outstanding third party guarantees totaling approximately million 
a retention of title clause allows our european subsidiaries to repossess a machine that is the subject of a lease guarantee if the customer defaults on its lease 
we believe that the proceeds obtained from liquidation of the machine would cover any payments required by the guarantee 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies  including those described below  require management to make significant estimates and assumptions using information available at the time the estimates are made 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of our machine tool systems upon delivery of the product to the customer  which is normally at the time of shipment  because ownership and risk of loss passes to the customer at that time and payment terms are fixed 
in certain foreign locations  we retain title after shipment under a retention of title clause solely to protect collectibility 
revenue recognition at the time of shipment is appropriate in this instance so long as all risks of ownership have passed to the buyer 
our computerized machine tools are general purpose computer controlled machine tools that are typically used in stand alone operations 
transfer of ownership and risk of loss are not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance 
prior to shipment  we test each machine to ensure the machine s compliance with standard operating specifications as listed in our sales literature 
depending upon geographic location  after shipment a machine may be installed at the customer s facilities by a distributor  independent contractor or hurco service technician 
in most instances where a machine is sold through a distributor  hurco has no installation involvement 
if sales are direct or through sales agents  hurco will typically complete the machine installation  which consists of the reassembly of certain parts that were removed for shipping and the re testing of the machine to ensure that it is performing within the standard specifications 
we consider the machine installation process inconsequential and perfunctory 
service fees from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized in earnings on a pro rata basis over the term of the contract 
sales related to software products are recognized when shipped in conformity with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position software revenue recognition 
inventories we determine at each balance sheet date how much  if any  of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at its carrying cost 
reserves are established to effectively adjust the carrying value of such inventory to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of valuation reserves  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
deferred tax asset valuation as of october   we have deferred tax assets of million for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance  which has reduced the net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to zero 
these deferred tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  as well as federal business tax credits carried forward in the united states 
the benefit of some of these carryforwards expire at certain dates and utilization of certain others is limited to specific amounts each year 
realization of those benefits is entirely dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable earnings in the specific tax jurisdictions b efore the carryforwards expire 
due to the substantial size of the carryforwards there is uncertainty whether these tax benefits can be utilized before they expire 
therefore  we have established a full valuation allowance 
the need for this allowance is reviewed periodically  and if reduced in future periods  the associated tax benefits will be recorded in future operations as a reduction of income tax expense 
capitalized software development costs costs incurred to develop new computer software products and significant enhancements to software features of existing products are capitalized as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  and amortized over the estimated product life of the related software 
the determination as to when in the product development cycle technological feasibility has been established  and the expected product life  require judgments and estimates by management and can be affected by technological developments  innovations by competitors and changes in market conditions affecting demand 
we capitalized  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal related to software development projects 
also in fiscal  we wrote off million of previously capitalized costs related to a discontinued product line 
at october  we have an asset of million for capitalized software development projects  a significant portion of which relates to projects currently in process and subject to development risk and market acceptance 
we periodically review the carrying values of these assets and make judgments as to ultimate realization considering the above mentioned risk factors 
derivative financial instruments critical aspects of our accounting policy for derivative financial instruments include conditions that require that critical terms of a hedging instrument are essentially the same as a hedged forecasted transaction 
another important element of the policy demands that formal documentation be maintained as required by the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
failure to comply with these conditions would result in a requirement to recognize changes in market value of hedge instruments in earnings 
we routinely monitor significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments associated with der ivative instruments  and compliance with formal documentation requirements 
stock compensation we apply the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for stock based compensation  therefore  no compensation expense has been recognized for stock options  except for certain shares subject to variable plan accounting  as options are granted at fair market value 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation provides an alternative method of accounting for stock options based on an option pricing model  such as black scholes 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
information and assumptions regarding compensation expense under the alternative method i s provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest expense on our outstanding debt  all of which is subject to floating rates based either on libor or the lending bank s prime rate 
if market interest rates on our outstanding variable rate borrowings were to have increased by one percentage point or basis points over the actual rates paid in that year  interest expense would have increased by approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in other factors affecting our financial statements that might result from changes in the economic environment that impact interest rates 
note of the consolidated financial statements sets forth the interest rates related to our current credit facilities 
at october   outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facilities were  and our total indebtedness was million 
foreign currency exchange risk in fiscal  approximately of our sales and service fees  including export sales  were derived from foreign markets 
all of our computerized machine tools and computer control systems  as well as certain proprietary service parts  are sourced by our us based engineering and manufacturing division and re invoiced to our foreign sales and service subsidiaries  primarily in their functional currencies 
our products are sourced from foreign suppliers or built to our specifications by either our wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan  or overseas contract manufacturers 
these purchases are predominantly in foreign currencies and in some cases our arrangements with these suppliers include foreign currency risk sharing agreements  which reduce but do not eliminate the effects of currency fluctuations on product costs 
the predominant portion of our exchange rate risk associated with product purchases relates to the new taiwan dollar 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time to hedge the cash flow risk related to forecast inter company sales and forecast inter company and third party purchases denominated in  or based on  foreign currencies primarily the euro  pound sterling and new taiwan dollar 
we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
forward contracts for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies as of october  which are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
were as follows notional amount weighted avg
