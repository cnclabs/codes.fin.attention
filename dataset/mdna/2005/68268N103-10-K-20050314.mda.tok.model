item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview the partnership s businesses fall into three major business segments the interstate natural gas pipeline segment  which comprises of our assets  the natural gas gathering and processing segment  which comprises of our assets  and the coal slurry pipeline segment  which comprises of our assets 
interstate natural gas pipeline segment in the interstate natural gas pipeline segment  there are several major business drivers 
first  a healthy long term supply outlook for each pipeline is critical 
because the primary source of gas supply for two of our pipeline systems is in the western canadian sedimentary basin  western canadian supply trends are particularly important to this segment 
with strong commodity prices  the current outlook for western canadian supply looks flat for the foreseeable future  however  production has exceeded new reserve additions in recent years 
to maintain an adequate gas supply demand balance in western canada  production will need to grow in the future to meet anticipated demand primarily driven by gas consumption in the extraction and processing associated with canadian oil sands development 
canada holds substantial reserves of bitumen that is extracted from sand and can be upgraded to synthesized crude oil through several processes 
the extraction and processing of bitumen require significant quantities of natural gas 
we do not know how many of the announced oil sands development projects will be approved and constructed but the demand for transportation on our pipeline systems could be affected adversely by the additional competition for canadian gas supply that would result 
the supply outlook may be enhanced over time by developments in the northern frontier with new mackenzie delta supplies reaching the western canadian pipeline grid potentially beginning by the end of this decade and alaskan gas thereafter  although there is no assurance either project will be completed within that timeframe 
moreover  prices of western canadian supply must be competitive with prices from other supply basins that serve our market areas 
if prices are too high  other sources of supply may satisfy demand that otherwise could be met by us 
increased demand for western canadian natural gas in markets other than those served by us may also cause a reduction of demand for service on us 
natural gas markets are also critical to our long term financial performance 
our pipeline systems serve natural gas markets in the upper midwestern area of the united states and access a major market hub in the chicago area 
market growth has been steady with both heating load growth and direct end user growth  such as power plants and ethanol plants for our pipelines 
we charge fees for transportation  which are primarily fixed and based on the amount of capacity reserved for each shipper 
contracting with shippers to reserve the available pipeline capacity as existing contracts expire is a critical factor in our success 
based on contracts in place at december   the percentage of summer design capacity contracted as of december  was for northern border pipeline  for viking gas transmission and and for northbound and southbound transportation  respectively  on midwestern gas transmission 
northern border pipeline recontracting during  northern border pipeline was successful in recontracting  at maximum rates  essentially all of the summer design capacity under contracts that expired on or before november however  most of those contracts were for terms of five to six months so northern border pipeline has a significant amount of capacity  approximately mmcfd or of summer design capacity  under contracts that expire by may  most of this capacity will become available on the pipeline system from port of morgan  montana to the ventura  iowa delivery point 
our objective for northern border pipeline is to recontract the remaining pipeline capacity at maximum transportation rates for the longest terms possible 
because the forward natural gas basis differentials between western canada and northern border pipeline s market centers continue to be less than the total transportation cost at maximum tariff rates  northern border pipeline may again sell a significant portion of this capacity on a short term basis 
so long as we continue to provide economic value  gas likely will flow from western canada over our system and northern border pipeline will maintain its relatively high utilization levels 
however  in any given month  current conditions of weather and storage in supply and market areas may affect the demand for capacity on northern border pipeline 
this could result in lower revenues in some months 
although  we believe a reduction in expected net income and cash flow of approximately million to million is possible  the impact on net income and cash flow may vary outside this range depending on actual natural gas basis differentials experienced during the year 
the composition of natural gas can affect the amount of energy that is transported through a pipeline system 
beginning in  the energy content of natural gas that northern border pipeline receives at the canadian border has declined modestly from  british thermal units btus per cubic foot cf to  btus cf 
northern border pipeline s transportation contracts in conjunction with its tariff define both the volume and equivalent btu value of the gas to be transported 
a reduction in the btu level results in a higher volume of natural gas to be transported to meet an overall equivalent btu value of the gas 
this btu decline that has been experienced was primarily the result of greater processing capacity in alberta 
the change caused northern border pipeline to reduce its available capacity by almost percent to maintain a high standard of system reliability for its customers 
during  the btu level remained near the level of  btus cf and it is expected to remain at that level during this btu variance will be addressed in the november  rate case filing 
northern border pipeline chicago iii expansion in september  northern border pipeline announced sufficient customer support for a proposed expansion of the pipeline system into the chicago market area 
the chicago iii expansion project  with mmcfd of incremental capacity  involves construction of a new  horsepower compressor station in iowa and minor modifications to existing compressor facilities  in iowa and illinois 
capital costs are estimated to be approximately million  and the target in service date is april   subject to timely receipt of regulatory approval 
we anticipate that approximately million of the estimated million capital budget will be expended in  with the remaining million to be spent in midwestern gas transmission eastern extension project we announced on august  that midwestern gas transmission had finalized the necessary contractual commitment to proceed with the eastern extension project 
the project involves the construction of approximately miles of inch diameter pipeline  with a capacity of approximately mmcfd  from portland  tennessee to planned interconnections with columbia gulf transmission company and east tennessee pipeline company 
the project is supported by a precedent agreement with piedmont natural gas company  a local distribution company  for approximately mmcf d for a term of years 
midwestern gas transmission has pre filed with the ferc under the national environmental policy act process 
a scoping meeting was held by the ferc in tennessee on february  there is landowner opposition to the project  which is not unusual for pipeline construction 
midwestern gas transmission is working to keep the affected landowners  the ferc staff and other governmental agencies informed 
pending the receipt of regulatory and other required approvals  the proposed in service date for the project is november and project costs are estimated at approximately million to million with approximately million million to be expended in viking gas transmission recontracting during  viking gas transmission extended contracts of mmcfd at maximum rates with existing shippers for terms ranging from to years  resulting in viking gas transmission being fully contracted until november viking gas transmission has been successful in recontracting of the mmcfd of the expiring capacity at the marshfield  wisconsin delivery point for to year terms at maximum rates in spite of potential competition with anr pipeline company s north leg project scheduled to go into service in we expect other projects may be proposed to further compete for these markets 
we energies  wisconsin power and light company and wisconsin public service corporation are jointly exploring the acquisition of firm natural gas pipeline capacity to accommodate growth and provide greater competition for deliveries to various points along a route from the greater milwaukee area to green bay  wisconsin 
rate case filings and ferc inquiry under the settlement agreement for northern border pipeline s last rate case  it was agreed that northern border pipeline must file a proceeding under section of the natural gas act to determine the just and reasonable rates to be charged for its transportation services 
during the rate case process  the ferc staff and northern border pipeline s customers will review the cost of service elements  including allowed return on capital  operations and maintenance costs  depreciation and taxes and contract demand levels used to determine transportation rates 
also  as required under the order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity  guardian pipeline must file a revenue and cost study by december  as described more fully in item business interstate pipeline regulation  there is a ferc inquiry regarding the proper income tax allowance in rates for regulated entities other than corporations 
in response  a number of comments  including ours  suggested that an income tax allowance is proper for all jurisdictional entities regardless of legal structure 
some producers and customers comments argued against the inclusion of an income tax allowance for partnerships and other non tax paying entities 
it is not certain how  or when  the ferc may proceed with respect to its request for comments or any impact on the rate methodology for our interstate natural gas pipelines which are not corporations 
in particular  northern border pipeline is a general partnership and one of the elements used to determine its cost of service  upon which its transportation rates are derived  is an allowance for income taxes 
while we cannot predict the outcome of the ferc s inquiry  we do believe that northern border pipeline s specific circumstances regarding its tariff  deferred income tax treatment  ferc orders  past history and underlying agreements with shippers are different from those of sfpp  lp the issue of whether northern border pipeline s rates should include an income tax allowance  and if so the amount thereof  may be addressed in northern border pipeline s rate case 
natural gas gathering and processing segment the gas gathering and processing segment accepts delivery of raw gas from natural gas wells at low pressure and gathers that wellhead production to central points where it is processed as necessary and compressed to high pressure for entry into the transmission pipeline grid 
key factors that have an impact on this segment are the pace of reserve development  the decline rate of existing wells  the composition of the raw gas stream being gathered  and the value of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
we charge a fee for this service in the powder river basin 
in the williston basin  we buy the natural gas we gather and then resell the extracted natural gas liquids and residue  retaining a portion of the resale revenues in return for our gathering and processing services 
in some cases  we charge a fee as well 
the producers receive the balance of the proceeds from the resale 
williston basin expansions as a result of increased drilling and development by bear paw energy s customers in the williston basin  bear paw energy has selectively expanded its facilities and expects moderate growth in this area 
the mmcfd expansion of the marmarth plant has been in full operation since february the project enables the plant to produce a higher grade of product by controlling the maximum ethane propane mixture 
also  bear paw energy has expanded the northwest portion of its system to accommodate additional volumes in the bakken oil play 
it is anticipated that as a result of placing these facilities into service in december  an additional mmcfd will be processed by bear paw energy s grasslands processing plant in further expansion in the bakken oil play is expected to bring additional volumes to our system 
powder river basin developments on our wholly owned systems in the powder river basin  gathering volumes have increased since reaching a low point in the first quarter for the full year  average daily volumes gathered on our wholly owned assets in the powder river basin were down compared to  in spite of modest growth in drilling activity and smaller than anticipated well production declines 
certain gathering contracts were renegotiated to mitigate volumetric risk and to reduce operation and maintenance expenses 
in addition  certain non strategic powder river assets were sold during  which resulted in gains totaling million during late in  we also purchased a gathering system that gathers production from approximately  acres 
we hold minority interests in bighorn and fort union  which are trunk gathering systems in the powder river basin 
these businesses are also impacted by the pace of drilling  regulatory issues and declines in upstream areas  however  they are generally more stable in terms of throughput volumes and revenues because they gather gas from larger areas 
also  our ownership in bighorn includes preferred a units  which effectively provide an incentive mechanism to cantera natural gas tied to the number of wells connected to the system 
whether such targets have been met for is under discussion 
we believe that a distribution for the preferred a units is due us for our expected net income and cash flow includes approximately million from this distribution 
sale of gregg lake obed pipeline interest our wholly owned subsidiary  border midstream services sold its undivided minority interest in the gregg lake obed pipeline located in alberta  canada in december for approximately million 
the sale resulted in a million after tax gain 
coal slurry pipeline segment black mesa pipeline company is our coal slurry pipeline 
this pipeline has one major customer  the coal supplier to the mohave generating station  in laughlin  nevada 
this contract on black mesa provides a steady  fee for service  revenue stream through december  after that time  the future is uncertain 
the mohave generating station must complete some significant pollution control investments  and a new water supply for the coal slurry mixture must be established 
in addition  new contracts for the coal supply  must be completed 
we believe that we will be able to negotiate a new contract for black mesa s services  however  we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome 
should these issues be resolved  it appears likely that there would be a temporary shutdown of the mohave generating station and the black mesa pipeline from to we anticipate that the capital expenditures for the black mesa refurbishment project will be in the range of million to million  which will be supported by revenues from a new transportation contract 
under certain circumstances upon the renewal of the transportation contract  we have a contingent obligation to issue common units to prior owners of an interest in black mesa pipeline 
if this obligation is triggered  approximately  to  common units would be issued 
if efforts to resolve the issues surrounding the mohave generating station are not successful and it is permanently closed  it would be necessary to shut down the black mesa pipeline in in the event the mohave generating station permanently closes  estimated shut down costs for black mesa could be in the range of million to million for such expenses as environmental reclamation  severance payments and pension plan funding 
we would also be required to take a non cash charge of approximately million related to goodwill and the remaining undepreciated cost of the assets 
for all of our operations  we have continual focus on reliability for our shippers  safety for the public and our customers  and compliance with regulatory rules and regulations 
in our businesses  these areas are essential 
strategy we are focused on growing our businesses  our income and cash flow and our distributions to unitholders 
our strategy involves three main components 
interstate natural gas pipeline segment first  we will continue to focus on safe  efficient  and reliable operations and the further development of our regulated pipelines 
we intend to maintain our position as a low cost transporter of canadian gas to the midwestern us and provide highly valued services to our customers 
any growth in our interstate pipelines would occur through incremental projects intended to access new markets or supply areas and would be supported by long term contracts 
for northern border pipeline  the marketing of available capacity in a short term contracting environment  filing for and receiving regulatory approvals for the chicago iii expansion and filing the rate case will be priorities for in addition  midwestern gas transmission will focus on receiving regulatory approvals for its eastern extension project and will continue pursuit of expanding existing and developing new interconnections with other interstate pipelines to access new markets 
natural gas gathering and processing segment second  we also are developing our gas gathering and processing segment where we are building on our established business relationships with producers and marketers in the rocky mountain supply basins 
we expect to see continued build out of our gathering systems within the areas of acreage dedications we have secured  particularly in the powder river basin 
depending on the pace of reserve and production development  time associated with regulatory compliance including water discharge permitting  and infrastructure development  we expect growth from new well connections to offset the decline from existing gas wells  resulting in approximately level aggregate gathered volumes on our powder river systems during we are also continuing to pursue different approaches to conducting business in the powder river basin to reduce capital and operating expenditures  improve revenue  and reduce volume and capital recovery risks 
we seek to build extensions to existing facilities on dedicated acreage using lower risk rate structures  expand our gathering network by securing additional acreage dedications  and encourage utilization of existing facilities 
we expect modest growth in gas volumes for our pipelines in the williston basin  reflecting prospects for drilling activity within the bakken oil play production area 
in the williston basin  we seek to build extensions and expansions around our existing facilities and also pursue opportunities to reduce costs and streamline operations 
in addition  we are pursuing new acreage dedications in the basin 
the build out of our existing  and the addition of new  acreage dedications should mitigate production declines and allow further improvement in cost efficiencies 
we will also continue to seek opportunities to mitigate commodity price exposure on the williston basin production 
acquisitions finally  our objective is to continue to acquire profitable and complementary businesses 
our goal is approximately to million of capital expenditures annually in growth through acquisitions and internal development 
we target businesses that leverage our core competencies of energy transportation  are conservative in terms of commodity price risk  are located in the us and canada  and provide immediate earnings and cash flow contribution 
our strategy is to focus on acquisitions of natural gas assets including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines  storage facilities and gathering and processing assets and natural gas liquids pipelines and storage facilities 
we anticipate financing our capital expenditures and acquisitions conservatively through an appropriate mix of additional borrowings and equity issuances 
although we regularly evaluate various acquisition opportunities  we cannot provide assurance that we will reach our goal each year and would also expect that  depending on specific opportunities that develop  acquisitions in some years could significantly exceed our goal stated above 
our ability to maintain and grow our distributions to the unitholders is dependent upon the growth of our existing businesses and or our acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related notes must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
key estimates used by our management include the economic useful lives of our assets used to determine depreciation and amortization  the fair values used to determine possible asset impairment charges  the fair values used to record derivative assets and liabilities  expense accruals  and the fair values of assets acquired 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
certain of our accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others 
the interstate natural gas pipelines accounting policies conform to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
accordingly  certain assets that result from the regulated ratemaking process are recorded that would not be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for nonregulated entities 
we continually assess whether the future recovery of the regulatory assets is probable by considering such factors as regulatory changes and the impact of competition 
if future recovery ceases to be probable  we would be required to write off the regulatory assets at that time 
at december   we have recorded regulatory assets of million  which are being recovered  or expected to be recovered  from the pipelines shippers over varying time periods up to years 
our long lived assets are stated at original cost 
we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of those assets 
useful lives are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in planned use  technological advances or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
the depreciation rate used for utility property is an integral part of the interstate pipelines ferc tariffs 
any revisions to the estimated economic useful lives of our assets will change our depreciation and amortization expense prospectively 
for utility property  no retirement gain or loss is included in income except in the case of retirements or sales of entire operating units 
the original cost of utility property retired is charged to accumulated depreciation and amortization  net of salvage and cost of removal 
we review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the carrying amount of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
estimates of future net cash flows include anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and other estimates 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our accounting for goodwill is in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have selected the fourth quarter for the performance of our annual impairment testing 
as discussed in note  notes to consolidated financial statements  effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred  if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we have  where possible  developed our estimate of the retirement obligations 
the implementation of sfas no 
resulted in an increase in net property  plant and equipment of million  an increase in reserves and deferred credits of million and a reduction to net income of million for the net of tax cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
our accounting for financial instruments is in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement 
at december   the consolidated balance sheet included assets from derivative financial instruments of million 
for our interstate natural gas pipelines  operating revenues are derived from agreements for the receipt and delivery of gas at points along the pipeline system as specified in each shipper s individual transportation contract 
revenues are recognized based upon contracted capacity and actual volumes transported under transportation service agreements 
for our gas gathering and processing businesses  operating revenue is recorded when gas is processed in or transported through company facilities 
for our coal slurry pipeline  operating revenue is recognized based on a contracted demand payment  actual tons transported and direct reimbursement of certain other expenses 
results of operations the following table summarizes financial and other information by business segment for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  operating revenues interstate natural gas pipelines    natural gas gathering and processing    coal slurry    total operating revenues    operating income loss interstate natural gas pipelines    natural gas gathering and processing    coal slurry    other    total operating income loss    income loss from continuing operations interstate natural gas pipelines    natural gas gathering and processing    coal slurry    other    total income loss from continuing operations    discontinued operations  net of tax    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss    following is a detailed analysis of the results of operations for each of our operating segments 
our operating results for reflect the settlement or expected settlement of several outstanding issues related to our past relationship with enron corp 
enron 
our potential obligation for costs related to the termination of enron s cash balance plan was resolved late in  which allowed us to reduce our expenses 
settlement was also reached with enron for certain administrative expenses for and that had been previously estimated  which also reduced our expenses 
we also recorded income in for estimated recovery of bankruptcy claims against the enron estate that we had previously fully reserved 
in december  border midstream sold its undivided minority interest in the gregg lake obed pipeline 
the operating results for border midstream are classified as discontinued operations 
see notes and notes to consolidated financial statements 
our operating results for reflected several significant events 
due to lower throughput volumes experienced and anticipated in our wholly owned subsidiaries in our natural gas gathering and processing business segment  we recorded impairment charges related to goodwill and tangible assets for that segment 
effective january   we acquired all of the common stock of viking gas transmission  including a one third interest in guardian pipeline 
in june  we sold our gladys and mazeppa processing plants located in alberta  canada 
the operating results for these plants are classified as discontinued operations 
finally  as a result of enron s decision to terminate its cash balance plan  we recorded expenses for our expected charges related to the termination of that plan 
see notes  and notes to consolidated financial statements 
our income from continuing operations in was million  per unit  as compared to a loss from continuing operations of million in  per unit  and income from continuing operations of million in  per unit 
our loss in resulted from a million goodwill and asset impairment recorded for our natural gas gathering and processing segment 
excluding the impairment charges  income from continuing operations increased million in as compared to we were advised by northern plains and nbp services  as a result of further evaluation and negotiation of enron s proposed allocation of the termination costs  that no claim of reimbursement for the termination costs of enron s cash balance plan will be made  resulting in a reduction to expense in of million million  net of tax and minority interest 
when compared to the impact of the charges recorded in  this represents a million change to income from continuing operations between and income from continuing operations for also reflects an adjustment to our allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated recoveries of claims against the enron estate of million million  net of minority interest and a gain on sale of two of bear paw energy s gathering systems and other compressor equipment of million 
excluding the impairment charges  income from continuing operations increased million in as compared to  which reflects income from viking gas transmission of million  lower interest expense for northern border pipeline of million million impact on continuing operations after minority interest due to a decrease in average interest rates as well as a decrease in average debt outstanding  a million special income allocation related to a cash distribution from our preferred a interest in bighorn gas gathering and a million payment received for a change in ownership of the other partner in bighorn gas gathering 
these increases to income were partially offset by charges associated with the termination of enron s cash balance plan of million million  net of tax and minority interest 
the calculation of per unit income loss was also impacted by our issuance of additional partnership interests in may and june our consolidated income statement reflects income from discontinued operations of million in  million in and million in discontinued operations for include an after tax gain of million on the sale of the undivided interest in the gregg lake obed pipeline 
discontinued operations for include an after tax gain of million on the sale of the gladys and mazeppa processing plants 
the consolidated income statement also reflects a reduction to net income of million due to a net of tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  which resulted from adopting sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
interstate natural gas pipeline segment our interstate natural gas pipeline segment reported income of million in  million in and million in the increase in income from primarily relates to an increase in northern border pipeline s revenues by million million net impact to income after minority interests  a decrease in northern border pipeline s operations and maintenance expense by million million net impact to income after minority interests and a decrease in northern border pipeline s interest expense by million million net impact to income after minority interests 
the increase in income from primarily resulted from our acquisition of viking gas transmission on january   and lower interest expense for northern border pipeline 
viking gas transmission s income for totaled million and northern border pipeline s interest expense decreased by million million net impact to income after minority interests 
operating revenues for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment were million in  million in and million in the increase in operating revenues in over resulted from an increase in northern border pipeline s revenues of million  an increase in viking gas transmission revenues of million and an increase in midwestern gas transmission revenues of million 
due to the expiration of conditions under northern border pipeline s previous rate case settlement  it was able to generate and retain approximately million from the sale of short term firm capacity and approximately million due to no longer being required to share new service revenue with its shippers 
the remaining increase of million resulted from an additional day of transportation services due to leap year 
viking gas transmission s revenue was higher in primarily because does not reflect revenue prior to the january  acquisition date 
midwestern gas transmission s revenue increased primarily due to operational sales of gas 
the increase in operating revenues in over resulted from viking gas transmission revenues of million  an increase in midwestern gas transmission revenues of million and an increase in northern border pipeline s revenues of million 
midwestern gas transmission s revenues in reflect an increase in contracted capacity as compared to the same period in northern border pipeline s revenues for were affected by million of uncollected revenues associated with the transportation capacity formerly held by ena  which filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in december see the impact of enron s chapter filing on our business 
operations and maintenance expenses for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment were million in  million in and million in the decrease in expenses from to primarily resulted from a decrease in northern border pipeline s and midwestern gas transmission s expense by million and million  respectively 
in  northern border pipeline and midwestern gas transmission reduced expenses by million for adjustments to their accruals for estimated charges resulting from the termination of enron s cash balance plan 
additionally in  the interstate natural gas pipelines reduced their operations and maintenance expense by approximately million related to the settlement of previously accrued charges for administrative services provided by northern plains  the pipelines operator  and its affiliates 
also contributing to the decrease were adjustments made to our allowance for doubtful accounts of million for estimated recoveries of claims against enron 
expense was increased by million related to costs incurred as part of our comprehensive effort to ensure compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in expenses in over resulted from viking gas transmission s expense of million and an increase in northern border pipeline s expense and midwestern gas transmission s expense by a combined million 
this increase primarily related to the estimated charges for termination of enron s cash balance plan of million 
northern border pipeline s expenses in reflected a million accrual for costs related to the treatment of previously collected quantities of natural gas used in utility operations to cover electric power costs see footnote notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
in february  northern border pipeline filed to amend its ferc tariff to clarify the definition of company use gas  which is gas supplied by its shippers for its operations 
northern border pipeline had included in its retention of company use gas  quantities that were equivalent to the cost of electric power at its electric driven compressor stations during the period of june through january on march   the ferc issued an order rejecting northern border pipeline s proposed tariff sheet revision and requiring refunds with interest within days of the order 
northern border pipeline made refunds to its shippers of million in may depreciation and amortization expenses for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment were million in  million in and million in the increase between and is primarily a result of assets that viking gas transmission had placed in service in the fourth quarter of the increase between and is primarily due to the acquisition of viking gas transmission in january taxes other than income for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment were million in  million in and million in the increase in from is primarily due to viking gas transmission expenses of million and a million increase in northern border pipeline s expense 
northern border pipeline s expense reflected a refund of use taxes previously paid on exempt purchases 
interest expense for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment was million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in from was primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding for northern border pipeline partially offset by an increase in average interest rates 
northern border pipeline s interest expense decreased million in from due to a decrease in average interest rates as well as a decrease in average debt outstanding 
the expense included million for viking gas transmission 
other income  net for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment was million in  million in and million in significant items included in the million increase between and are additional income of approximately million for pipeline interconnections constructed partially offset by million of bad debt expense 
the decrease from to relates to a million expense for northern border pipeline s repayment of amounts received in for previously vacated microwave frequency bands 
equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment were million in and million in  which represents earnings from our one third interest in guardian pipeline 
the decrease in equity earnings was primarily due to higher depreciation expense as well as higher administrative expenses for guardian pipeline 
minority interests in net income  which represent the minority interest in northern border pipeline  were million for  million for and million for the increases in and from prior year results were due to increased net income for northern border pipeline 
income tax expense for our interstate natural gas pipeline segment was million in and million in as compared to an income tax benefit of million in the and amounts included viking gas transmission income taxes of million 
the remaining income tax amounts relate to midwestern gas transmission  which increased million from to due to an increase in income before income taxes 
natural gas gathering and processing segment our natural gas gathering and processing segment reported income from continuing operations of million in  a loss from continuing operations of million in and income from continuing operations of million in the segment recorded impairment charges of million in see note notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
excluding the effect of the impairment charges  the segment s income from continuing operations increased million between and primarily due to a reduction to expense of million for the adjustment to an accrual made in for estimated charges resulting from the termination of enron s cash balance plan resulting in a decrease between years of million  a gain on sale of two gathering systems and other compressor equipment of million and the adjustment to our allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated recoveries of claims against enron of million 
excluding the effect of the impairment charges  the segment s income from continuing operations for and was relatively unchanged 
operating revenues for our natural gas gathering and processing segment were million in  million in and million in the increase in revenues in over reflects an increase in realized prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids and increased gathering and processing volumes in the williston basin  which accounted for million of the revenue increase  partially offset by lower gathering volumes in the powder river basin  which decreased revenues by million 
the increase in over is due to an increase in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices  which accounted for million of the overall increase  partially offset by lower volumes gathered in the powder river basin  which decreased revenues million 
product purchases for our natural gas gathering and processing segment were million in  million in and million in under certain gathering and processing agreements in the williston basin  bear paw energy purchases raw natural gas from producers at a price tied to a percentage of the price for which it sells extracted natural gas liquids and residue gas 
total revenues from the sale of these products are included in operating revenues 
amounts paid to the producers to purchase their raw natural gas are reflected in product purchases 
the increase in product purchases in over is due to an increase in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices and increased gathering and processing volumes 
the increase in over is due to an increase in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices 
operations and maintenance expenses for our natural gas gathering and processing segment were million in  million in and million in the reduction in from was due to several factors 
the amount includes a million gain on sale of two gathering systems and other compressor equipment 
in addition  the decrease in expense was due to the segment recording a million estimated recovery of previously recorded bad debts 
expense for was also reduced by million for the adjustment to the accrual made in for estimated charges resulting from the termination of enron s cash balance plan 
partially offsetting these decreases to expense were higher fuel costs of million and expenses incurred as a result of the marmarth plant expansion  which went into service in employee benefits expenses for increased million as compared to  which included million of charges associated with the termination of enron s cash balance plan 
for our natural gas gathering and processing segment  depreciation and amortization expenses  excluding the impairment charge recorded in  were million in  million in and million in as a result of the goodwill and asset impairment analysis  we decided to shorten the useful life of our low pressure gas gathering assets in the powder river basin from to years  which increased our depreciation expense by million for this segment in and by million in other income  net from our natural gas gathering and processing segment was million in  million in and million in the increase in other income for is primarily due a million payment received for a change in ownership of the other partner in bighorn gas gathering and a million refund from an electric cooperative 
equity earnings from our unconsolidated affiliates were million in  million in and million in the and equity earnings include million and million from a special income allocation related to a cash distribution from our preferred a interest in bighorn gas gathering 
this distribution  determined in accordance with the joint venture agreement  was based on the number of wells connected to the gathering system in the preceding year 
if certain targets are not met  we receive a disproportionate share of cash distributions 
coal slurry pipeline segment our coal slurry pipeline segment reported income from continuing operations of million in on revenues of million  income of million in on revenues of million and income of million in on revenues of million 
the million decrease in income from continuing operations between and was primarily due to higher depreciation expense of million million impact after income taxes partially offset by an increase in revenue by million million impact after income taxes 
depreciation and amortization expense for the coal slurry pipeline was million in as compared to million in and million in the partnership determined it was appropriate to shorten the useful life of certain of its coal slurry assets to correspond with the expiration of the existing coal slurry transportation agreement in the increase in revenues in is primarily related to an increase in billing rates and an increase in tons of coal shipped 
other items not attributable to any segment include certain of our general and administrative expenses  interest expense on our debt and other income and expense items 
our general and administrative expenses not allocated to any segment were million in  million in and million in the increase in expense between and was primarily related to increased insurance costs of million  million of costs incurred as part of our comprehensive effort to ensure compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and million of additional business development expenditures partially offset by a reduction to expense of million for the adjustment to an accrual made in for estimated charges resulting from the termination of enron s cash balance plan resulting in a decrease between years of million and a million reduction related to the settlement of previously accrued charges for administrative services provided by northern plains and its affiliates 
the expense included million for the termination of the enron cash balance plan  an increase in insurance expense by million due to an increase in liability premiums and additional business development expenditures of million 
interest expense on our debt was million in  million in and million in the increase in expense for from was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding partially offset by a decrease in average interest rates

we have guaranteed the performance of certain of our unconsolidated affiliates in connection with their credit agreements that expire in march and september collectively at december   the amount of both guarantees was million 
overview we believe that we have adequate liquidity to fund future recurring operating activities and investments 
short term liquidity needs will be met by our operating cash flows and our current or similar new credit facilities discussed below 
other liquidity needs are expected to be funded through the issuance of long term debt as well as additional limited partner interests 
our ability to complete future debt and equity offerings and the timing of any such offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates and our financial condition and credit ratings at the time 
credit facilities the partnership and northern border pipeline have entered into revolving credit facilities  which are used for refinancing existing indebtedness  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general business purposes 
we entered into a million four year revolving credit agreement partnership credit agreement with certain financial institutions in november northern border pipeline entered into a million three year credit agreement pipeline credit agreement with certain financial institutions in may at december   million was outstanding under the partnership credit agreement at an average interest rate of 
there were no amounts outstanding under the pipeline credit agreement at december  with the pipeline credit agreement due to expire in may  northern border pipeline has commenced discussions with financial institutions and expects to have a new credit agreement in place at terms and conditions similar to its current agreement 
each of the partnership credit agreement and the pipeline credit agreement requires the partnership and northern border pipeline to maintain compliance with certain financial  operational and legal covenants 
the partnership credit agreement and pipeline credit agreement require the partnership and northern border pipeline to maintain ratios of ebitda net income plus minority interests in net income  interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization to interest expense of greater than to the credit agreements also require the maintenance of the ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ebitda adjusted for pro forma operating results of acquisitions made during the year of no more than to under the partnership credit agreement  if we consummate one or more acquisitions in which the aggregate purchase price is million or more  the allowable ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda is temporarily increased to to at december   the partnership and northern border pipeline were in compliance with the covenants of our credit agreements 
the interest rate applied to amounts outstanding under these agreements may  as selected by us and by northern border pipeline  be either the lender s base rate or libor plus a spread that is based upon the long term unsecured debt ratings in effect for us and for northern border pipeline 
debt securities in april  northern border pipeline completed a private offering of million of senior notes due pipeline senior notes 
the proceeds from the pipeline senior notes were used to reduce indebtedness outstanding 
in december  northern border pipeline redeemed million of the pipeline senior notes 
the indentures under which the pipeline senior notes were issued do not limit the amount of unsecured debt northern border pipeline may incur  but they do contain material financial covenants  including restrictions on incurrence of secured indebtedness 
the indentures under which the partnership senior notes were issued do not limit the amount of unsecured debt we may incur  but they do contain material financial covenants  including restrictions on incurrence  assumption or guarantee of secured indebtedness

at december   viking gas transmission has four series of senior notes outstanding 
in november  viking gas transmission amended the indenture on its senior notes 
prior to the amendment  viking gas transmission made monthly principal and interest payments on the four series of notes 
as a result of the amendment  three of the series of senior notes due between and require payment of interest quarterly and payment of principal at maturity 
the senior notes due in continue to require monthly principal and interest payments 
under the previous indenture  viking gas transmission s transportation contracts were pledged as security for payment  which has been replaced in the current indenture by a guarantee by the partnership 
in addition  viking gas transmission is no longer required to maintain debt service funds on deposit 
at december   the requirement for accumulation of debt service funds was million 
hedging activity in  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million in anticipation of a ten year fixed rate senior notes issuance to be placed in the first half of the interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges as they hedge the fluctuations in treasury rates and spreads between the execution date of the swaps and the issuance of the fixed rate debt 
we expect to use the proceeds from the senior note issuance to repay amounts borrowed under the partnership credit agreement 
we currently have outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million that expire in march under the interest rate swap agreements  we make payments to counterparties at variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate and in return receive payments based on a fixed rate 
at december   the average effective interest rate on our interest rate swap agreements was 
equity issuances in may and june  we sold  and  common units  respectively 
in july  we sold  common units 
in conjunction with the issuance of additional common units  our general partners are required to make capital contributions to maintain a general partner interest in accordance with the partnership agreements

cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million in  million in and million in the increase in operating revenues and lower interest expense in as compared to contributed to the increase in operating cash flow 
these increases were partially offset by higher product purchases and a million decrease in distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates 
other cash flows from operating activities for reflect northern border pipeline s initial payment of million to the fort peck tribes  in accordance with the terms of the agreement  and an inflow of million for funds that viking gas transmission was previously required to keep on deposit for debt service 
the decrease from to is primarily due to northern border pipeline s refund to its shippers for million see note notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
operating cash flows were also decreased due to payments made to nbp services and northern plains for administrative services provided prior to and due to a reduction in prepayments in that northern border pipeline had required certain shippers make in for transportation service 
distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates increased million to million  primarily due to distributions received from bighorn gas gathering related to our preferred a interest discussed previously

the impact of enron s chapter filing on our business on december   enron filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
certain wholly owned enron subsidiaries also filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on december  and thereafter 
until november   each of northern plains and pan border  two of our general partners  were subsidiaries of enron 
northern plains and pan border were not among the enron companies who filed for chapter protection 
sale of enron entities on march   enron transferred its ownership interest in northern plains  pan border and nbp services to crosscountry energy  llc crosscountry 
in addition  crosscountry and enron entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which enron would provide to crosscountry  on an interim  transitional basis  various services  including but not limited to i information technology services  ii accounting system usage rights and administrative support and iii payroll  employee benefits and administrative services 
in turn  these services are provided to us and our subsidiaries through northern plains and nbp services 
on june   enron announced that it had reached an agreement with a joint venture of southern union company and ge commercial finance energy financial services cce holdings for the sale of crosscountry 
on september   enron announced that it reached an amended agreement for the sale of crosscountry to cce holdings cce holdings agreement 
on september   the bankruptcy court issued an order the september order approving the cce holdings agreement 
on september   southern union company and oneok  inc each announced that oneok had entered into an agreement oneok agreement to purchase northern plains  pan border and nbp services collectively the transfer group companies from cce holdings 
this acquisition closed on november  under the cce holdings agreement  enron agreed to extend certain of the terms of the transition services agreement and transition services supplemental agreement between crosscountry and enron together the tsa for a period of six months from the closing date 
as part of the closing  oneok and cce holdings entered a transition services agreement referred to as the northern border transition services agreement covering certain transition services by and among oneok  cce holdings and enron for a period of six months 
certain of the services previously provided by enron are now being provided through oneok 
as services are transitioned to northern plains  nbp services or oneok  it is possible that additional costs for computer hardware  software and personnel may result 
the costs estimated to date do not appear to be materially greater than the costs incurred in the past by northern plains and nbp services from enron and crosscountry 
pension liability on december   enron filed a motion seeking approval of the bankruptcy court to provide additional funding to  and for authority to terminate  the enron corp 
cash balance plan cash balance plan and certain other defined benefit plans of enron s affiliates collectively the plans in standard terminations within the meaning of section of the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
on january   the bankruptcy court entered an order authorizing the termination  additional funding and other actions necessary to effect the relief requested 
pursuant to the bankruptcy court order  any contributions to the plans are subject to the prior receipt of a favorable determination by the internal revenue service that the plans are tax qualified as of their respective dates of termination 
on july   enron was served with a complaint filed by the pension benefits guaranty corporation pbgc in the district court for the southern district of texas against enron as the sponsor and or administrator of the plans the action 
by filing the action  the pbgc is seeking an order i terminating the plans  ii appointing the pbgc the statutory trustee of the plans  iii requiring transfer to the pbgc of all records  assets or other property of the plans required to determine the benefits payable to the plans participants  and iv establishing june  as the termination date of the plans 
in the bankruptcy court september order  enron was authorized to enter into an escrow agreement with cce holdings and pbgc 
upon closing  enron deposited the amount of million to an escrow account  which is intended to ensure that none of cce holdings or its affiliates are exposed to liability to the pbgc under title iv of the employee retirement income security act of  as amended  for which cce holdings may otherwise be indemnified pursuant to the cce holdings agreement 
in addition  the form of escrow agreement approved pursuant to the september order provides that  under certain circumstances and upon approval by or notice to the parties to the escrow agreement  some or all of the funds placed in escrow may be paid directly in respect of the cash balance plan to the pbgc 
however  the september order also provides that pbgc retains any rights or claims it may have against the transfer group companies 
enron management previously informed northern plains and nbp services that enron would seek funding contributions from each member of its erisa controlled group of corporations that employs  or employed  individuals who are  or were  covered under the cash balance plan 
northern plains and nbp services are considered members of enron s erisa controlled group of corporations 
as of december   the amount of approximately million was estimated for northern plains and nbp services proportionate share of the up to million estimated termination costs for the plans authorized by the bankruptcy court order 
since under the operating agreement with northern plains and the administrative agreement with nbp services  these costs could be our responsibility  we accrued million to satisfy claims of reimbursement for these termination costs 
as a result of further evaluation and negotiation of enron s proposed allocation of the termination costs  northern plains and nbp services advised us that no claim of reimbursement for the termination costs will be made  resulting in a reduction in reserves during of million for the termination costs 
under the oneok agreement  neither northern plains nor nbp services nor the partnership will be required to contribute to or otherwise be liable for any contributions to enron in connection with the cash balance plan 
the purchase price under the agreements will be deemed to include all contributions which otherwise would have been allocable to northern plains and nbp services 
claims filed in bankruptcy at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition  we had a number of contractual relationships with enron and its subsidiaries 
on july   the bankruptcy court approved the amended joint chapter plan and related disclosure statement chapter plan 
under the approved chapter plan  assuming the previously announced sale of portland general electric is consummated  enron creditors  which should include subsidiaries of the partnership as general unsecured creditors  will receive a combination of cash and equity of prisma energy international  enron s international energy asset business 
we have previously fully reserved our claims against enron 
ena  a wholly owned subsidiary of enron that is in bankruptcy  was a party to transportation contracts  which obligated ena to pay for of northern border pipeline s capacity 
through the bankruptcy proceeding in  ena rejected and terminated all of its firm transportation contracts on northern border pipeline 
since enron guaranteed the obligations of ena under those contracts  northern border pipeline filed claims against both ena and enron for damages in the bankruptcy proceedings 
as a result of a settlement agreement between ena  enron and northern border pipeline  each of ena and enron have agreed to allow northern border pipeline s claim of approximately million 
the settlement agreement is expected to be presented to the bankruptcy court for approval in march based upon this settlement between the parties  at december  northern border pipeline adjusted its allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect an estimated recovery of million for this claim 
ena was also a party to a transportation contract for capacity on midwestern gas transmission 
ena rejected and terminated this contract in november midwestern gas transmission filed claims against ena for breach of contract and other claims 
however  this claim of approximately thousand was denied 
in addition  bear paw energy filed claims against ena relating to terminated swap agreements 
in accordance with sfas no 
in bear paw energy ceased to account for these swap agreements as hedge transactions 
bear paw energy had previously recorded approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these agreements  which is being recorded into earnings in the same periods of the originally forecasted hedges 
during the third quarter  the bankruptcy court approved a settlement between bear paw energy  enron and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries of bear paw energy s claim for commodity hedges 
as a result  we adjusted our allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect an estimated million recovery for this claim 
also  crestone energy ventures filed claims against ena for unpaid gas gathering and administrative services fees in the amount of approximately million 
as a result of a settlement agreement between ena and crestone energy ventures  ena has agreed to allow crestone energy ventures claim of approximately million 
the settlement agreement is expected to be presented to the bankruptcy court for approval in march based upon this settlement between the parties  an adjustment of million was made to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate that we could recognize  through future operating results  additional recoveries of million to million for the claims in the enron bankruptcy proceedings 
however  there can be no assurances on the amounts actually recovered or timing of distributions under the chapter plan 
veba trust enron is the grantor of the enron gas pipeline employee benefit trust the trust  which when taken together with the enron corp 
medical plan for inactive participants the medical plan constitutes a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba under section c of the internal revenue code 
in october  northern plains was advised that enron had notified the committee that has administrative and fiduciary oversight related to the trust and the medical plan  that enron had made the determination to begin necessary steps to partition the assets of the trust and the related liabilities of the medical plan among all of the participating employers of the trust 
the trust was established as a regulatory requirement for inclusion of certain costs for post employment medical benefits in the rates established for the affected pipelines  including northern border pipeline 
enron requested the enrolled actuary to prepare an analysis and recommendation for the allocation of the trust s assets and associated liabilities among all the participating employers 
on july   enron sought approval of the bankruptcy court to terminate the trust and to distribute its assets among certain identified pipeline companies  one being northern plains 
if enron s relief would have been granted as requested  northern plains would have assumed retiree benefit liabilities  estimated as of june   of million with an asset allocation of million 
an objection to the motion was filed 
an additional actuary has been engaged by enron to review the analysis and recommendations for allocations 
the results of that review have not been provided to northern plains 
it is anticipated that a new motion will be filed and that the allocation of liabilities and assets will change from those set forth in the prior motion 
we do not  however  believe that those changes will be material

forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance 
they involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the future results of our operations may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements include the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the impact of enron s chapter filing on our business  the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  and the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
although we believe that our expectations regarding future events are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business  we cannot assure you that our goals will be achieved or that our expectations regarding future developments will be realized 
with this in mind  you should consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements any customer s failure to perform its contractual obligations could adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition 
some of our shippers or their owners have experienced a deterioration of their financial condition 
should one or more file for bankruptcy protection  our ability to recover amounts owed or to resell the capacity would be impacted 
since northern plains  the interstate natural gas pipelines operator  and nbp services  administrator for us  are transitioning services from enron and crosscountry  northern plains and nbp services may be unable to perform certain services under their agreements or may incur increases in costs to continue or replace the services 
contracts on our interstate pipelines will expire during the year with significant expirations in april and october 
on northern border pipeline  those contracts represent approximately of its summer design capacity 
the interstate pipelines ability to recontract capacity as existing contracts terminate for maximum transportation rates will be subject to a number of factors including availability of natural gas supplies from the western canadian sedimentary basin  the demand for natural gas in our market areas and the basis differential between the receipt and delivery points on our system 
northern border pipeline may have to contract for shorter terms or at less than maximum rates 
see overview above and item business interstate pipelines demand for transportation capacity 
our interstate pipelines are subject to extensive regulation by the ferc governing all aspects of our business  including our transportation rates 
under northern border pipeline s rate case settlement  neither northern border pipeline nor its existing customers can seek rate changes to its settlement base rates until november  at which time northern border pipeline is obligated to file a rate case 
we cannot predict what challenges our interstate pipelines may have to their rates in the future 
see item business interstate pipelines ferc regulation 
in the event that the ferc ultimately determines that interstate natural gas pipelines that are partnerships are not entitled to an allowance for income tax in their rates and northern border pipeline is unsuccessful in its arguments regarding its facts and circumstances  the disallowance of this component of cost of service for rates in northern border pipeline could be materially adverse to us 
see item business interstate pipelines ferc regulation 
in a rate case proceeding setting the maximum rates that may be charged  our interstate pipeline systems are generally allowed the opportunity to collect from their customers a return on their assets or rate base as reflected in their financial records as well as recover that rate base through depreciation 
the amount they may collect from customers  as a result of a subsequent rate case  decreases as the rate base declines as a result of  depreciation and amortization 
in order to avoid a reduction in the level of cash available for distributions to its owners  in the event of a future rate case  each of these pipelines must maintain or increase its rate base through projects that maintain or add to existing pipeline facilities or increase its rate of return 
conflicts of interest may arise between our general partners and their affiliates on one hand  and us on the other hand 
as a result of these conflicts  the general partners may favor their own interests and the interests of their affiliates over the interests of our limited partners 
we face competition from third parties in our natural gas transportation  gathering and processing businesses 
see item business interstate pipeline competition and business interstate pipelines future demand and competition 
our operations are subject to federal and state agencies for environmental protection and operational safety 
we may incur substantial costs and liabilities in the future as a result of stricter environmental and safety laws  regulations and enforcement policies 
see item business environmental and safety matters 
northern border pipeline expects to seek rate recovery of its costs associated with the settlement of pipeline right of way lease and taxation issues with the fort peck tribes 
if northern border pipeline is unable to recover these settlement costs in rates  it will be required to expense costs previously deferred as regulatory assets 
see item legal proceedings 
black mesa s contract to transport coal slurry terminates in december if black mesa is unable to extend or enter into a new arrangement for transportation of coal slurry  black mesa could incur costs and expenses for employee related matters  a write off of recorded goodwill and removal of certain facilities 
see item business coal slurry pipeline and overview above 
part of our business strategy is to expand existing assets and acquire additional assets and businesses that will allow us to increase our cash flow and distributions to unitholders 
unexpected costs or challenges may arise whenever we acquire new assets or businesses 
successful acquisitions require management and other personnel to devote significant amounts of time to new businesses or integrating the acquired assets with existing businesses 
our ability to maintain and or expand our midstream gas gathering business will depend in large part on the pace of drilling and production activity in the powder river  wind river and williston basins 
drilling and production activity will be impacted by a number of factors beyond our control  including demand for and prices of natural gas and refinery grade crude oil  producer response to the eis  reserve performance  the ability of producers to obtain necessary permits and capacity constraints on natural gas transmission pipelines that transport gas from the producing areas 
see item business natural gas gathering and processing segment future demand and competition 
our financial performance will depend on our ability to successfully manage business operations to further reduce operating expenditures and volume and capital recovery risks in the powder river basin operations 
initiatives by states to regulate the rates that we charge for our gathering and processing of natural gas and or to assess taxes on certain aspects of our gas gathering and processing and interstate pipeline businesses may adversely impact us 
the impact of changing quality of natural gas received into our gathering and processing facilities may adversely affect our revenues and operations 
in particular  the energy content of our gathered powder river basin production during was approximately btus cf 
most natural gas quality standards of interstate pipelines require a minimum of btus cf 
if we are unable to blend customers gas  additional treatment may be necessary to avoid curtailment of certain volumes 
although our business strategy is to pursue fee based and fixed rate contracts  some of our gas processing facilities are subject to certain contracts that give us quantities of natural gas liquids and residue gas as payment of our processing services 
the income and cash flow from these contracts will be impacted directly by changes in these commodity prices 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
we may need new capital to finance future acquisitions and expansions 
if our access to capital is limited  this will impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 
as we acquire new businesses and make additional investments in existing businesses  we may need to increase borrowings and issue additional equity in order to maintain an appropriate capital structure 
this may be dilutive to our unitholders and impact the market value of our common units 
see liquidity and capital resources debt and credit facilities and issuance of common units above 
our indentures contain provisions that would require us to offer to repurchase our senior notes if moodys or standard poor s rating services rate our notes below investment grade 
see liquidity and capital resources debt and credit facilities and issuance of common units above 
we may be adversely impacted by the potential enactment of legislation in various states to modify existing provisions for income tax withholding on partners distributions 
under current law  we are treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and do not pay any income tax at the entity level 
in order to qualify for this treatment  we must derive more than of our annual gross income from specified investments and activities 
while we believe that we currently do qualify and intend to meet this income requirement  if we should fail  we would be treated as if we were a newly formed corporation and the income we generate from the date of such failure would be subject to corporate income tax 
because the tax would be imposed on us  the cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced 
in addition  the entire amount of cash received by each unitholder would generally be taxed as a corporate dividend when received 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  use  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available to pay distributions would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be decreased to reflect that impact on us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us  or risks that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations 
any of the risk factors described above could significantly and adversely impair our operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
a control environment has been established which includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of financial instrument activities 
we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize financial instruments in the management of interest rate risks and our natural gas and natural gas liquids marketing activities to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to interest rate and price fluctuations 
we do not use these instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk our interest rate exposure results from variable rate borrowings from commercial banks 
to mitigate potential fluctuations in interest rates  we attempt to maintain a significant portion of our consolidated debt portfolio in fixed rate debt 
we also use interest rate swaps as a means to manage interest expense by converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt to take advantage of declining interest rates 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding  million of which was previously fixed rate debt that had been converted to variable rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps 
as of december   approximately of our debt portfolio was in fixed rate debt 
see notes and notes to consolidated financial statements 
if average interest rates change by one percent compared to rates in effect as of december   consolidated annual interest expense would change by approximately million 
this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate borrowings outstanding as of december  commodity price risk bear paw energy is subject to certain contracts that give it quantities of natural gas and natural gas liquids as partial consideration for processing services
