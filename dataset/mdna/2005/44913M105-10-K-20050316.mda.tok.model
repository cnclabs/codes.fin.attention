issuer purchases of equity securities we announced a stock repurchase plan on august  under the terms of the plan  we are authorized to purchase up to million of our common stock 
there were no purchases made pursuant to the plan during the year ended december  since august   we have repurchased  shares of our stock at an average price of per share 
item selected financial data the following table contains selected consolidated financial data for the five years ended december   derived from our audited consolidated financial statements

restructuring charges in cost of sales include million related to the write down of inventories and other related costs 
restructuring charges of million  which are separately stated  include million related to the write down of a building and other fixed assets to their estimated fair value and million related to termination costs and other charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the second quarter  we recorded an million charge to cost of revenue to write off all costs previously deferred under our long term contract with the brazilian health ministry 
our decision was principally due to the lack of timely acknowledgement and acceptance of the pending claim  the expiration of the contract during april and the delay in the negotiation of the extension of the maintenance element of the contract 
we believe that the delay was due to an internal scandal within the brazilian health ministry  which in no way relates to hypercom or our pending claim  but nevertheless  cast doubt and concern over the ability to recover  timely  the amounts owed under the contract 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  we wrote off our remaining million investment in cirilium corporation cirilium  a joint corporate venture that we had formed in late with inter tel inc through september   we had accounted for our investment in cirilium on the equity method and had reported million in losses in connection with this investment 
this write off and the reporting of these losses  in the total amount of million  contributed to our net loss for the year ended december  during  we recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the early retirement of two term loans 
the loss resulted from the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a loan discount associated with our term loans 
during  we increased the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by million  of which million contributed to our loss before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and million was recorded in discontinued operations related to golden eagle leasing for the period ending december  during september  we identified certain unprofitable businesses and  effective with the decision to hold these operating units for sale  recorded a loss of million to write down the assets to their estimated fair value 
for comparative purposes  all prior operating results of these unprofitable businesses have been reclassified to reflect the results of operations in discontinued operations 
during  we completed the disposition of all remaining operating units identified and initially held for sale in september in connection with the disposition of these operating units  we recorded a loss on sale of the units totaling million during comprised of a million cash infusion made by us in accordance with the terms of the sale  non cash inventory and fixed asset write downs of million  severance costs of million  the write off of million in uncollectible accounts receivable  and facility lease and other exit costs of million 
consistent with our strategy of disposing of operating units not aligned with its core business  we sold our direct finance lease subsidiary  golden eagle leasing  effective october   for million gross cash proceeds  and recorded a million gain net of severance and other exit costs 
as a result of the disposition  the net operating results of golden eagle leasing have been reported within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
during  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the transition provisions of sfas  we evaluated our reporting units for impairment of goodwill and recorded a million write off primarily attributable to goodwill associated with the acquisition of golden eagle leasing 
certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
for a presentation of certain of the above information on a quarterly basis for each of our four quarters refer to note of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following sets forth a discussion and analysis of hypercom corporation s financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in exhibit of this annual report on form k entitled cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and risk factors  in the discussion below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  long term contracts  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  foreign currency  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue and accounts receivable we recognize revenue for product sales pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
and no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab and which is generally upon delivery of product 
although we comply with the requirements of sab and upon shipment of product and the recording of revenue  we continually evaluate our accounts receivable for any bad debts or product returns and make estimates for any bad debt allowances or product return reserves as the specific situations dictate 
we generally recognize services revenue when services have been provided and collection of invoiced amounts is reasonably assured 
amounts received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue 
operating lease revenue is recognized monthly over the lease term 
the cost of units leased under operating leases are included in our balance sheet under property  plant and equipment 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we compute such allowance based upon a specific customer account review of our larger customers and balances in excess of days old 
our assessment of our customers ability to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  investigation into our customers financial status  as well as consideration of our customers payment history with us 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if we determine  based on our assessment  that it is more likely than not that our customers will be unable to pay  we will charge off the accounts receivable 
for balances less than days old and customers not large enough to warrant a specific review  we record an allowance based on set percentages depending upon the age of the respective accounts receivable balance 
we record reductions to revenue based on estimates of product returns 
the estimate of product returns is based on historical return trends as well as our assessment of individual customer orders and shipments 
such returns can result from customer nonpayment  in which we request that our product be returned  or a decision on the part of the customer to return the product 
sales type leases certain sales of product are sold under a capital lease arrangement  recorded as a sales type lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
sales type lease revenues consist of the initial sale of the product shipped and the interest and maintenance elements of the lease payments as they are earned 
we maintain an allowance for estimated uncollectible sales type lease receivables at an amount that we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our sales type lease portfolio 
our allowance is determined principally on the basis of historical loss experience and management s assessment of the credit quality of the sales type lease customer base 
if loss rates increase or credit conditions at our customers deteriorate  we may need to increase our allowance for uncollectible sales type leases 
in addition  as part of the initial recording of our sales type leases  we estimate the unguaranteed residual value of the equipment 
this is the estimated fair value of the equipment that will be returned to or purchased from us at the end of the initial lease period 
our estimate of the residual value is based on industry standards and our actual experience 
if market conditions change negatively  it could have an adverse impact on the estimated residual value amount 
long term contract revenue we recognize revenues and an estimated gross profit on long term contracts upon the attainment of scheduled performance milestones under the percentage of completion method 
we follow this method since contracts contain well defined performance milestones and we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of the contract 
during  the final maintenance phase of our only long term contract expired 
we recorded an million charge in to write off all deferred contract costs previously recorded on this contract 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
inventory we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  adjusted for absorption of manufacturing variances  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
for purposes of our inventory lower of cost or market lcm calculations  we classify inventory into three categories fully saleable  slow moving and potentially obsolete 
we do not record any write down for fully saleable inventory 
inventory not expected to be sold within the upcoming month period  based upon future demand assumptions  is considered slow moving and written down based upon the projected sell through period 
we write down potentially obsolete inventory to estimated salvage value  if any 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes during  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our then remaining unreserved deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of a continued economic downturn on our estimated us sourced future income 
since  we have continued to fully reserve for all deferred tax balances 
as a result  there are no remaining unreserved balances of deferred tax assets reported on the balance sheets as of december  and the valuation allowance is subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  operating profits  in the tax jurisdictions giving rise to the deferred tax assets  become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas no 
 accounting for income tax sfas 
the recoverability criteria in sfas requires our judgment of whether it is more likely than not  based on an evaluation of positive and negative evidence  that a valuation allowance is not needed 
if in the future  positive evidence of sufficient quality and quantity overcomes the negative evidence  we would reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowance resulting in a decrease to our income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and need for valuation allowances quarterly 
we do business in a number of different countries 
tax authorities may scrutinize the various tax structures employed by us in these countries 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves  including our valuation reserve for deferred tax assets  to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these countries 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense or reduction to our related valuation reserve would result 
in addition  any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit could affect the individual items that comprise our fully reserved deferred tax asset balance 
contingencies and litigation on an ongoing basis  management monitors the need to provide an estimated loss contingency arising from normal operations or litigation matters 
the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business 
at december  and  we have accrued for all probable and estimable contingencies 
we rely on our in house counsel and outside counsel to advise us about ongoing litigation matters 
although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate disposition of these matters and the proceedings disclosed above  we believe  based upon the information available at this time  that the expected outcome of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
overview of financial results the following overview will highlight certain key events and factors impacting our financial performance over the past three years year for  we recorded a net loss of million loss per share on revenues of million 
our revenue growth in was primarily due to bringing our new bit products to market  expanding our multi lane and quick service restaurant customer qsr base  and serving the growing european market led by tightening security standards 
the results include a second quarter charge of million to write off all costs previously deferred under our contract with the brazilian health ministry 
we continue to actively pursue the claim with the brazilian health ministry  although ultimate recovery cannot be assured 
the increase in revenues was tempered by a decline in gross profit as a percent of revenues resulting primarily from the aforementioned deferred contract charge in brazil 
to a lesser degree  the gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by pricing pressures in certain markets  a lower margin on a high volume contract with a domestic processor  sales to high volume multi lane and quick service restaurant customers  and incremental inventory reserves attributable to technology obsolescence induced by our new product offerings and altered market demand for dated products and components 
additionally  the gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by the reclassification of certain leases as operating leases rather than sales type leases 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses increased by million in  from million in to million in operating expenses represented of net revenues in versus in this increase was primarily due to costs for section of the sarbanes oxley act compliance and higher selling expenses principally related to accelerating expansion into certain markets in response to market opportunities and pre selling costs related to longer sales cycle multi lane contracts 
non operating expenses net interest expense  foreign currency losses and other income loss decreased by million in this decrease is primarily due to higher interest income as a result of our increased cash balance and rising interest rates and lower interest expense as a result of reduced debt fees and the cessation of amortization of debt issuance costs in we continued to build our cash reserves  increasing our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities from million at december  to million at december  during  our working capital increased by million 
in  we believe that technology requirements in the various marketplaces will continue to shift towards a bit architecture driven by market requirements for enhanced multi application and internet protocol ip enabling devices that significantly reduce transaction processing time 
we believe our revenue will exceed the amount as shipments of our bit technology terminals gain momentum led by our multi lane and unattended terminal product lines 
we anticipate that the average selling price of our products will decline in due to pricing pressures from our competitors and we intend to offset  at least partially  the reduction in selling price by reducing production costs of our terminals 
we intend to further reduce our product costs through design improvements and shifting certain high volume production to lower cost manufacturing regions  such as china 
we also intend to have a market centric approach to our research and product development activities such that we will not incur expenses that do not represent known revenue opportunities 
we do not anticipate any significant further fixed costs and therefore expect to leverage both our selling  general and administrative expenses on anticipated higher revenues 
we continue to evaluate our direct sales channel infrastructure and will pursue alternate channels  such as distributors  in regions where it makes economic sense to do so 
we also intend to continue to refine our global tax strategy and foreign exchange hedging program to lower expenses in these areas 
our projected revenue growth  engineered cost reductions and expense savings can not be ultimately assured 
year the year was highlighted by the completion of our profit improvement and restructuring plan initiated in september with a resulting improvement in operating income and net income  strengthening of our balance sheet  and the sale of golden eagle leasing 
completing our restructuring plan during allowed us to focus on our core terminal and network systems business  which resulted in improved gross margins while maintaining operating expenses at levels appropriate to support the core business activities 
gross margins improved principally from continuing improvements in cost reductions in our core set of product offerings through reductions in material costs as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies 
operating expenses were essentially unchanged from reflecting a leveling off of spending to match our business model as contemplated under our profit improvement and restructuring plan initiated in september in addition to improving our profits  we were able to strengthen our balance sheet as of december  compared to december  improvements in our balance sheet included an increase in cash and short term investment balances  elimination of current debt and increased working capital and stockholders equity 
we maintained a million revolving line of credit with no borrowings during these achievements were principally a result of our profit improvements  improvements in our accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turnover  and the sale of golden eagle leasing 
while we continued to experience improvements in the financial performance of golden eagle leasing  we decided a direct finance leasing operation was outside our core business and did not have a long term role in our strategic plan 
consequently  we sold golden eagle leasing in the fourth quarter of resulting in a gain of million  with gross proceeds received of million 
year the year was highlighted by the completion of a private placement of our common stock  significant charges related to the carrying value of goodwill and deferred tax assets  the implementation of a profit improvement plan and a significant improvement in income from continuing operations 
in the first quarter of  we completed the issuance and sale of common stock in a private equity offering 
net proceeds from the offering of million were used principally to pay off high cost debt 
as a result of the early extinguishment of debt  we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt relating to the write off of debt issuance costs in the amount of million in the first quarter of on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of sfas resulted in the complete write off of goodwill balances  existing at january   in the amount of million 
in accordance with sfas  this write off was reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the statement of operations 
during the third quarter of  we increased our valuation allowance on our then remaining deferred tax assets by million 
the increase in the valuation allowance increased our tax expense attributable to both continuing operations and discontinued operations by million 
there were no remaining balances of deferred tax assets reported on the balance sheet as of december  as discussed further in management s discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we undertook a profit improvement plan in  which resulted in restructuring certain operations and holding other operations for sale as discontinued operations 
the restructuring costs element of the plan were reported as expenses within income from continuing operations  while the losses from the discontinued operations were reported separately as part of our net loss 
the restructuring charges totaling million included write downs of assets  principally inventories and fixed assets  as well as accruals for severance and other operating expenses 
losses from discontinued operations totaling million included million in initial write downs of assets to fair value  as well as the operating results of the discontinued operations during the following should be read in light of the matters highlighted in the overview 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth the operating results expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of future results 
year ended december  net revenue costs of revenue write off of deferred contract costs gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges income loss from continuing operations interest and other income net of interest and other expense foreign currency loss loss on early extinguishment of debt income loss before taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes income loss before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss net revenue by geographic region is presented in the following table as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues by region united states europe latin america  including mexico asia pacific totals the results of continuing operations discussed herein exclude the operations of the operating units being reported as discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our revenues relate primarily to the sale and lease of point of sale and point of transaction terminals  peripheral devices  transaction networking devices  transaction management systems  application software and information delivery services collectively  product revenue 
additionally  we operate several service businesses that provide full on site support services such as installation  training  repair  help desk services and transaction transport collectively  service revenue 
no other type of revenue exceeded of our consolidated net revenues in  or comparison of years ended december  and years ended december  of of increase revenue revenue decrease dollars in thousands net revenue product and other services total net revenue costs of revenue product and other write off of deferred contract costs services total costs of revenue gross profit product and other services gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative income loss from continuing operations net revenue our year over year increase in net revenue is principally the result of product sales in our european and us markets 
the increase in european revenues arose as customers purchased new terminals to meet the security compliance standards set forth by europay  mastercard and visa emv 
emv governs the replacement of traditional magnetic strip cards with chip cards 
merchants must upgrade their terminals to meet the new emv standards or potentially bear the liability of fraudulent transactions which chip technology would have prevented 
we anticipate continued demand due to the emv initiative throughout revenue growth in the us related to product sales to multi lane and quick service restaurant customers which we had not historically served 
the introduction of new products including the l terminal and unattended units allowed us to expand in the marketplace which contributed significantly to our record fourth quarter sales 
we anticipate continual growth in this market in offsetting our revenue growth was the impact of an accounting correction made during the fourth quarter following our determination that certain leases originated by our uk subsidiary during the first three quarters of were incorrectly accounted for as sales type leases  rather than operating leases 
this accounting error  which relates to approximately  leases  resulted in a million reduction in net revenue for the first three quarters of see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
finally  net revenue in benefited by a million transaction in brazil involving the sale of fully depreciated terminals we had previously leased to a third party under an operating lease 
excluding the million in revenue in  net revenue increased million or from no similar transaction occurred during the increase in services revenues was primarily due to additional services provided by netset  our service business in brazil 
during  netset signed a service contract with one major new customer and increased service volumes to an existing customer 
additionally  service revenues increased in due to the start up of hbnet  our transaction transport business 
costs of revenue our costs of revenue include the costs of raw materials  manufacturing labor  overhead and subcontracted manufacturing costs  as well as loan loss provisions with respect to sales type leases 
cost of revenue  excluding the write off of deferred contract costs discussed below  as a percent of revenue increased to in compared to in the year over year increase in costs of revenue as a percent of revenues was principally attributable to incremental inventory reserves totaling million recorded during the incremental inventory reserves were attributable to technology obsolescence induced by our new product offerings and altered demand for dated products and components 
write off of deferred contract costs during the second quarter of  we recorded an million charge to cost of revenue to write off all costs previously deferred under our long term contract with the brazilian health ministry 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our decision was principally due to the lack of timely acknowledgement and acceptance of the pending claim  the expiration of the contract during april and the delay in the negotiation of the extension of the maintenance element of the contract 
we believe that the delay was due to an internal scandal within the brazilian health ministry  which in no way relates to hypercom or our pending claim  but nevertheless  cast doubt and concern over the ability to recover  timely  the amounts owed under the contract 
we are actively pursuing discussions with the brazilian health ministry regarding both the collection of the contract costs as well as renewal of the maintenance element of the contract 
however  there is no certainty as to how much will ultimately be collected or that the maintenance contract will ultimately be extended 
gross profit gross profit as a percent of revenue decreased to in from in the product and other gross profit percentage was in compared to in  while the services gross profit percentage was in and in the decline in the product and other gross profit percentage is principally attributable to the provision recorded to reserve all costs previously deferred under our contract with the brazilian health ministry 
excluding the contract provision  the product and other gross profit percentage was in the year over year decline in margin  exclusive of the brazilian health ministry charge in and the previously mentioned impact of the sale of the fully depreciated terminals in brazil in  is principally attributable to lower average selling price and gross profit on comparable products sold under the terms of a new domestic processor agreement and incremental inventory reserves recorded during the decrease in the services gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to fewer high margin special service projects  such as software uploads and pinpad upgrade programs  in than research and development research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
research and development expenses as a percent of revenue was in compared to in on a relative dollar basis  spending increased million compared to the increase in research and development spending is reflective of our efforts to accelerate the introduction of new products including our optimum product family and an internet protocol ip enabling device  in tact  that converts existing hypercom terminals into faster ip enabled card payment terminals 
selling general and administrative sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  and facilities operations make up the selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense was for compared to in on a relative dollar basis  spending increased million or 
the increase is principally attributable to variable costs attributed to our increase in revenues and additional professional fees incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  during we recorded a million charge to write off a marketing right that we determined had no future value 
interest income  interest expense  and foreign currency we recognized million in interest income during compared to only million in this increase is principally attributable to our high cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances maintained throughout resulting from the sale of golden eagle leasing in october and our positive cash flow from operations 
we incurred interest expense of million in compared to million in the decline in interest expense is primarily due to the continued decline in our long term debt  reduced fees under our senior secured credit facility  which was amended effective december   and the reduction in amortization of debt issuance costs  as the majority of costs were fully amortized as of july foreign currency loss for was million compared with million in the increase in foreign currency expense is principally attributable to the continued depreciation of the us dollar against our foreign currency exposures compared to income tax expense income tax expense before discontinued operations for federal  state and foreign taxes was million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
income tax expense is principally comprised of income taxes associated with our profitable foreign locations 
during  we continued to provide full valuation reserves against our deferred tax assets 
these reserves are subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas due to our net operating loss position and our provision for a full valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets  the consolidated effective tax rates for and are not meaningful 
we do business in a number of different countries 
tax authorities may scrutinize the various tax structures employed by us in these countries 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves  including our valuation allowance  to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these countries 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense or reduction of our valuation allowance would result 
in addition  any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit could affect the individual items that comprise our fully reserved deferred tax asset balance 
comparison of years ended december  and years ended december  of of increase revenue revenue decrease dollars in thousands net revenue product and other services total net revenue costs of revenue product and other services total costs of revenue gross profit product and other services total costs of revenue research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges income from continuing operations net revenue net revenue for decreased million or compared to net revenues for included the attainment of a performance milestone under our brazilian health ministry contract resulting in revenue of million during  versus million in revenue recognized under the same contract in performance milestones under this contract were substantially less than the milestones achieved in  as we had entered the maintenance phase of this contract 
in addition  as mentioned above  during we transacted the sale of terminals that we had previously leased to a third party to derive rental income under an operating lease 
the sale of these terminals was accounted for under a sales type lease arrangement and contributed million in revenues 
exclusive of the revenues for the brazilian health ministry contract in both years and the revenues under the sales type lease arrangement in  net revenues declined during the year ended december  by million compared to this decline is principally due to a decline in network systems revenues associated with one of its largest contracts 
revenues under this contract in were essentially limited to software maintenance  while included both hardware deliveries and software maintenance 
the decrease in product and other revenues was partially offset by an increase in services revenues  primarily due to the addition of a new service business in mexico that began operations during costs of revenue and gross profit our cost of revenue includes the cost of raw materials  manufacturing labor  overhead and subcontracted manufacturing costs  as well as loan loss provisions with respect to sales type leases 
cost of revenue as a percent of total net revenue was in compared with in gross profit as a percent of total net revenue for was compared to in both the change in cost of revenue and the gross profit were affected by various events in both and as discussed previously  included million in revenue from the brazilian health ministry contract versus million recognized in this contract carried a fully absorbed operating margin estimated at thus impacting the overall gross profit percentage as revenues were inconsistent between periods 
furthermore  our gross profit benefited from the sale of fully depreciated terminals we had previously leased to a third party  contributing million to our gross profit in additionally  cost of product and other revenues for includes the effects of restructuring charges in the amount of million relative to our restructuring activity discussed further below 
in connection with our restructuring  we transitioned our manufacturing operations in brazil to a contract manufacturer 
during this transition period certain sales in the brazilian market were supplied from our factory in china for which importation and taxes reduced our gross profit by approximately million in we also wrote down inventory and incurred other incremental charges relative to assessments of net realizable value amounting to million during the third quarter of exclusive of the brazilian health ministry revenues and related cost of revenues  the sale of fully depreciated terminals in and the restructuring and other charges incurred during  gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  and would be and  respectively 
the increase in is a result of our continued manufacturing and product cost reductions and improved pricing in certain service operations 
the services gross profit percentage was in compared to in the services gross profit includes a net gross loss of million associated with the start up of our service business in mexico 
research and development research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
research and development expenses for decreased million or 
the spending in research and development was flat year over year due to our continued focus on a cost efficient approach to research and development 
during development initiatives were primarily focused on reducing the component costs of existing product and developing select new products having a commercially feasible market demand 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  facilities operations and other corporate overhead 
these expenses increased million or to million for compared to million in the slight increase principally represents certain additions to our direct sales activities as we identify new markets and promote new product offerings 
restructuring charges in september  we committed to a plan to improve profits in our pos and network systems segment 
the plan entailed downsizing and outsourcing certain operations and streamlining product offerings  changing to a distributor sales model versus a direct sales model in certain international locations  prioritizing and rationalizing research and development expenditures and disposing of certain unprofitable operations 
the profit improvement plan encompassed both restructuring activities to be accounted and reported under sfas  as well as discontinued operations to be accounted and reported under sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the restructuring charges encompassed write downs of fixed assets and inventory  one time termination benefits and other miscellaneous accruals incurred in connection with our profit improvement plan 
the following table sets the amount incurred during the year ended december  in thousands incurred restructuring charges in cost of sales write down of inventories and related costs total restructuring charges in cost of sales restructuring charges write down of building to fair value write down of fixed assets to fair value write down of other assets to fair value one time termination benefits miscellaneous operating accruals total restructuring charges there were no restructuring charges incurred in interest expense and foreign currency we incurred million in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to million in interest expense for consisted principally of interest expense on long term borrowings and amortization of deferred financing charges 
interest expense for included essentially the same elements as plus additional interest incurred on two term loans with principal balances totaling million and a million note from a former director and former stockholder outstanding during the first quarter of the term loans and note were paid off in march with proceeds we received from a private placement of common stock 
foreign currency losses totaling million for the year ended december  were largely attributable to forward contract hedge premiums and local transaction losses in our swedish subsidiary 
foreign currency losses for the year ended december  of million related to the devaluation of the brazilian real and argentinean peso partially offset by gains in the british pound 
the reduced loss is a result of a hedging program we implemented during to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
loss on early extinguishment of debt during we repaid two term loans with principal balances of million and million  respectively  under our credit facility  million in outstanding loans from a director and principal stockholder and reduced the outstanding borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
in connection with the early retirement of the term loans  we recorded a loss on retirement of debt of million during the first quarter of principally resulting from the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a loan discount associated with our term loans 
income tax expense income tax expense before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for federal  state and foreign taxes was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the income tax provision for was comprised of income taxes associated with our profitable foreign locations 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our then remaining unreserved deferred tax asset balance of approximately million 
we further increased our valuation allowance in for net increases in deferred tax assets related to expense charges that were not deductible or recoverable 
the increase in the valuation allowance was based on the weight of all available evidence  principally influenced by the continued us derived losses in the third quarter of as well as cumulative us derived losses in recent years 
the us derived losses in the third quarter of and cumulatively over recent years together with an uncertain economic outlook for the us  were deemed to be significant negative evidence 
as a result  we determined we did not meet the more likely than not recoverability criteria in sfas  requiring positive evidence of sufficient quality and quantity to overcome the negative evidence in order to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed 
the valuation allowance is subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas there were no remaining unreserved balances of deferred tax assets reported on the balance sheet at december  in addition to deferred tax expenses  which principally relate to our valuation allowance increases  the income tax provision for the year ended december  was comprised of income tax expenses from foreign locations with taxable income and a current tax benefit for certain us losses in which we filed a claim for refund 
as a result of this combination of occurrences  the effective tax rate in was not meaningful 
there was no income tax expense recorded in discontinued operations during  as the income tax was offset by the reversal of valuation allowances previously placed against deferred tax assets allocated to discontinued operations during income tax expense recorded in discontinued operations for was million  and was principally attributable to the valuation allowance placed against golden eagle leasing s deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and occasionally from borrowings under a line of credit and or other debt facilities 
during our primary source of cash was cash generated by our operations as well as cash received from the issuance of employee stock options and warrants 
we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit during cash flows from continuing operations cash provided by operating activities is net income loss adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operating activities declined from million for to million for the decline is principally attributable to changes in our operating assets and liabilities partially offset by increased cash basis income 
cash basis income consists of net income loss adjusted for the add back of all non cash charges 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities consist of the following dollars in thousands 
year ended december  change accounts receivable net investment in sales type leases inventories income tax receivable accounts payable other changes in operating assets and liabilities most notably  cash flows from operations for the year ended december  was impacted by the receipt of a million income tax refund related to a us net operating loss carryback claim 
we received no similar cash refund during changes in accounts receivable  inventories  and accounts payable are directly related to our fourth quarter revenues in which we experienced a increase when compared to the same quarter a year ago 
the increase in inventories is principally due to the procurement of raw materials needed to manufacture our new bit products that we began shipping in the third and fourth quarters of the new products required components that had significant lead times and  given our high fourth quarter sales  required us to purchase quantities that would be sufficient to meet our forecasted demands 
the increase in accounts payable is directly related to outstanding balances owed to vendors from which we procured raw materials 
the increase in accounts receivable relates to shipments to customers in late november and december for which we had not received payment 
payment terms for most of our customers are generally between and days 
our net investment in sales type leases favorably impacted cash flows from operations during the decline in the portfolio is the result of an increase in resources resulting in improved collections during the year and a decline in the lease base attributable to leases maturing more rapidly than new leases were originated 
cash flows from investing activities investing cash flows consist principally of capital expenditures and the investment of excess cash generated by our operations and from the sale of our discontinued operations 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in the change is primarily related to our investment of excess cash and cash equivalents in marketable securities 
during  our net investment in marketable securities was million compared to million in additionally  we generated million of cash proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations in cash used to purchase other assets during relates to cash paid under a loyalty agreement for future business related to our uk leasing operation 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment increased million from million in to million in during and  capital expenditures were principally for upgrades to computer software and hardware and equipment purchases 
we intend to spend approximately million to million over the next twelve months for capital expenditures related to leasehold improvements and production equipment due to the expansion of our manufacturing facility in china  and for upgrades of computer software and hardware 
cash flows from financing activities financing cash flows consist principally of the issuance of common stock  repayment of long term debt  and cash received from notes receivable from two former stockholders 
during  cash provided by financing activities increased million principally due to proceeds from stock options and warrant exercises 
additionally  during march  we received million in cash from two former principal stockholders to repay notes that came due 
cash used to repay long term debt declined million from and is attributable to our overall lower debt balances 
projected liquidity and capital resources at december   working capital and cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively  compared to million and million at december   respectively 
current marketable securities increased million from million at december  to million at december  we believe that these cash reserves and marketable securities combined with our positive operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our projected liquidity and capital resource requirements through additionally  we are actively pursuing opportunities to monetize our existing lease portfolio which  if successful  would substantially increase our cash reserves 
should operating results prove unfavorable  we may need to use additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases covenant not to compete minimum purchase obligations other long term liabilities total minimum purchase obligations include all outstanding obligations to purchase goods or services at december  including agreements that are cancelable without penalty and agreements which are enforceable and legally binding 
we estimate that approximately or less of the outstanding purchase obligations at december  are non cancelable due to the customized nature of the order 
private placement of common stock on march   we completed the issuance and sale of  shares of our common stock  par value per share the shares  at a price of per share 
the shares were sold in a private offering transaction exempt from registration under section of the securities act of  as amended 
the shares were subsequently registered with the securities and exchange commission effective may  the net proceeds of the private offering amounted to million and were used to repay two term loans with principal balances of million and million  respectively  under our credit facility  million in outstanding loans from a director and principal stockholder and to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the early retirement of the term loans  we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million during the first quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
debt amendments effective december   we amended our senior secured credit facility with foothill bank foothill senior secured credit facility to a fully cash secured arrangement in an effort to reduce costs and to further match our current liquidity needs 
under the terms of the amended and restated agreement  we were required to maintain a million unrestricted cash balance and were limited on the amount of certain additional debt we could incur 
any borrowings under the revolving line of credit must be fully secured by an equal amount of cash 
all other financial covenants and most of the restrictions under the former agreement were removed 
the available credit on the revolving line of credit  which was previously reduced to million during march  was further reduced to million under the amended and restated foothill senior secured credit agreement 
the interest rate was reduced from the greater of or prime plus  to the greater of or prime plus 
we had no advances on the revolving line of credit during and no outstanding balance under the foothill senior secured credit facility at december  and on january   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na wells fargo the credit agreement  pursuant to which we will have access to a million line of credit 
the credit agreement replaces our million foothill senior secured facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement will be fully collateralized by short term securities held in our accounts with wells fargo and will bear interest at a rate set forth in each promissory note issued at the time of the advance 
the credit agreement contains customary default provisions and will expire in july at december   the company had a million letter of credit outstanding with wells fargo bank in support of a materials vendor 
stock repurchase in june  the board of directors authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to  shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million in common stock to maximize shareholder value 
during  we purchased  shares of our common stock for million 
the repurchased shares were recorded as treasury stock and resulted in a reduction in stockholder s equity 
the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend on market conditions and corporate considerations 
there were no repurchases during off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k and fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised 
backlog we include in backlog all revenue specified in signed contracts and purchase orders to the extent that we contemplate recognition of the related revenue within one year 
there can be no assurance that the contracts included in backlog will actually generate the specified revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated within the one year period 
as of december   our backlog was million  compared to million at december  the decrease in backlog is principally related to the fulfillment of orders for major customers within the united states that are subject to a customer approved delivery schedule 
in recent years  customers have shown a reluctance to enter into long term firm commitments that we would include in backlog 
our backlog is predominately related to contracts with north american customers who comprise and  of the total backlog at december  and  respectively 
we have seen a change in order patterns  such that most sales contracts are now signed and fulfilled within the same quarter 
accordingly  we do not believe that our current backlog is indicative of our near term sales 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment  which will be effective for public entities as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  sfas revised replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas revised requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized as compensation cost in the financial statements based on their fair values 
as such  reporting employee stock options under the intrinsic value based method prescribed by apb will no longer be allowed 
we have historically elected to use the intrinsic value method and have not recognized expense for employee stock options granted 
we plan to adopt sfas revised on july  on a prospective basis 
upon adoption  all future employee stock option grants plus the balance of the non vested grants awarded prior to july   will be expensed over the stock option vesting period based on the fair value at the grant date of the option 
although we are still evaluating certain requirements of sfas revised  we intend to continue using the black scholes option valuation model for previously granted options 
we estimate that the impact of adoption in will be an additional expense of approximately million after tax for employee stock options granted prior to december  we also have an employee stock purchase plan espp that provides a discount of from the market price and an option to purchase the shares each quarter at the lower of the stock price at the beginning of the quarter or the end of the quarter 
under the provisions of sfas revised  the discount and option provisions under the espp are considered compensatory 
we believe the incremental compensation cost required by sfas revised for the espp will not be material to our operating results 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb  chapter sfas no 
the standard requires that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred 
this standard also provides guidance for the allocation of fixed production overhead costs 
this standard is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt this standard in fiscal we have not yet determined the impact  if any  this statement will have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions 
sfas requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair value  rather than at carryover basis  unless neither the asset received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within reasonable limits or the transactions lack commercial substance 
sfas is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp no 
 provides guidance under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp no 
states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fas we do not plan to repatriate cash under the jobs act given our current net operating loss position 
accordingly  we do not believe that fsp no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf no 

eitf s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be impaired temporarily 
in september  the fasb issued fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective with this annual report for once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  we will evaluate the impact of the accounting provisions of eitf item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our cash equivalent investments are primarily in money market accounts and certificates of deposit and are reflected as cash equivalents because all maturities are within days from date of purchase 
our interest rate risk with respect to existing investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned which approximate current interest rates 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities  was million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels of december   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material given that our investments typically have interest rate reset features that regularly adjust to current market rates 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations and markets 
nevertheless  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a substantial portion of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do at times enter into these transactions in other currencies  such as the hong kong dollar  australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound and other asian and european currencies 
as a policy  we hedge the translation of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries in an attempt to neutralize the effect of translation gains or losses in the statement of operations 
financial hedging instruments are limited by our policy to foreign currency forward or option contracts and foreign currency debt 
we enter into forward or option contracts with our bank or other financial institutions to accomplish our hedging strategy 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the amount of million  denominated principally in the brazilian real and british pound 
gains and losses on these contracts principally consist of mark to market adjustments which are recorded in earnings as foreign currency gains or losses 
we do not purchase or hold any such derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation or arbitrage 
see risk factors international operations pose additional challenges and risks that if not managed could adversely affect our financial results elsewhere in this report 
at present  we have million in debt obligations and there are no borrowings under our line of credit facility at december  as such  our interest rate risk is limited with respect to existing debt 
during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discuss in this item a  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
