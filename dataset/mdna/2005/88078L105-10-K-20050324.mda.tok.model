overview we are focused on the development and commercialization of new therapeutics for the treatment of short stature and other related metabolic disorders 
our current product candidate is increlex  recombinant human insulin like growth factor  or rhigf we licensed the rights of genentech to develop  manufacture and commercialize rhigf products for a broad range of indications  including short stature  worldwide 
our initial focus is on developing increlex as a replacement therapy for primary igf deficiency  or primary igfd 
we define the indication primary igfd to mean a child who has a height standard deviation score  or height sds  and an igf standard deviation score  or igf sds  of less than minus two  and the indication severe primary igfd to mean a child who has a height sds and igf sds of minus three or less  in each case in the presence of normal or elevated levels of growth hormone 
we submitted an nda  seeking approval of long term rhigf replacement therapy for severe primary igfd to the fda  in february based on phase iii clinical trial data 
tercica  inc was formed in december as a delaware corporation 
in march  tercica  inc acquired an immaterial amount of assets  including intellectual property rights  from tercica limited  a new zealand company that had been formed in october tercica limited then made a liquidating distribution to its stockholders in march tercica limited and tercica  inc shared a common business strategy and overlapping stockholders 
as such  our financial statements include the activities of tercica limited  as the predecessor to tercica  inc  from october  
table of contents in april  we licensed from genentech intellectual property to develop and commercialize rhigf for a broad range of indications  including short stature and diabetes in the united states 
in december  we entered into a development and commercial supply contract for the manufacture of bulk rhigf drug substance with cambrex bio science baltimore  inc  or cambrex baltimore 
in july  we signed an international license and collaboration agreement with genentech obtaining its rights to develop and commercialize rhigf products outside of the united states for all indications other than diseases and conditions of the central nervous system 
in addition  we must enter into a written agreement with another company if we desire to commercialize increlex in diabetes outside of the united states 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we have funded our operations since inception through the private placement of equity securities and public offerings of common stock 
in  we raised million through the sale of shares of our series a preferred stock 
in  we raised million through the sale of shares of our series b preferred stock 
on march   we completed our initial public offering of common stock in which we raised net cash proceeds of approximately million and received an additional million of net cash proceeds on april  in connection with the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase additional shares 
on february   we completed our follow on public offering of common stock in which we raised net cash proceeds of approximately million 
on january   we entered into a loan agreement  or loan agreement  with venture leasing lending iv  inc  or vll  under which we have the option to draw down funds in the aggregate principal amount of up to  we paid a  fee as part of this loan agreement and issued vll  shares of our common stock  which are held in escrow  subject to certain conditions 
the  fee will be refunded to us if we borrow funds under this facility 
the option to draw funding under this loan agreement will continue to be available to us through june   subject to certain extensions and additional issuances of up to a maximum of  shares of our common stock 
any funding drawn down will have a three year term from the date of funding 
any borrowings are subject to cash payments of principal and interest at an interest rate of per annum  as well as a terminal interest payment at the end of the three year term equal to of the aggregate principal amount borrowed during the term of the loan 
under the terms of the loan agreement and an intellectual property security agreement  we would grant to vll a first priority security interest on certain assets  including limited intellectual property assets  in the event any borrowings occur 
we may terminate this facility at any time without penalty as long as no borrowings have been drawn down from the facility 
revenues we have not generated any operating revenues since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of our current product candidate  increlex  until at least late  if at all 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of contract manufacturing expenses  clinical activities  regulatory activities  payroll and related costs and non cash stock compensation 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on validating our manufacturing process at our contract manufacturer  using that process to make drug product suitable for clinical use and commercial sale and development activities related to severe primary igfd and primary igfd 
because we licensed non clinical  clinical and manufacturing data and know how related to rhigf from genentech in  we did not incur significant development expenses prior to however  we expect to fund our own development activities and will continue to incur significant costs in the future 
during  our research and development activities were primarily focused on two projects the transfer of our rhigf manufacturing process and the development project for primary igfd 
at the end of  we began to manage the development project for severe primary igfd as a separate project from the development project for primary igfd and completed the technology transfer of our manufacturing process to our contract manufacturer 
our primary focus in research and development in was associated with the establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process at our contract manufacturer and preparations for the anticipated nda filing in severe primary igfd 
with our nda submitted to the fda in february  we expect the remainder of to be focused on the preparation for pre approval inspections at our contract manufacturer  the completion of our development project for severe primary igfd and increased activities associated with our development project for primary igfd 
in  we expect that our project costs will be focused on fda inspection preparation activities at our contract manufacturers and costs related to clinical trials in primary igfd 
our projects or intended projects may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs  non cash stock compensation  facility costs  insurance  information technology  legal fees and accounting services 
other costs include sales and marketing activities such as pre launch planning and medical education activities 
during  we continued to expand our corporate staffing and infrastructure and initiated planning for sales and marketing activities 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in to increase due to associated costs with the annualized effect of personnel additions  personnel additions in  increased pre launch activities and the activities associated with the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 

table of contents the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows stock compensation we account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
 and related interpretations and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by apb no 
the information regarding net loss as required by sfas no 
has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement 
the resulting effect on net loss pursuant to sfas no 
is not likely to be representative of the effects on net loss pursuant to sfas no 
in future years  since future years are likely to include additional grants and the irregular impact of future years vesting 
stock compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  results from stock option grants at exercise prices below the reassessed fair value of the underlying common stock resulting in our recording stock compensation associated with these grants 
stock compensation expense is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying option  generally four years 
from inception through january   we recorded deferred stock compensation of million 
at december   we had a total of million of deferred stock compensation remaining to be amortized over the vesting period of the stock options of approximately three years 
in the year ended december   we reversed million of previously recognized stock compensation due to the forfeiture of unvested stock options from employee terminations 
we have not recorded any additional deferred stock compensation subsequent to january  the total unamortized deferred stock compensation recorded for all option grants through january   net of the amounts reversed associated with forfeited stock options will be amortized as follows million for the year ending december   million for the year ending december   and million for the year ending december  recent accounting development on december   the fasb issued an amendment to sfas no 
 share based payment  sfas no 
r  which is effective for public companies in periods beginning after june  we are required to implement the proposed standard no later than the quarter that begins july  sfas no 
r addresses the accounting 
table of contents for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
companies are required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and modified retrospective adoption options 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions and therefore have not fully assessed the impact of adopting sfas no 
r 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas current estimates of option values using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted by us 
we expect to continue to grant stock based compensation to employees  and the adoption of the new standard may have a material impact on our results of operations 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development relates to in licensed technology  intellectual property and know how 
the nature of the efforts for completion of research and development activities generally include completion of clinical trials  completion of manufacturing validation  interpretation of clinical and preclinical data and obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other foreign regulatory bodies  the cost  length and success of which are extremely difficult to determine 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist with timely completion of development projects  including clinical trial results  manufacturing process development results  and ongoing feedback from regulatory authorities  including obtaining marketing approval 
in addition  products under development may never be successfully commercialized due to the uncertainties associated with the pricing of new pharmaceuticals  the cost of sales to produce these products in a commercial setting  changes in the reimbursement environment  or the introduction of new competitive products 
as a result of the uncertainties noted above  we charge in licensed intellectual property and licenses for unapproved products to acquired in process research and development 

table of contents clinical trial expenses in the normal course of business  we contract with third party clinical research organizations to perform various clinical trial activities 
we recognize research and development expenses for these contracted activities based upon a variety of factors  including actual and estimated patient enrollment rates  clinical site initiation activities  labor hours and other activity based factors 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events as specified in each clinical study or trial contract 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the million in expenses were comprised of project costs associated with the establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process at cambrex baltimore totaling million  internal personnel and other costs totaling million  and our development projects for severe primary igfd and primary igfd totaling million 
in the year ended december   project costs for the establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process increased million from the same period in  and were driven primarily by production and validation activities at cambrex baltimore 
the costs associated with our development projects for severe primary igfd and primary igfd for the year ended december  increased by approximately million from the same period in the severe primary igfd and primary igfd project costs related primarily to conducting several small studies  the analyses of clinical trial data  nda filing preparations for severe primary igfd and start up costs related to the trials in primary igfd 
personnel costs for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in in  we expect that our project costs will be focused on inspection preparation activities at our contract manufacturers and costs related to clinical trials in primary igfd 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase of million was attributable to increased personnel costs of million  increased sales and marketing expenses of million and increased corporate administration expenses such as legal  insurance  information technology and other expenses of million

interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was due to interest on higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as a result of the cash proceeds received from the issuance of series b preferred stock in july and from our initial public offering in march preferred stock dividend 
in july  we sold  shares of series b preferred stock at per share  for total cash proceeds of approximately million

we have funded our operations and growth from inception with net cash proceeds of million in private equity financings and million from our initial public offering of common stock 
on february   we completed our follow on public offering of common stock in which we raised net cash proceeds of approximately million 

table of contents cash flow cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  the increase in was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the issuance our common stock in our initial public offering  partially offset by cash used in operating activities of million 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities for was due to increased personnel and infrastructure costs  the establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process at cambrex baltimore  and our development projects for severe primary igfd and primary igfd 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in was primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of series b preferred stock of million and proceeds from issuance of common stock associated with the early exercise of employee stock options of  partially offset by cash used to fund operations of million and purchases of property and equipment of million

senior credit facility on january   we entered into a loan agreement with vll under which we have the option to draw down funds in the aggregate principal amount of up to  we paid a  fee as part of this loan agreement and issued vll  shares of our common stock  which are held in escrow  subject to certain 
table of contents conditions 
the  fee will be refunded to us if we borrow funds under this facility 
the option to draw funding under this loan agreement will continue to be available to us through june   subject to certain extensions and additional issuances of up to a maximum of  shares of our common stock 
any funding drawn down will have a three year term from the date of funding 
any borrowings are subject to cash payments of principal and interest at an interest rate of per annum  as well as a terminal interest payment at the end of the three year term equal to of the aggregate principal amount borrowed during the term of the loan 
under the terms of the loan agreement and an intellectual property security agreement  we would grant to vll a first priority security interest on certain assets  including limited intellectual property assets  in the event any borrowings occur 
we may terminate this facility at any time without penalty as long as no borrowings have been drawn down from the facility 
litigation on december   we initiated patent infringement proceedings against avecia limited and insmed incorporated as co defendants in the high court of justice chancery division patents court in the united kingdom 
on december   we  with genentech  initiated patent infringement proceedings against insmed incorporated in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
we cannot predict the outcome of our litigation against avecia limited and insmed incorporated in the united kingdom or the outcome of our litigation against insmed in the united states 
moreover  we cannot predict the cost of such litigation  which may require a substantial diversion of our financial assets and other resources and consequently prevent us from allocating sufficient resources to the development of our rhigf programs  and which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  if the outcome of our litigation in the united kingdom is not favorable to us  we are likely to be found liable for the opposing parties costs incurred in connection with the litigation  and we could be found liable for an award of additional damages to the opposing parties if the court decides that our claims of patent infringement are without sufficient merit or not pursued in good faith 
if in our litigation in the united states  the court decides insmed prevails  and insmed establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the case is exceptional eg  our claims of patent infringement were not pursued in good faith  we could be liable for an award of the opposing party s costs and legal fees incurred in connection with the litigation and or an award of other damages 
any such award or awards to the opposing party or parties could substantially increase our costs and exacerbate the negative impact that an unfavorable outcome in the case s could have on our business 
further  it is not uncommon in cases of this kind for a defendant to assert counterclaims  which could significantly increase our costs  potential liability for damages  and other risks arising from these lawsuits  and a court could find us liable for any such damages caused by genentech as well 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations as of december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease commitments our commitments for operating leases include leases for real estate covering our present facility and office equipment 
in march  we entered into a new lease agreement for a facility in brisbane  california 
the term of the lease is months  and rent is abated for the first months 
under this lease agreement  the future minimum lease commitment for the years ending december     and are     and  respectively 
we also have contractual payment obligations  the timing of which is contingent on future events 
under our license agreements with genentech  aggregate payments of up to million would be due if milestones relating to the initial product approvals of rhigf for severe primary igfd in the united states and europe are achieved 
additional milestone payments would be due for subsequent indication approvals  including for approvals of products consisting of rhigf or igf binding protein  in the united states or europe 
under our agreement with cambrex baltimore  we are obligated to reimburse cambrex baltimore on a time and materials and per batch basis in connection with the establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process 
we estimate that our total purchase commitment to cambrex baltimore is approximately million through december  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  of million  together with the net proceeds of our follow on public offering completed in february and our senior credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least the end of we plan to make significant expenditures to operate our rhigf drug substance manufacturing process at cambrex baltimore in a manner consistent with current good manufacturing process cgmp  as well as to support our marketing  sales  regulatory and clinical trial activities 
as of december   the establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process and the development projects for severe primary igfd were substantially complete and we filed our nda for severe primary igfd in february in october  we initiated a phase iii clinical trial for primary igfd and expect to initiate additional clinical trials 
our projects may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
these projects may also yield varying results that could delay  limit or change the timing of a project s advancement through various stages of product development  
table of contents and significantly impact the costs to be incurred  and time involved  in bringing a project to completion 
as a result  the costs to complete such projects  as well as the timing of net cash outflows  are not reasonably estimable 
our future capital needs and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the costs  timing  scope of domestic and international regulatory approvals for rhigf  our ability to market and sell rhigf  the commercial readiness of our rhigf manufacturing operations at cambrex baltimore  including the success of our cgmp production activities  the success of drug product manufacturing and results of stability and product comparability studies performed at third party contractors  the rate of progress and cost of our future clinical trials and other research and development activities  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  and the status of competing products 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the manufacturing  clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the costs to complete our projects through product commercialization are not accurately predictable 
results from manufacturing operations and clinical trials may not be favorable 
further  data from clinical trials is subject to varying interpretation  and may be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals 
as such  our development projects are subject to risks  uncertainties and changes that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
as a result  our capital requirements may increase in future periods 
we expect that we will require and attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no commitments for any additional financings and additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or on acceptable terms 
additional funding may also result in dilution to our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our cash and cash equivalents through december  included liquid money market accounts 
our short term investments included readily marketable debt securities 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant negative impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december
