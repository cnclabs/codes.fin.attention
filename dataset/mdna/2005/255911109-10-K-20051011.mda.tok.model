many of the largest north american health care  utility companies and major international financial services institutions use our products and services 
we derive our revenues from asp hosting fees  professional services fees  software license fees and recurring maintenance fees related to our software products 
asp hosting revenue consists of transactional fees earned from customers who outsource the production of customer statements  insurance policies  utility statements and provider directories 
professional services revenue includes fees for implementation  integration  training and consulting services 
software license revenue is generally derived from the sale of perpetual licenses of software products 
maintenance revenue consists primarily of annual software maintenance and support agreements 
as set forth in the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  we are organized into two reportable segments software and asp 
the software segment consists of initial software license sales  professional services derived from implementation and integration of our software products and continued customer support and maintenance of the software products 
the asp segment provides processing  print  mail  archival and internet delivery of documents for customers who outsource these activities 
our operating results are strongly tied to software license revenue 
software license sales have a high margin and ultimately drive additional professional services and maintenance revenues 
a large portion of our software license revenue is generated from a small number of relatively large agreements executed in the latter half of a quarter 
the timing of such large agreements is often unpredictable and impacted by events beyond our control  therefore making it difficult to forecast software license revenue effectively 
due to the nature of our software license sales  revenues and profits may vary from quarter to quarter 
for the year ended july   total revenue increased to million  net income decreased  to million and earnings per diluted share decreased  to 
our revenue was favorably impacted by the newbridge acquisition and the addition of a large asp hosting contract in the fourth quarter 
the decrease in profitability is primarily due to lower margins in our asp business  increased software amortization and expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
additionally  stock based compensation expense increased approximately  including a charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter for the accelerated vesting of stock options 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of stock options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that would be recorded in future periods following our required adoption of sfas r 
revenue and operating results from our europe  middle east and africa emea operations significantly improved in fiscal for fiscal  revenue generated by emea increased approximately  representing record revenue 
operating results for the emea operations improved from an operating loss of approximately million for the year ended july  to essentially break even in the current year 
on september   we completed the acquisition of newbridge  a leading information services company for the health care market 
operating results of newbridge are primarily reflected in our asp hosting segment from the date of acquisition 
full integration of newbridge with our dallas asp center was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal our asp hosting revenue grew for the year ended july  due primarily to revenue generated by the acquisition of newbridge and revenue generated by a large outsourcing contract with capgemini energy which was signed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from existing asp customers 
the decline in revenue from existing customers is primarily due to the roll off of certain accounts over the last months  primarily as a result of a large customer being acquired by a company with significant print facilities of their own  and lower pricing on renewing accounts due to competitive pricing pressures 
the decrease in revenue from existing customers and lower utilization of equipment  facilities and personnel  have negatively impacted the gross margins achieved from our asp segment during the current year 
our financial position remains strong with million of cash on hand and available borrowings under our credit facility of million at july  critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies  which involve significant judgments and estimates  are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the sale of software licenses  annual software maintenance and support agreements  professional services and asp hosting services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue is recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses that are bundled with maintenance and support 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element s is deferred and the remaining value of the contract is recognized as revenue 
fair value of an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we do not generally sell software licenses without selling maintenance and support for the licensed software 
as a result  we have established vsoe only for the undelivered element s included in a multi element arrangement 
vsoe for maintenance and support is based upon prices customers pay to renew maintenance and support agreements 
after expiration of the initial maintenance term  maintenance and support agreements are renewable on an annual basis and include rights to upgrades  when and if available  telephone support  updates  enhancements and bug fixes 
revenue generated from maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term of the agreement 
we record deferred revenue for maintenance amounts invoiced prior to the performance of the related services 
our standard software license agreements do not provide for rights of software return and or conditions of acceptance 
however  in the rare case that acceptance criteria are provided  revenue is deferred and not recognized until all acceptance provisions are satisfied 
revenue from software licenses  which include a cancellation clause  is recognized upon expiration of the cancellation period 
license revenue related to products still in the testing phase is deferred until formal acceptance of the product by the customer 
professional services revenue includes implementation  integration  training and consulting services related to our software products 
the services offered are not essential to the functionality of the software sold 
professional services revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
professional services revenue derived from the installation and integration of software packages under a fixed price contract is recognized on a percentage of completion basis measured by the relationship of hours worked to total estimated contract hours 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends upon estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition and net income  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and net income 
when estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred on a contract upon completion  a provision for the expected loss is recorded in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
revenue from our asp hosting operations is recognized in accordance with sab  generally on a per transaction basis 
asp hosting agreements are generally one to five years in duration and provide for monthly billing based on transaction volume or contract minimums  if applicable 
revenue related to the customer s initial set up and implementation is deferred and subsequently recognized over the expected term of the asp hosting agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we take into consideration the current financial condition of our customers  the specific details of the customer accounts  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
sfas requires the capitalization of certain software development costs once technological feasibility is established 
the capitalized costs are then amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated product life  or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues  whichever provides the greater amortization 
management periodically assesses the realizability of software development costs when events and circumstances indicate a potential decline in value 
business combinations upon acquisition of a business  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities acquired and identifiable intangible assets 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from valuation specialists and the management from the acquired company 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  appraisals by valuation specialists  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
estimates used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we recognize an impairment charge associated with our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever we determine that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirement associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in future net cash flows or fair value could result in the inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby requiring an impairment charge to be recognized 
we perform an impairment analysis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  annually  during the third quarter  and whenever events and circumstances indicate that an impairment might be present 
our impairment analysis for our existing goodwill utilizes various assumptions and factors to estimate future cash flows to determine the fair value of the business 
no impairment was recognized during the fiscal year  however  if our estimates of cash flow or other factors adversely change  an impairment charge might be recorded in the future 
deferred taxes and valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that will more likely than not be realized  which will result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
translation of foreign currency we translate the financial statements of our european subsidiary into us dollars in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation 
assets and liabilities of our european subsidiary  whose functional currency is other than the us dollar  are translated at period end rates of exchange  and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and the translation of our intercompany loan to a consolidated foreign subsidiary are recognized in other income as incurred 
we account for unrealized gains or losses on our foreign currency translation adjustments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which requires adjustments to be accumulated in stockholders equity as part of other comprehensive income 
currently  we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities

asp hosting revenue grew  or million when compared to the prior year  primarily due to revenue related to the acquisition of newbridge and revenue generated by a large outsourcing contract with capgemini energy  which was signed during the fourth quarter 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in revenue from existing customers as certain accounts rolled off over the last months as a result of a significant customer being acquired by a company with print facilities of their own  and lower pricing on renewing accounts due to competitive pricing pressures 
professional services revenue increased  or approximately  due largely to an increase in revenue generated by our emea operations of approximately  and improved billing rates for our domestic professional services 
license revenue of million declined for the year ended july   as a result of fewer license sales in north america  partially offset by an increase in license sales in emea 
maintenance revenue decreased approximately  in fiscal due to certain legacy customers consolidating multiple existing licenses when upgrading to enterprise wide versions of our latest technology 
backlog for our products and services was million as of july   of which million is scheduled to be satisfied within one year 
backlog has increased when compared to million at july  backlog is primarily composed of recurring maintenance revenue for ongoing maintenance and support  software implementation and consulting services and asp hosting services 
maintenance agreements generally have an initial non cancelable term of up to five years and may generally be terminated after the initial term upon to days notice  however  we have not historically experienced material cancellations of such contracts 
software implementation and consulting services are principally performed under time and material agreements  of which some have cancellation provisions 
the estimated future revenues with respect to software implementation and consulting are based on management s estimate of revenues over the remaining life of the respective contract 
asp hosting agreements generally have one to five year terms and generally provide that fees are charged on a per transaction basis 
estimated future revenues of asp hosting services are based on contractual monthly minimums multiplied by the remaining term of the respective contract or management s estimate of revenues over the remaining life of the respective contract 
cost of revenues cost of asp hosting revenue 
cost of asp hosting revenue is composed primarily of salary and personnel related costs  facility and equipment costs and postage and supplies expense related to our asp hosting centers 
for the year ended july   cost of asp hosting revenue increased  or million  primarily due to the operating expenses associated with newbridge of million 
for fiscal and  cost of asp hosting revenue represented and of asp hosting revenue  respectively 
the increase in cost as a percentage of asp revenue is due to a decrease in revenue from existing customers due to the roll off of certain accounts over the last months primarily as a result of a significant customer being acquired by a company with print facilities of their own  lower pricing on renewing accounts and lower utilization of equipment  facilities and personnel

we expect the cost of professional services revenue to increase as professional services activities and revenue increase both domestically and internationally 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue includes amortization of capitalized software development costs and royalties paid to third parties 
for fiscal  cost of license revenue increased to million 
the increase is primarily due to additional amortization expense of approximately million related to new products introduced to the marketplace during fiscal we anticipate cost of license revenue to increase as amortization of capitalized development costs increases as new products become generally available

liquidity and capital resources at july   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and our revolving credit facility  which has available borrowings of million 
cash and cash equivalents for the year ended july   decreased million from million at july   primarily as a result of cash used to acquire newbridge and make payments on their outstanding past due liabilities and debt obligations 
during the year ended july   we generated million in cash flow from operations compared to million for the year ended july  the decrease of approximately million from the prior year was primarily a result of lower net income 
significant changes in assets and liabilities for the year ended july  that impacted cash flow from operations include an increase in cash due to the combined change in our income tax receivable and payable of approximately  and a decrease in cash due to the changes in accounts payable and deferred revenue of million

our board of directors believes the repurchase program is an appropriate means of increasing shareholder value  however  we have not made any purchases of stock since the safeguard transaction in june working capital was million at july   compared with million at july  the decrease in working capital of million is primarily due to cash expenditures of million to purchase newbridge and payments of approximately million on their outstanding and past due liabilities and debt obligations 
at july   we had a million revolving credit facility  which expires on august  the credit facility bears interest at the bank s prime rate less basis points or libor rate of interest plus basis points  and is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
under the credit facility and our bank note  we are required to maintain certain financial and non financial covenants 
as of july   there were no borrowings under this credit facility 
our liquidity needs are expected to arise primarily from the repayment of debt  obligations under capital leases  funding the continued development  enhancement and support of our software offerings and sales and marketing costs associated with expansion in new vertical and international markets 
a portion of our cash or borrowings under our revolving credit facility could be used to acquire complementary businesses or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products  which are subject to rapid technology changes  reduction in capital expenditures by our customers and intense competition  among other factors 
operating leases and purchase obligations related to services agreements are our only off balance sheet arrangements 
we currently anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash needs for the next twelve months 
the following is a schedule of our future contractual cash obligations as of july  in thousands less than after total year years years years operating leases      capital lease obligations    debt obligations    total contractual cash obligations      recently issued accounting guidance the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law on october  the act contains numerous amendments and additions to the us corporate income tax rules 
among other things  the act will provide a deduction with respect to income from certain us manufacturing activities and will provide a reduced tax upon certain repatriated foreign earnings 
although the provisions of the act did not impact the year ended july   the act may impact our future consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the financial impact of this act 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision to sfas sfas r requires employee stock based compensation awards to be accounted for under the fair value method and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb sfas r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is then recognized as compensation expense over the service periods 
sfas r is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  we will be required to adopt sfas r beginning august  for new awards of stock based compensation granted after that date 
at july   all outstanding options were fully vested  therefore management does not anticipate future compensation expense  related to existing options  to be significant under sfas r 
in march  the securities exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
sab provides the sec s view on the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations 
specifically  sab provides guidance on share based payment transactions with non employees  valuation methods  accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  capitalization of compensation costs related to share based payments arrangements  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements upon adoption of sfas r  the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of sfas r and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis subsequent to adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of sab will not have a material impact on our implementation of sfas r 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas which replaces accounting principals board opinions no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
was issued in may sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
specifically  this statement requires retrospective application of the direct effect for a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods financial statements  if it is practicable to do so 
sfas also strictly redefines the term restatement to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements 
sfas replaces apb no 
 which requires that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
unless adopted early  sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
