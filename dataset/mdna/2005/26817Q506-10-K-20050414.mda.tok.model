item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a financial services company  which invests in loans and securities principally consisting of  or secured by  single family mortgage loans  commercial mortgage loans  manufactured housing installment loans and delinquent property tax receivables 
the loans and securities in which the company invests have generally been pooled and pledged ie securitized as collateral for non recourse bonds non recourse securitization financing  which provides long term financing for such loans while limiting credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
the company earns the net interest spread between the interest income on the loans and securities in its investment portfolio and the interest and other expenses associated with the non recourse securitization financing 
the company also collects payments from property owners on its investment in delinquent property tax receivables 
the company manages the cash flow on these investments to maximize shareholders value 
in may  the company completed a recapitalization of its equity capital structure through the restructuring of its outstanding shares of series a  series b and series c preferred stock  resulting in the exchange of  shares of series d preferred stock and  shares of common stock for the shares of series a  series b and series c preferred stock 
the series d preferred stock has an issue price of per share  is convertible into one share of common stock and has the right to receive a quarterly dividend of per share 
during  the company completed a tender offer for its series a  series b and series c preferred stock resulting in a preferred stock benefit of million 
the company purchased and retired million shares of series a  series b and series c preferred stock in the resulting preferred stock benefit of million which was comprised of the elimination of million of dividends in arrears which was partially offset by a million premium to book value paid to obtain the preferred shares tendered and million of period accrual of dividends on the shares remaining after the completion of the tender offer 
the following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of the company 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
it should also be read in conjunction with the caution about forward looking statements section at the end of this discussion 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based in large part upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments or uncertainties  and which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  or the application of which may have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the following are the company s critical accounting policies 
consolidation of subsidiaries 
the consolidated financial statements represent the company s accounts after the elimination of inter company transactions 
the company consolidates entities in which it owns more than of the voting equity and control of the entity does not rest with others 
the company follows the equity method of accounting for investments with greater than and less than a interest in partnerships and corporate joint ventures or when it is able to influence the financial and operating policies of the investee but owns less than of the voting equity 
for all other investments  the cost method is applied 
impairments 
the company evaluates all securities in its investment portfolio for other than temporary impairments 
a security is generally defined to be other than temporarily impaired if  for a maximum period of three consecutive quarters  the carrying value of such security exceeds its estimated fair value and the company estimates  based on projected future cash flows or other fair value determinants  that the fair value will remain below the carrying value for the foreseeable future 
if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to exist  the company records an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the security down to its estimated fair value 
in certain instances  as a result of the other than temporary impairment analysis  the recognition or accrual of interest will be discontinued and the security will be placed on non accrual status 
the company considers an investment to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its recorded cost basis 
impairments of other investments are generally considered to be other than temporary when the fair value remains below the carrying value for three consecutive quarters 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded in order to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated value 
allowance for loan losses 
the company has credit risk on loans pledged in securitization financing transactions and classified as securitized finance receivables in its investment portfolio 
an allowance for loan losses has been estimated and established for currently existing probable losses 
factors considered in establishing an allowance include current loan delinquencies  historical cure rates of delinquent loans  and historical and anticipated loss severity of the loans as they are liquidated 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated and adjusted periodically by management based on the actual and estimated timing and amount of probable credit losses  using the above factors  as well as industry loss experience 
where loans are considered homogeneous  the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a pool basis 
otherwise  the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a loan specific basis 
provisions made to increase the allowance are a current period expense to operations 
generally  the company considers manufactured housing loans to be impaired when they are days past due 
the company also provides an allowance for currently existing credit losses within outstanding manufactured housing loans that are current as to payment but which the company has determined to be impaired based on default trends  current market conditions and empirical observable performance data on the loans 
single family loans are considered impaired when they are days past due 
commercial mortgage loans are evaluated on an individual basis for impairment 
generally  a commercial loan with a debt service coverage ratio of less than one is considered impaired 
however  based on a commercial loan s details  commercial loans with a debt service ratio less than one may not be considered impaired  conversely  commercial loans with a debt service coverage ratio greater than one may be considered impaired 
certain of the commercial mortgage loans are covered by loan guarantees that limit the company s exposure on these loans 
the level of allowance for loan losses required for these loans is reduced by the amount of applicable loan guarantees 
the company s actual credit losses may differ from the estimates used to establish the allowance 
financial condition below is a discussion of the company s financial condition 
december  amounts in thousands except per share data investments securitized finance receivables loans  net   debt securities   securities   other investments   other loans   non recourse securitization financing   repurchase agreements   senior notes  shareholders equity   book value per common share inclusive of preferred stock liquidation preference securitized finance receivables securitized finance receivables include loans and securities consisting of or secured by adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage loans secured by first liens on single family properties  fixed rate loans secured by first liens on multifamily and commercial properties  and manufactured housing installment loans secured by either a ucc filing or a motor vehicle title 
the securitized finance receivables decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  this decrease of million is primarily the result of million in principal pay downs  the derecognition of million of manufactured housing loans associated with the sale of the call rights on the related securitization trust  million of decreased allowance for loan losses  net  million of impairment charges recorded on debt securities and decreases in accrued interest payable of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the unrealized gains and premiums of million and million of amortization of loan discounts 
principal pay downs resulted from normal principal amortization of the underlying loan or security  and higher than anticipated prepayments on these assets due to the low interest rate environment 
the allowance for loan losses decreased primarily as a result of the sale of the manufactured housing loans and charge offs during the year on the manufactured housing and commercial loans exceeding the provisions on such loans 
impairment charges resulted from other than temporary decreases in market value on debt securities backed by manufactured housing loan collateral 
securities securities increased to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily as a result of the purchases of a million debt security and a million equity security and a million net increase in market value of available for sale securities 
these increases were partially offset by principal payments of million during the year and the sale of equity securities with a balance of million 
other investments other investments at december  and consist primarily of delinquent property tax receivables  a security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables  and the associated real estate owned 
other investments decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease of million resulted from the sale of a portfolio of tax lien receivables located in ohio portfolio with a basis of million  payments of million collected in and applied against the carrying value of the investment  million in sales of related real estate owned  and a million other than temporary impairment charge 
these decreases were partially offset by increases related to foreclosure advances made of million and the purchase of new receivables of approximately million  which were substantially sold in the ohio tax lien portfolio sale described above 
other loans other loans decreased to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to payments received on the loans of million 
non recourse securitization financing non recourse securitization financing decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  this decrease was primarily a result of principal payments received of million on the associated collateral pledged which were used to pay down the securitization financing in accordance with the respective indentures  the derecognition of million of non recourse securitization financing as a result of the sale of the call rights on the related securitization trust as described above  and a million decrease of accrued interest payable 
offsetting these decreases was the receipt of million from the redemption and reissuance of approximately million in bonds outstanding  and net amortization of approximately million of bond discounts and issuance and hedging costs 
repurchase agreements in december  the company entered into a million repurchase agreement to finance the purchase of approximately million of fixed rate securities 
this increase was partially offset by net repayments of million on repurchase agreement borrowings during senior notes the million of february senior notes outstanding as of december  were paid in march shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease of million resulted from a net loss of million  a net decrease of million resulting from the shares tendered for senior notes in connection with the recapitalization transaction completed in may and dividends declared on shares of series d preferred stock of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of million which resulted principally from the increase in fair value of debt and equity securities of million  and an increase of million on interest rate swap and synthetic interest rate swap contracts from the realization of losses on settled contracts and deferred gains on the remaining hedge contracts 
results of operations for the year ended december  amounts in thousands except per share information net interest income    provision for loan losses    net interest income after provision for loan losses    impairment charges    gain loss on sales of investments   general and administrative expenses    net loss    preferred stock charge benefit    net loss to common shareholders    basic diluted net loss per common share dividends declared per share common series a and b preferred series c preferred series d preferred compared to net loss decreased in by million  to million in from a loss of million in  as a result of an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of million and an increase in gain on sales of investments of million 
net loss to common shareholders decreased by million in  from million in to million in the improvement in net loss to common shareholders was due to reduced net loss of million  offset by the reduction in preferred stock benefit of million 
the preferred stock benefit in resulted from the effects of a tender offer on the outstanding preferred stock completed in as compared to the net effect of the recapitalization of the preferred stock in and preferred stock dividends 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million  from million for the same period in net interest income decreased million  or  as a result of a decline in average interest earning assets and a decrease in the net interest spread on interest earning assets 
net interest spread decreased in as a result of prepayments of higher coupon assets  the proceeds of which have been reinvested in lower yielding cash equivalents  and also decreased due in part to increasing borrowing costs from both increasing libor rates and repayment of lower cost securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms of the securitization trust 
see further discussion below as to changes in the net interest spread on the company s investment portfolio during net interest income after provision for loan losses increased as a result of the decline of the provision for loan losses in compared to of million 
provision for loan losses decreased to million in  from million in the decrease of million from was primarily due to million of provision for loan losses recorded during the second quarter of specifically for currently existing credit losses within outstanding manufactured housing loans that were current as to payment but which the company had determined to be impaired 
the remaining million of the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the estimated losses on commercial and manufactured housing loans 
impairment charges decreased from million in to million in impairment charges in included million on a debt security collateralized by manufactured housing loans and million on a debt security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables 
other than temporary impairment charges were recorded as a result of the carrying value of the debt securities referenced above exceeded their estimated fair value and the company determined that the carrying value would likely exceed the fair value for the foreseeable future 
impairment charges for included million on manufactured housing loan securities and million on delinquent property tax receivable securities 
gain on sale of investments for included a million gain from the sale of securitized finance receivables with a carrying value of million  net of allowance for loan losses of million  and the de recognition of the associated securitization financing bonds with a carrying amount of million 
the company received a net million in proceeds from the sale of these receivables 
this gain was partially offset by a million loss on the sale of the company s ohio delinquent property tax receivable investment 
the company reported a preferred stock charge of million for the year ended december   which represents a decline of million from the preferred stock benefit of million reported for the year ended december  this decrease in the preferred stock charge benefit was due to the recapitalization completed in and the tender offer completed in described in more detail above 
compared to net loss increased to million in from million in as a result of the decline in net interest margin  offset by a decline in impairment charges  an increase in gain on sale of investments  a decrease in other expense income relating to decreased trading losses  and a decrease in general and administrative expenses 
net loss per common share decreased during as compared to as a result of the preferred stock benefit for from the tender offer on the preferred stock completed in february net interest income before provision for loan losses for the year ended december  decreased to million  from million for the same period in the decrease in net interest income before provision for loan losses of million  or  was the result of a decline in average interest earning assets  a decrease in the net interest spread on interest earning assets  and a reduction in interest income in compared to for a security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables which  due to further impairment of the asset  was placed on non accrual status in provision for loan losses increased to million in  from million in provision for losses increased by million from as a result of additions to allowance for loan losses on commercial mortgage loans of million and reserves on losses on current manufactured housing loans in the company s investment portfolio of million for compared to million for for commercial mortgage loans  underlying commercial properties concentrated in the health care and hospitality industries generally under performed relative to expectations and suffered from high vacancy rates and lower fees and rents 
included in is million in provision for loan losses recorded specifically for currently existing credit losses within outstanding manufactured housing loans that were current as to payment but which the company has determined to be impaired 
previously  the company had not considered current loans to be impaired under generally accepted accounting principles and therefore had not previously provided an allowance for losses for these loans 
continued worsening trends in both the industry as a whole and the company s pools of manufactured housing loans prompted the company to prepare an extensive analysis on these pools of loans 
loss severity on the manufactured housing loans continued to remain high during as a result of the saturation in the market place with both new and used repossessed manufactured housing units 
defaults in on manufactured housing loans averaged on an annualized basis  compared to in  and loss severity on such loans approximated during the year 
while defaults on manufactured housing loans declined relative to  defaults are expected to remain at levels 
defaults are influenced by general economic conditions in the various local markets 
impairment charges decreased from million in to an aggregate million in such impairment charges included other than temporary impairment of debt securities pledged as securitized finance receivables of million for in addition  the company incurred impairment charges in of million related to a security where the underlying property tax receivable collateral has been foreclosed and represents real estate owned  and million of losses on investments in a limited liability partnership 
the impairment charges on the debt securities result from revised expectations on related collateral 
all cash received was applied to reduce the carrying value of the security 
gain on sale of investments for included the gain from the sale of loans acquired through the redemption of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage pass through securities previously issued and sold by the company 
upon redemption  the company collapsed the security structure and sold the underlying loans 
in  the company entered into a million notional short position on year treasury notes futures to  in effect  mitigate its exposure to rising interest rates on a like amount of floating rate liabilities 
these instruments failed to meet the hedge criteria of sfasards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and were accounted for on a trading basis 
the company terminated these contracts at a loss of million in no such trading activity was engaged in by the company in the company purchased and retired million of its series a  series b and series c preferred shares in resulting in a preferred stock benefit of million which was comprised of the elimination of million of dividends in arrears which was partially offset by a million premium to book value paid to obtain the preferred shares tendered and million of period accrual of dividends on the shares remaining after the completion of the tender offer

effective rates are calculated excluding non interest related non recourse securitization financing expenses and provision for credit losses 
compared to the net interest spread for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  this decrease can be generally attributed to the prepayment of higher coupon investments  principally securitized finance receivables  and the resulting reinvestment of net proceeds available as a result of these prepayments into lower yielding cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  net interest spread declined approximately from the non accrual status of a delinquent property tax receivable in compared to  and declined approximately as a result of net asset premium and bond discount amortization expense from the unexpected prepayment of approximately million in commercial mortgage loans during the overall yield on interest earnings assets  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the overall yield declined by as a result of the non accrual status in of a delinquent property tax receivable security  with the balance of the decline due to the prepayment of higher coupon investments 
in addition to declining asset yields  interest bearing liability costs increased from to as a result of the overall increase in market interest rates  including libor rates  and the repayment of lower cost securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms of the securitization trust 
approximately of the company s interest bearing liabilities re price monthly and are indexed to one month libor  which averaged for  compared to for in addition  interest bearing liability costs increased by approximately a net for bond discount amortization resulting from the prepayment of approximately million of securitization financing related to commercial loans which prepaid during the year 
compared to the net interest spread for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  while overall asset yields decreased  principally as a result of the prepayment of higher coupon investments  the resetting of interest rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans in the company s investment portfolio and the prepayment of higher rate loans in that portfolio  the overall weighted average liability costs decreased as well as a result of the overall decline in short term market interest rates 
the change in one month libor is a proxy for the change in the company s yield on the adjustable rate investments in its portfolio which have reset periods ranging from six months to one year and a proxy for change in the cost of borrowing for the company s floating rate liabilities which reset  on average  every month 
during  the one month libor averaged for  compared to for the overall yield on interest earnings assets  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in  following the falling rate environment and reflecting payments on higher coupon investments in the portfolio

interest income and interest earning assets approximately billion of the investment portfolio as of december   or  was comprised of loans or securities that pay a fixed rate of interest 
also at december   approximately million  or  was comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
the following table presents a breakdown  by principal balance  of the company s securitized finance receivables and securities  by type of underlying loan as of december   and libor based arm loans are adjustable rate mortgage loans  which carry a rate of interest based on a spread to six month libor 
cmt based arm loans are adjustable rate mortgage loans  which carry a rate of interest based on a spread to the one year constant maturity treasury index 
other indices based arm loans carry a rate of interest based on a spread to an index other than six month libor  such as the prime rate 
the percentage of fixed rate loans to all loans increased from at december   to at december  fixed rate loans at december  consisted principally of manufactured housing loans which have historically had low rates of prepayment  and commercial mortgage loans which are prohibited from prepayment for a period of up to ten years from their date of funding 
a substantial portion of the prepayments in the company s investment portfolio have occurred in the single family arm loans which carry no prepayment penalties 
given the low absolute interest rate environment  single family arm loans and fixed rate loans have experienced higher than historical average prepayment experience over the years presented

credit exposures as discussed in investment portfolio financing for our investment portfolio securitization trusts in item above  the company s predominate securitization structure is non recourse securitization financing  whereby loans and securities are pledged to a trust  and the trust issues bonds pursuant to an indenture 
generally these securitization structures use over collateralization  subordination  third party guarantees  reserve funds  bond insurance  mortgage pool insurance or any combination of the foregoing as a form of credit enhancement 
from an economic point of view  the company generally has retained a limited portion of the direct credit risk in these structures 
in many instances  the company retained the first loss credit risk on pools of loans and securities that it has securitized 
the following table summarizes the aggregate principal amount of certain investments of the company  the direct credit exposure retained by the company represented by the amount of over collateralization pledged and subordinated securities owned by the company  net of the credit reserves and discounts maintained by the company for such exposure  and the actual credit losses incurred for each year 
credit exposure  net of credit reserves is based on the credit risk retained by the company for the loans and securities pledged to the securitization trust  from an economic point of view 
for and  the table includes any subordinated security retained by the company 
the company s credit exposure  net of credit reserves  has decreased from by million due to the sale of million of securitized finance receivables  resulting in a net decrease of million  reduction of principal on loans of million  and an increase in reserves  net of losses of million 
the table excludes other forms of credit enhancement from which the company benefits  and based upon the performance of the underlying loans  may provide additional protection against losses as discussed in investment portfolio investment portfolio risks in item above 
this table also excludes any risks related to representations and warranties made on single family loans funded by the company and securitized in mortgage pass through securities generally funded prior to this table also excludes any credit exposure on loans and other investments

the previously reported information for and has been adjusted to be consistent with the presentation the following table summarizes single family mortgage loan  manufactured housing loan and commercial mortgage loan delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding collateral balance for those structures in which the company has retained a portion of the direct credit risk included in the table above 
the delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding collateral was at december   an increase from and at december  and  respectively  primarily from increasing delinquencies in the company s commercial mortgage loan and manufactured housing loan portfolios and a declining overall outstanding collateral balance as a result of prepayments 
the trend of delinquencies in the manufactured housing portfolio arises from general economic conditions  the maturity of the portfolio and depressed values of manufactured housing properties 
the increase in delinquencies in the commercial mortgage loan portfolio was largely due to one loan with a balance of approximately million in the accompanying financial statements 
a forbearance agreement with the borrower has been reached in principal on this loan  but it is subject to receipt of payment for certain costs associated with the loan before the agreement takes effect 
overall  less than day delinquencies on loans have improved as a result of improving performance in the single family and commercial mortgage loan portfolios 
the company monitors and evaluates its exposure to credit losses and has established reserves based upon anticipated losses  general economic conditions and trends in the investment portfolio 
management believes the level of credit reserves was proper for the inherent probable losses in the portfolio as of december  the trend of delinquencies within the portfolio is presented in the table below 
delinquency statistics to days to days days and over december  delinquent delinquent delinquent total includes foreclosures  repossessions and real estate owned 
in  the company began including certain subordinated securities in the calculations used to produce the information in the table above 
the previously reported information for and has been adjusted to be consistent with the presentation 
general and administrative expense the following table presents a breakdown of general and administrative expense by business unit 
corporate investment amounts in thousands servicing portfolio management total general and administrative expense decreased million from million in to million in general and administrative expenses for servicing decreased during with the sale in october of the ohio delinquent property tax receivable servicing operation 
corporate investment portfolio management expenses have increased primarily as a result of litigation and legal expenses 
the company s legal and litigation expenses incurred in were million compared to million in the company anticipates reductions in general and administrative expenses due to reduced litigation costs and reductions in its delinquent property tax lien servicing operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations from a variety of sources 
the company s primary source of funding its operations today is principally the cash flow generated from the investment portfolio  which includes net interest income and principal payments and prepayments on these investments 
the company also sold investments and other of its interests during the year generating approximately million in net cash flow  which included the proceeds from the sale of its rights to redeem and subsequently resell securitization financing bonds for a net million 
the company s investment portfolio continues to provide positive cash flow  which can be utilized by the company for reinvestment or other purposes 
the company has utilized its cash flow to repay recourse debt outstanding and to purchase loans and securities for its investment portfolio 
in  the company completed a recapitalization of its capital structure resulting in the issuance of a new series d preferred stock and common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of series a  b and c preferred stock 
the company s cash flow from its investment portfolio for the year and quarter ended december  was approximately million and million  respectively  excluding proceeds from the sales of investments 
such cash flow is after payment of principal and interest on the associated non recourse securitization financing ie  non recourse debt outstanding 
from the cash flow on its investment portfolio  the company funds its operating overhead costs  including the servicing of its delinquent property tax receivables  and repays any remaining recourse debt 
excluding any cash flow derived from the sale or re securitization of assets  and assuming that short term interest rates remain stable  the company anticipates that the cash flow from its investment portfolio will decline in compared to as the investment portfolio continues to pay down 
the company anticipates  however  that it will have sufficient cash flow from its investment portfolio to meet all of its obligations on both a short term and long term basis 
in the second quarter of  the company completed a recapitalization plan whereby the company converted its series a  series b  and series c preferred stock into a new series d preferred stock and common stock 
the aggregate required quarterly dividend on the shares of series d preferred stock outstanding as of december  was approximately million 
the series d preferred stock automatically converts to subordinate notes if the company fails to pay two consecutive quarterly dividends or if the company fails to maintain consolidated stockholders equity of at least of the aggregate issue price of the series d preferred stock 
in september  the company sold its delinquent property tax receivable portfolio located in cuyahoga county  ohio and its associated servicing operation  for million 
in addition  the company may receive contingent consideration of up to approximately million that also would be held in escrow for customary representations and warranties until the first anniversary of the sale 
we will continue to look to sell non core assets including our remaining investments in manufactured housing loans and delinquent property tax receivables 
at the same time  we are reducing our overhead and rationalizing our infrastructure costs 
as discussed in general business focus and strategy in item above  our goal is to be invested in short duration assets and cash while we evaluate opportunities that provide acceptable risk adjusted rates of return 
securitization financing we have historically used securitization financing to fund our investment portfolio 
the obligations under the securitization trust structure are payable solely from the securitized finance receivables pledged and are otherwise non recourse to us 
securitized trust structures are not subject to margin calls 
the maturity of each class of non recourse securitization financing is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral 
each series is also subject to redemption in whole or in part at our option according to specific terms of the respective indentures 
at december   we had billion of securitization financings outstanding 
one securitization trust is redeemable at our option beginning in april the respective indenture for the trust provides for increases in interest rates ranging from on the underlying non recourse securitization financing classes if such classes are not called by the issuer 
we anticipate redeeming these bonds and initially financing the redemption using repurchase agreement financing 
after the redemption  we will evaluate our alternatives with respect to this trust and may reissue the bonds 
for purposes of the contractual obligations table below  these obligations are not redeemed 
repurchase agreements we have repurchase agreement relationships with a counterparty for temporary financing of eligible investments 
we may continue to utilize repurchase agreement financing in the future  but we will manage the amount of this type of financing that we use as it is largely collateral dependent and puts our capital at risk if the collateral securing the repurchase agreement financing declines in value 
if we redeem the securitization financing trust redeemable in april  we anticipate financing the redemption of the outstanding bonds using repurchase agreement financing on a temporary basis  as discussed above 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table shows expected cash payments on contractual obligations of the company as of december  for the following time periods payments due by period contractual obligations total years long term debt obligations non recourse securitization financing      repurchase agreements   operating lease obligations total      as the master servicer for certain of the series of non recourse securitization financing securities which it has issued  and certain loans which have been securitized but which the company is not the master servicer of the security  the company has an obligation to advance scheduled principal and interest on delinquent loans in accordance with the underlying servicing agreements should the primary servicer fail to make such advance 
such advance amounts are generally repaid in the same month as they are made  or shortly thereafter  and the contractual obligation with respect to these advances is excluded from the above table 
amounts presented for long term debt obligations include estimated principal and interest on the related obligations 
securitization financing is non recourse to the company as the bonds are payable solely from loans and securities pledged as securitized finance receivables 
payments due by period were estimated based on the principal repayments forecast for the underlying loans and securities  substantially all of which is used to repay the associated securitization financing outstanding

all statements contained in this item as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report addressing the results of operations  our operating performance  events  or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to investment strategies  net interest income growth  earnings or earnings per share growth  and market share  as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results  are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are based upon management s views and assumptions as of the date of this report  regarding future events and operating performance and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following economic conditions 
the company is affected by general economic conditions 
an increase in the risk of defaults and credit risk resulting from an economic slowdown or recession could result in a decrease in the value of the company s investments and the over collateralization associated with its securitization transactions 
as a result of the company being heavily invested in short term high quality investments  a worsening economy could also benefit the company by creating opportunities for the company to invest in assets that become distressed as a result of the worsening conditions 
these changes could have an effect on the company s financial performance and the performance on the company s securitized loan pools 
investment portfolio cash flow 
cash flows from the investment portfolio fund the company s operations and repayments of outstanding debt  and are subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates  repayment rates and default rates and related losses 
cash flows from the investment portfolio are likely to sequentially decline until the company meaningfully begins to reinvest its capital 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to find suitable investment alternatives for its capital  nor can there be assurances that the company will meet its reinvestment and return hurdles 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans securitized by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from estimates made by the company or exceed reserves for losses recorded in the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual default rates or loss severity may differ from the company s estimate as a result of economic conditions 
actual defaults on adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
in addition  commercial mortgage loans are generally large dollar balance loans  and a significant loan default may have an adverse impact on the company s financial results 
interest rate fluctuations 
the company s income and cash flow depends on its ability to earn greater interest on its investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by the company generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
a majority of the company s investments  including loans and securities currently pledged as securitized finance receivables and securities  are fixed rate 
the company currently finances these fixed rate assets through non recourse securitization financing and repurchase agreements  approximately million of which is variable rate and resets monthly 
financing fixed rate assets with variable rate bonds exposes the company to reductions in income and cash flow in a period of rising interest rates 
through the use of interest rate swaps and synthetic swaps  the company has reduced this exposure by approximately million as of december  in addition  a portion of the investments held by the company are adjustable rate securitized finance receivables 
these investments are financed through non recourse long term securitization financing  which reset monthly 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have interest rates which reset on a delayed basis and have periodic interest rate caps  the related borrowing has no delayed resets or such interest rate caps 
third party servicers 
third party servicers service the majority of the company s investment portfolio 
to the extent that these servicers are financially impaired  the performance of the company s investment portfolio may deteriorate  and defaults and credit losses may be greater than estimated 
in addition  third party servicers are generally obligated to advance scheduled principal and interest on a loan if such loan is securitized  and to the extent the third party servicer fails to make this advance  the company may be required to make the advance 
the actual credit losses experienced by the company are in large part influenced by the quality of servicing by these third party servicers 
prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans securitized by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
the company s exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yielding investments 
competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market in which we compete with a number of institutions with greater financial resources 
in purchasing portfolio investments and in issuing securities  we compete with other mortgage reits  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  commercial banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  federal agencies and other entities  many of which have greater financial resources and a lower cost of capital than we do 
increased competition in the market and our competitors greater financial resources have adversely affected the company  and may continue to do so 
competition may also continue to keep pressure on spreads resulting in the company being unable to reinvest its capital at a satisfactory risk adjusted basis 
regulatory changes 
the company s businesses as of and for the year ended december  were not subject to any material federal or state regulation or licensing requirements 
however  changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect the company and the performance of the company s securitized loan pools or its ability to collect on its delinquent property tax receivables 
the company is a reit and is required to meet certain tests in order to maintain its reit status as described in the earlier discussion of federal income tax considerations 
if the company should fail to maintain its reit status  it would not be able to hold certain investments and would be subject to income taxes section of the sarbanes oxley act of based on the company s expected market capitalization at june   the company anticipates that it will be required to be compliant with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of by december  failure to be compliant may result in doubt in the capital markets about the quality and adequacy of the company s internal disclosure controls 
this could result in the company having difficulty in or being unable to raise additional capital in these markets in order to finance its operations and future investments 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the accounting standards executive committee acsec of the american institute of certified professional accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop no 
 accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop no 
is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption encouraged 
a certain transition provision applies for certain aspects of loans currently within the scope of practice bulletin  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans 
sop no 
addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
it includes loans acquired in business combinations and applies to all non governmental entities  including not for profit organizations 
sop no 
does not apply to loans originated by the entity 
the company has reviewed the implications of sop no 
but does not believe that its adoption will have a significant impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
and its related implementation guidance 
the statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the most significant change resulting from this statement is the requirement for public companies to expense employee share based payments under fair value as originally introduced in sfas no 
this statement is effective for public companies as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the company will adopt this statement effective july  and is currently evaluating the impact it will have on net income had the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 for each year presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as a financial services company  net interest income comprises the primary component of the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or re price within specified periods 
the company monitors the aggregate cash flow  projected net yield and estimated market value of its investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
the company focuses on the sensitivity of its investment portfolio cash flow  and measures such sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous  parallel  and sustained interest rate movements in basis point increments 
the company estimates its net interest income cash flow for the next twenty four months assuming interest rates over such time period follow the forward libor curve based on day eurodollar futures contracts as of december  once the base case has been estimated  cash flows are projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios 
those scenario results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to cash flow 
cash flow changes from interest rate swaps  caps  floors or any other derivative instrument are included in this analysis 
the following table summarizes the company s net interest income cash flow and market value sensitivity analyses as of december  these analyses represent management s estimate of the percentage change in net interest margin cash flow and value expressed as a percentage change of shareholders equity  given a parallel shift in interest rates  as discussed above 
other investments are excluded from this analysis because they are not considered interest rate sensitive 
the base case represents the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  at december   one month libor was and six month libor was 
the analysis is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results 
in addition  certain financial instruments provide a degree of optionality 
the most significant option affecting the company s portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each collateral pool in the investment portfolio 
the model applies the same prepayment rate assumptions for all five cases indicated below 
the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  the projected results assume no additions or subtractions to the company s portfolio  and no change to the company s liability structure 
historically  there have been significant changes in the company s investment portfolio and the liabilities incurred by the company 
as a result of anticipated prepayments on assets in the investment portfolio  there are likely to be such changes in the future 
projected change in net projected change in basis point interest margin value  expressed as a increase decrease cash flow from percentage of in interest rates base case shareholders equity base the company s interest rate risk is related both to the rate of change in short term interest rates and to the level of short term interest rates 
approximately billion of the company s investment portfolio is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates that are fixed 
approximately million of the company s investment portfolio as of december  was comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
approximately and of the adjustable rate loans underlying the company s securitized finance receivables are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six month libor and one year cmt  respectively 
generally  during a period of rising short term interest rates  the company s net interest income earned and the corresponding cash flow on its investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i fixed rate loans and investments financed with variable rate debt  ii the lag in resets of the adjustable rate loans underlying the securitized finance receivables relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings  and iii rate resets on the adjustable rate loans which are generally limited to every six months or every twelve months and subject to lifetime caps  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as to item i  the company has substantially limited its interest rate risk on such investments through x the issuance of fixed rate non recourse securitization financing which approximated million as of december   and y equity  which was million 
in addition  the company has entered into interest rate swaps and synthetic swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure on fixed rate investments financed with variable rate bonds as further discussed below 
as to items ii and iii  as short term interest rates stabilize and the adjustable rate loans reset  the net interest margin may be partially restored as the yields on the adjustable rate loans adjust to market conditions 
in addition  the company has entered into an interest rate swap to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure on million in notional value of its variable rate bonds 
the swap agreement has been constructed such that the company will pay interest at a fixed rate of on the notional amount and will receive interest based on one month libor on the same notional amount through june the impact on cash flows from the interest rate swap has been included in the table above for each of the respective interest rate scenarios 
an additional approximate million of floating rate liabilities are being converted to a fixed rate through an amortizing synthetic swap created by the short sale of a string of eurodollar futures contract in october the synthetic swap has remaining an estimated duration of years 
as of december   the weighted average fixed rate cost of the synthetic swap to the company was 
net interest income may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the adjustable rate loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements  to the extent that the company has entered into such agreements
