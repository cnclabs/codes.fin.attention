item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information is provided in connection with  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we operate on a fiscal year ending on april the following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended april  overview we are a self advised equity real estate investment trust engaged in owning and operating income producing real properties 
our investments include multi family residential properties and commercial properties located primarily in the upper midwest states of minnesota and north dakota 
our properties are diversified in property type and location 
as of april   our real estate portfolio consisted of multi family residential properties containing  apartment units and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and commercial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million 
our commercial properties consist of office properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  medical properties including assisted living facilities containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  annual report 
table of contents industrial properties including miscellaneous commercial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and retail properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total carrying amount net of accumulated depreciation of million 
our primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multi family residential and commercial leases 
our business objective is to increase shareholder value by employing a disciplined investment strategy 
this strategy is focused on growing assets in desired geographical markets  achieving diversification by property type and location  and adhering to targeted returns in acquiring properties 
during fiscal year  iret continued to operate in a difficult economic environment 
unemployment rates in our markets  job growth at a pace slower than anticipated  continued low interest rates and an abundant supply of housing  lower rental income and increased costs for tenant concessions and commercial property alternatives all contributed to continued pressure on occupancy levels at our multi family and commercial properties 
while we are seeing some slight improvement in vacancy levels  our operating environment in fiscal year continued to be challenging 
in addition  identifying potential acquisition properties that met our investment criteria remained a challenge during fiscal year a widespread demand for real estate from traditional and non traditional investors combined with lower tenant demand for commercial space and apartments resulted in a significant reduction in the investment returns from all types of real es tate 
in response to these operating conditions  during fiscal year iret was able to implement only modest rental rate increases at certain of our multi family and commercial properties  and continued to rely on rent and other tenant concessions in order to improve occupancy rates 
during fiscal year  vacancy levels in our total commercial segment properties continued to increase  to from at the end of fiscal year in the case of our commercial office portfolio  to from at the end of fiscal year in the case of our commercial medical portfolio  to from at the end of fiscal year in the case of our commercial industrial portfolio  and to from at the end of fiscal year in the case of our commercial retail portfolio 
vacancy levels also increased slightly at our total multi family residential properties  to compared to at the end of fiscal year total revenues of iret properties  our operating partnership  increased by million to million  compared to million in fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of new real estate properties 
operating income declined in fiscal year  to million from mi llion in fiscal year we estimate that rent concessions offered to tenants during the twelve months ended april   lowered our operating revenues by approximately million  compared to million for fiscal year expenses increased during fiscal year as well  with real estate taxes  maintenance  utility  administrative and operating expense all increasing from year earlier levels 
while some of this increase was due to existing real estate  the majority was due to the addition of new real estate to our portfolio 
during fiscal year  the company added four multi family residential properties with a total of apartment units  three medical properties with a total of  leasable square feet  eight office properties with a total of  leasable square feet  and two retail properties consisting of  leasable square feet to our investment portfolio  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the company disposed of properties  consisting of eight apartment complexes  five medical properties assisted living facilities  one office property  three retail properties and one parcel of undeveloped land  for sale prices totaling million 
additional information and more detailed discussions of our fiscal year operating results are found in the following sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
real estate 
real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  less an adjustment for impairment  if any 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the annual report 
table of contents costs associated with a property to its various components 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company uses a year estimated life for buildings and improvements 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and improvements that improve and or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life  generally five to ten years 
upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible assets including land  buildings and personal property  which is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and considers whether there were significant intangible assets acquired for example  above and below market leases  the value of acquired in place leases  and tenant relationships  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and acquired liabilities  and allocates the purchase price based on these assessments 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land  buildings  and personal property based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
the estimated fair value of the property is the amount that would be recoverable upon the disposition of the property 
techniques used to estimate fair value include discounted cash flow analysis  independent appraisals  and refer ence to recent sales of comparable properties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately  or based on estimated market value if acquired in a merger or in a portfolio acquisition 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the company performs this analysis on a lease by lease basis 
the capitalized above market and below market lease values are amortized and included in operating expenses as depreciation amortization related to real estate investments and amortized over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based upon the company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of the leases 
factors considered in these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the company also considers information about each property obtained during its pre acquisition due diligence and marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration is received by the company 
the company s properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows  initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different 
the impact of the company s estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the company s financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  as of april  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their respective lease agreements 
the company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  as of april  
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
if estimates differ from actual results this would impact reported results 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rents income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases 
certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease 
rental revenue is recorded for the full annual report 
table of contents term of each lease on a straight line basis 
accordingly  the company records a receivable from tenants for rents that it expects to collect over the remaining lease term as deferred rents receivable 
when the company acquires a property  the term of the existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation 
revenue recognition is considered to be critical because the evaluation of the realizability of such deferred rents receivable involves management s assumptions relating to such tenant s viability 
percentage rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition  which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
expense reimbursement income revenue arising from tenant leases  which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
income taxes 
the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
the company intends to distribute to its shareholders of its taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders  it would fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result 
the company s taxable income is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following that the company s tenants perform their obligations under their leases with the company  that the company s tax and accounting positions do not change  and that the number of issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock remain relatively unchanged 
these factors  which impact the company s taxable income  are subject to change  and many are outside the control of the company 
if actual results vary  the company s taxable income may change 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets amendment of apb opinion no 

the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations revenues total revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year revenues during fiscal year were million greater than revenues in fiscal year and revenues during fiscal year were million greater than in fiscal year annual report 
table of contents for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year decrease in rental income on existing properties  net of declining occupancy levels an increase in straight line rents for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year increase in rental income on existing properties  net of declining occupancy levels an increase in straight line rents a decrease in rent from properties sold as illustrated above  the substantial majority of the increase in our gross revenue for fiscal years and resulted from the addition of new real estate properties to the iret properties portfolio  rather than from rental increases on existing properties 
for the next months  we expect acquisitions to continue to be the most significant factor in any increases in our revenues and ultimately our net income 
while acceptable real estate assets are still available for purchase  declining tenant demand combined with a continued widespread demand for real estate from traditional and non traditional investors has resulted in a significant reduction in the investment returns from all types of real estate 
this reduction in the rates of return has been offset to some extent by the decline in borrowing costs to historically low levels 
while we were able to take advantage of those lower borrowing costs for most of our recent acquisitions  the major ity of our debt is fixed and not prepayable without significant prepayment costs and fees 
gain on sale of real estate the company realized a gain on sale of real estate for fiscal year of million 
this compares to million of gain on sale of real estate recognized in fiscal and million recognized in fiscal a list of the properties sold during fiscal year  showing sales price  depreciated cost plus sales costs and net gain loss is included below on page under the caption property dispositions

depreciation amortization related to real estate investments increased significantly in our commercial office and commercial medical segments in fiscal year compared to fiscal year increasing and  respectively  and in our commercial office segment in fiscal year compared to fiscal year increasing 
these increases were a result of the implementation of sfas no 
 which establishes standards for valuing in place leases in purchase transactions 
the company allocates a portion of the purchase price paid for properties to in place lease intangible assets 
the amortization period of these intangible assets is the term of the lease  rather than the estimated life of the building and improvements 
the company accordingly initially records additional amortization expense due to this shorter amortization period

a discussion of the factors having the greatest impact on our business compared to the prior two fiscal years is set forth below 
in management s opinion  most of these negative influences show signs of lessening in the next twelve months 
increased economic vacancy and concessions 
during fiscal year  vacancy levels at our stabilized multi family residential properties decreased slightly throughout our entire portfolio to compared to at the end of fiscal year  for economic occupancy levels of approximately in fiscal year compared to approximately in fiscal year economic occupancy is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue 
total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units or square footage at contract rates  and vacant units or square footage at market rates 
stabilized properties are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the periods being compared  and include properties that were redeveloped or expanded during the periods being compared 
however  vacancy levels at our st abilized total commercial segment properties increased to  from at the end of fiscal year  for economic occupancy levels of approximately in fiscal year compared to approximately in fiscal year a majority of the markets in which we operate continue to experience overall poor economic conditions in respect to job creation 
the poor economic climate has translated into increased vacancy at many of our properties 
while occupancy levels at our multi family residential properties showed signs of improvement during the last half of fiscal year  our level of tenant concessions has not declined significantly  and results at our multi family residential properties continue to be negatively influenced by the availability of low interest mortgages to prospective home buyers 
to maintain physical occupancy levels at our multi family residential properties  we may offer tenant incentives  generally in the form of lower rents  which results in decreased revenues and income from operations at our stabilized properties 
we estimate that rent concessions offered during fiscal year lowered our operating revenues by approximately million  as compared to an estimated approximately million reduction in operating revenues attributable to rent concessions offered in fiscal year our commercial vacancy is primarily due to our inability to either renew existing leases or to re lease space being vacated by tenants at the expiration of their lease 
while not necessarily indicative of future business cycles  in past economic downturns  a recovery in occupancy levels generally trails the pick up in economic activity by twelve months or more 
despite some positive economic developments  we have yet to see a significant increase in demand for multi family residential or commercial space 
we continue to expect that demand in our markets for both apartments and commercial space will remain weak through the remainder of our current fiscal year annual report 
table of contents increased real estate taxes 
taxes imposed on our real estate properties increased by million  or for the fiscal year ended april  of the increased real estate taxes  million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate acquired in fiscal and  while million or is due to decreased costs for real estate taxes on existing real estate assets 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of real estate tax is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
for our noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our real estate tax costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented selected rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased real estate tax costs 
increased maintenance expense 
the maintenance expense category increased by million or for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year of the increased maintenance costs for the fiscal year ended april   million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate acquired in fiscal and  while million or is due to decreased costs for maintenance on existing real estate assets 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of maintenance is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
for our noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our maintenance costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented selected rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from r aising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased maintenance costs 
increased utility expense 
the utility expense category increased by million or for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to fiscal year of the increased utility costs  million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate acquired in fiscal and  while million or is due to decreased costs for utilities on existing real estate assets 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of utilities is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
for our other noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our utility costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented selected rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased utility costs 
since our real estate portfolio is primarily located in minnesota and north dakota  the severity of winters has a large impact on our utility costs 
increased administrative and operating expense 
administrative and operating expenses increased by million or for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to fiscal year of this increase in administrative and operating expense for the fiscal year ended april   million or was due to employee related costs 
over the past year  we have hired seven new employees 
the addition of these new employees  together with increases in the wages and benefits paid to existing employees  account for a significant portion of the increase in administrative and operating costs for the fiscal year ended april  in addition  in common with other public companies  we have experienced a significant increase in accounting fees and other costs  primarily as a result of certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley  in pa rticular the internal controls report and attestation requirements of section of sarbanes oxley 
increase in mortgage interest expense 
our mortgage debt increased million or for the fiscal year ended april  our mortgage interest expense increased by million or for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to fiscal year of the increased interest expense for the fiscal year ended april   million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate  while interest expenses on existing real estate assets decreased by million or  due primarily to lower interest rates on mortgages 
increase in amortization expense 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  which establishes standards for valuing in place leases in purchase transactions  the company allocates a portion of the purchase price paid for properties to in place lease intangible assets 
the amortization period of these intangible assets is the term of the lease  rather than the estimated life of the building and improvements 
the company accordingly initially records additional amortization expense due to this shorter amortization annual report

for our noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our real estate tax costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we implemented selected rent increases  economic conditions and increased vacancy levels prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased real estate tax costs 
to further compound the problem  a number of states in which we operate continued to face state budget shortfalls 
our experience is that such shortfalls translate into local governments raising property taxes

prior lake ii prior lake  mn total fiscal property dispositions funds from operations iret considers funds from operations ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit 
iret uses the definition of ffo adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit in  as clarified in  and nareit defines ffo to mean net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
because of limitations of the ffo definition adopted by nareit  iret has made certain interpretations in applying the definition 
iret believes all such interpretations not specifically provided for in the nareit definition are consistent with the defini tion 
iret management considers that ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  the gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate properties and extraordinary items as defined by gaap  is useful to investors in providing an additional perspective on iret s operating results 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation  that the value of real estate assets decreases predictably over time 
however  real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
nareit s definition of ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  reflects the fact that real estate  as an asset class  generally appreciates over time and that depreciation charges required by gaap may not reflect underlying economic realities 
additionally  the exclusion  in nareit s definition of ffo  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real esta te assets  allows iret management and investors better to identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of iret s investments  and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
ffo is used by iret s management and investors to identify trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs 
while ffo is widely used by reits as a primary performance metric  not all real estate companies use the same definition of ffo or calculate ffo in the same way 
accordingly  ffo presented here is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of iret s performance  but rather should be considered as an additional  supplemental measure  and should be viewed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  and is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of iret s needs or its ability to service indebtedness or make distributions
