item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december    and results of operations overview we provide services and products primarily focused on the repair and healing of the musculoskeletal system 
our services and technology are associated with making human tissue safe for transplantation and for use in a variety of surgical procedures 
based on our knowledge of the allograft bone tissue industry  we believe that we are one of the world s largest processor and developer of human bone and bone connective tissue 
the allograft bone tissue we process is procured by independent tissue banks and other tissue recovery organizations  or tro s  primarily through the donation of tissue from deceased human donors and is used for transplantation 
we process allograft bone tissue for our clients from allograft bone tissue provided by them  and also for ourselves from allograft bone tissue recovered by tro s and tissue banks for us in our two primary business segments  the dbm segment and the base tissue segment 
for our proprietary products  grafton dbm and graftech bio implants  we perform the medical education to teach surgeons about the uses of these tissue forms and our clients and or we generally distribute and invoice for these tissue forms to hospitals and surgeons 
we expect over the next several years to continue to expand our direct distribution efforts and expect that revenues from these efforts will continue to grow 
to further that objective  we executed the second mtf processing agreement on december   which became effective on january  upon the consummation of mtf s acquisition of arc s allograft tissue banking operation 
pursuant to the second mtf processing agreement  mtf will provide a certain number of standard donors for processing from which traditional allograft bone tissue forms will be processed and labeled with the mtf company name and which mtf will market and distribute to end users 
grafton dbm and graftech bio implants will also be processed from these standard donors  but will be labeled with our product and company names and will be marketed and distributed to end users by us 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were generated from our direct distribution efforts 
in addition  we also process two private label dbm product lines for non related organizations 
they are responsible for marketing  distributing and billing these tissue forms to end users 
we believe the use of private label arrangements is effective in bringing our products and technology to markets that are not a primary distribution outlet for our sales force 
we will seek to continue to enter into private label arrangements  as appropriate  and as available tissue supplies allow 
we continue to make investments in our business as a result of our direct distribution strategy and these investments have  and may in the future  impact our liquidity and cash flow 
we have and continue to make additional investments in deferred processing costs processed and unprocessed tissue inventories  which have and may continue to deplete our available cash balance 
as a greater percentage of our revenues are generated from direct shipments to hospitals and surgeons  which typically pay invoices more slowly than our tissue bank customer base  we expect that our investment in accounts receivable will increase 
we believe that available cash  cash equivalents  available lines of credit and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet forecasted cash needs in however  we may seek additional funding to meet the needs of our strategic plan 
there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available  or if available  that such funds will be available on favorable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and may adjust them based upon the latest information available to us 
these estimates generally include those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories including purchase commitments  deferred processing costs including reserves for rework  excess and obsolescence  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which would increase our operating costs 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated returns based upon historical experience 
if future returns are less than our historical experience  reduction in estimated reserves would increase revenue 
alternatively  should returns exceed historical experience  additional allowances would be required  which would reduce revenue 
we write down inventory and deferred processing costs for estimated excess  obsolescence or unmarketable products and allograft bone tissue forms equal to the difference between cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
excess and obsolescence could occur from numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the competitive nature of the market  technological change  expiration and changes in surgeon preference 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required  including provisions to reduce inventory and deferred processing costs to net realizable value 
in addition  we provide reserves  if any  for the difference between our contractual purchase commitments and our projected purchasing patterns based upon the maintenance of adequate inventory levels and forecasted revenues 
if actual revenue is less favorable than those forecasted by management  additional reserves may be required  alternatively  if revenue is stronger than forecasted by management  such reserves would be reduced 
we depreciate amortize our property  plant and equipment based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
in addition  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if we determine that a change is required in the useful life of an asset  future depreciation amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  should we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on its fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we accrue current and future tax liabilities based upon levels of taxable income  tax planning strategies and assessments of the timing of taxability of tax attributes 
while we have considered current tax laws in establishing our tax liabilities  in the event we were to settle our tax liabilities for less than amounts accrued we would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine it would cost us more to settle our tax liabilities  an adjustment would be charged to income thus reducing income in that period 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and we are unable to predict the outcome of the pending suits or claims 
when we are reasonably able to determine the probable minimum or ultimate liability  if any  which may result from any of the pending litigation  we will record a provision for such liability  and if appropriate  will record a benefit for the amounts covered by insurance 
if the outcome or resolution of the pending suit or claim is for amounts greater than we have accrued  an adjustment will be charged to income in the period the determination is made 
alternatively  should the suit or claim be for less than we have accrued  we would increase income in the period the determination is made 
service agreements mtf and arc on january   we were notified that mtf completed its acquisition of the allograft tissue banking operations of arc 
upon our receipt of such notification  the arc termination agreement  which terminates the arc processing agreement  and the second mtf processing agreement became effective 
under the second mtf processing agreement  mtf will provide us with a certain amount of standard donors for processing that is equivalent to the amount of standard donors that was to be delivered to us by arc under the terms of the arc processing agreement 
the second mtf processing agreement has an initial term that expires on december   and may be extended for two additional one year periods if certain conditions contained in the agreement are met 
there are no changes to or impact on the first mtf processing agreement resulting from mtf s acquisition of arc s tissue banking operations  the arc termination agreement or the second mtf processing agreement 
we don t believe we will suffer any material negative impact from mtf s acquisition of arc s tissue banking operations  the arc termination agreement or the second mtf processing agreement 
based upon the number of donors we expect to receive under the first and second mtf processing agreements and our additional  multiple sources of allograft donor tissue  we expect to be able to meet the anticipated market demand for our grafton dbm  graftech bio implants and traditional tissue product lines 
we believe we will have sufficient tissue supply necessary to continue to implement our plans to grow and expand our revenue base both domestically and internationally 
revenues generated from arc were   and  in  and  respectively 
revenues generated from mtf were   and  in  and  respectively 
cessation of marketing and distribution efforts for metal spinal implant products in march  we announced that we would cease  and on june  we ceased marketing and distribution efforts for all metal spinal implant product lines 
revenues generated from metal spinal implants were   and  in  and  respectively 
as a result of these activities  we recorded a charge to cost of product of  in first quarter for excess and obsolete inventory and instrument sets related to this decision 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold all remaining inventory  instrumentation and intellectual property related to our ovation polyaxial system ovation to an unrelated private company for million in cash 
we recorded a gain on the sale of the intellectual property in the amount  which is reflected in other income in our consolidated statement of operations and reversed  of the aforementioned charge recorded in the first quarter of temporary suspension of base tissue segment processing on september   we voluntarily and temporarily suspended base tissue segment processing due to higher than normal incidence of sterility failures on finished forms of processed allograft bone tissue  which occurred in our eatontown facility  and subsequently  in our shrewsbury facility 
in addition  as a precaution  we voluntarily retrieved certain tissue from whole donors and five individual pieces of tissue from five different donors that had previously been shipped to clients although all such tissue was tested and found sterile 
in october   we restarted base tissue segment processing in our shrewsbury facility  and in november  we restarted base tissue segment processing in our eatontown facility 
as a result of the temporary suspension of base tissue segment processing  we placed tissue processed in third quarter from donors in quarantine 
we released a portion of the quarantined tissue in and and expect to release the remainder in we initially recorded an estimated provision for the cost to rework this tissue and we still believe this provision was adequate 
these events negatively impacted our operating results 
we have estimated that the third quarter base tissue segment revenues were negatively impacted by approximately  and gross profit was impacted by the lost revenues and by the  estimated cost to rework the tissue in quarantine 
we have estimated that the fourth quarter base tissue segment revenues were negatively impacted by approximately  while gross profit was impacted by the lost revenues and the effects of negative production variances  which we estimate were approximately  income loss from continuing operations we incurred a consolidated loss from continuing operations of  or 
diluted loss per share in compared to consolidated income from continuing operations in of  or 
diluted income per share 
we incurred a consolidated loss from continuing operations in of  or 
diluted loss per share 
in  the loss from continuing operations included pre tax charges of  for the impairment of certain assets that as of december  will no longer be utilized in the processing of allograft bone tissue related to our former processing environment located at our facility in shrewsbury   associated with a severance charge for the reorganization of our sales and marketing organizations  and  associated with the provisions for our exit from our metal spinal implant product lines 
the consolidated loss from continuing operations in was negatively impacted by a disproportional effective tax rate due to the recording of valuation allowances to reduce domestic state income taxes to estimated realizable value as a result of our assessment that the realization of such future state tax benefits is uncertain 
these charges were partially offset by the pre tax gains associated with the sale of ovation of  and the reversal of reserves associated with the settlement of the alphatec litigation of  in  income from continuing operations included a pre tax gain of  related to the settlement of certain patent litigation 
in  the loss from continuing operations included pre tax charges of  for the estimated cost to rework the tissue from donors placed in quarantine in the third quarter of  a reserve of  for the penalty associated with metal spinal implants  primarily affirm  that we did not expect to purchase  which were subject to a purchase commitment   for excess and obsolete inventory related to spinal implant systems  including the bio d threaded cortical bone dowel  which we removed from the market on january  in connection with the lawsuit settlement with medtronic  inc  and  associated with payment to medtronic in connection with the litigation settlement 
the charges were partially offset by the recognition of an income tax benefit of  related to liabilities for tax benefits recorded in that are no longer required and a pre tax gain of  related to the sale of the polyactive polymer biomaterial technology and patents to isotis bv 
we incurred a consolidated loss from continuing operations before taxes of  in compared to a consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes of  in and a consolidated loss from continuing operations before income taxes of  in discontinued operations effective june   we completed the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets  including the assumption of certain liabilities  of our operations in leiden  the netherlands for  in cash and a non interest bearing note with a face value of  which we discounted based on the acquirer s incremental borrowing rate of 
these operations represented our ceramic and titanium plasma spray coating services and products 
we recognized a loss on the sale of this business of  in revenues and net income from this business in through the date of the sale were  and  respectively 
net income loss consolidated net loss in was  or 
diluted net loss per share compared to a consolidated net income of  or 
diluted net income per share in and a consolidated net loss in of  or

the following is a discussion of factors affecting results of operations for the years ended december    and after giving effect to the divestiture of the operations of our subsidiary in the netherlands in net revenues consolidated net revenues declined in to  from consolidated net revenues of  in the decline in consolidated net revenues was primarily due to the loss of revenues associated with metal spinal implant product lines of  as a result of our exit from this portion of our business effective june   and the decline in domestic unit volumes in our two primary business segments  the dbm segment and the base tissue segment  partially offset by increased unit volume from our international operations  and the favorable impact of exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro of approximately  consolidated net revenues increased in to  compared to consolidated revenues of  in the increase in was primarily due to increased revenues in all segments  mainly as a result of increased unit volume and  to a lesser extent  by price increases effective january  and the favorable impact of exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro of approximately  consolidated revenues in were negatively impacted by the temporary suspension of base tissue segment processing operations  which resulted in the placing of allograft bone tissue in quarantine that otherwise would have been released and invoiced to our clients  and by the suspension of sales of affirm 
dbm segment revenues  which consists primarily of domestic and international grafton dbm revenues and revenues from the processing of two private label dbms  declined slightly in to  from revenues of  in the decline in dbm segment revenues is primarily due to a decline in domestic grafton dbm revenues to  from  in  partially offset by a increase in international grafton dbm revenues to  from  in and a increase in private label dbm revenues to  from  in domestic grafton dbm revenues declined primarily due to a decline in unit volume due to continued strong competition which we have been unsuccessful in overcoming to date  partially offset by incremental revenues of approximately  due to our capturing more of the end user sale price as a result of our direct distribution efforts 
international grafton dbm revenues increased in over primarily due to increased unit volume and the impact of favorable exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
private label dbm revenue increased primarily due to entering into the second private label arrangement with smith nephew in april  we began shipments to smith nephew in july  dbm segment revenues increased to  in from  in the increase in principally relates to a increase in international grafton dbm revenues as well as revenues from the private label dbm processed for lifenet  partially offset by a decline in domestic grafton dbm revenues 
we expect domestic grafton dbm will continue to face significant competition as more companies develop and market dbm products with similar characteristics  synthetic products and growth factors 
base tissue segment revenues declined in to  from  in the decline in base tissue segment revenues in is primarily attributable to a decline in world wide base tissue processing fees to  in compared to  in resulting from processing fewer donors for our clients and a decline in domestic graftech bio implant revenues to  from  in due to a decline in units volume and increased pricing pressures 
these declines were partially offset by a increase in revenues to  in from  in from our world wide direct distribution of traditional allograft bone tissue forms and the international distribution of osteopure femoral head allograft bone tissue forms 
base tissue segment revenues increased in to  from  in  primarily due to a increase in revenues from the processing of donor tissue for our clients and a increase in bio implant revenues resulting from an increase in unit volume and the january  price increase 
base tissue segment revenues were negatively impacted in from the temporary suspension of base tissue segment processing 
revenues from other product lines mainly relate to metal spinal implant products and bovine tissue 
in january  we announced that we would terminate the distribution agreement dated february  with spinevision  sa and spinevision  inc in accordance with the provisions of the agreement effective february  in addition  we announced in march  that we would discontinue marketing and distributing all remaining metal spinal implant product lines on june  revenues generated from metal spinal implants were   and  in  and  respectively 
revenues from other product lines declined in to  compared to  primarily due to our decision to exit the metal spinal implant business 
metal spinal implant revenues declined  in compared to as a result of this decision 
revenues from other product lines increased in to  from revenues of  the increase in primarily relates to revenues from the three metal spinal implant systems we were distributing for spinevision  partially offset by a decline in bovine revenues and the suspension of sales of affirm 
domestic net revenues declined to  in compared to domestic net revenues in of  the decline in domestic net revenues in is primarily due to the decline in unit volume in our primary product lines  grafton dbm  graftech bio implants and base tissue processing fees 
in addition  revenues from metal spinal implant product lines declined by  as a result of our decision to exit the metal spinal implant business effective june  domestic net revenues increased to  in from  in  primarily as a result of increased base allograft tissue processing revenues  revenues from the private label dbm processed for lifenet  increased bio implant revenues  revenues from the three metal spinal implant systems we distributed for spinevision and annual price increases  partially offset by a decline in domestic grafton dbm revenues and the loss of revenue related to the suspension of sales of affirm 
foreign based revenues increased to  in and increased to  in from  in the increase in foreign based revenues in and was due principally to increased unit volume in all allograft bone tissue product lines and the favorable impact of exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
during   and  two of our clients  mtf and arc  in the dbm and base tissue segments  together accounted for  and of consolidated net revenues  respectively 
effective january   we have two processing agreements with mtf and the processing agreement with arc was terminated 
see item clients  service agreements mtf and arc included elsewhere herein in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these processing agreements 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was in  in and in the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in is primarily attributable to the charge associated with the impairment of certain assets that as of december  will no longer be utilized to process allograft bone tissue related to our former processing environment located at our facility in shrewsbury of  the decline in unit production volume resulting from the decline in revenues  which has negatively impacted our ability to absorb fixed costs  and the charges  net of gains  associated with our exit from the metal spinal implant business 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in compared to was principally due to the increase in revenues  which improved the absorption of fixed costs 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was negatively impacted in primarily due to pre tax charges of  for the estimated cost to rework the tissue from donors placed in quarantine in  excess and obsolete inventory related to spinal implant systems and reserves for metal spinal implants that we did not expect to purchase  which were subject to a firm purchase commitment  the decline in base tissue processing revenues due to the temporary suspension of base tissue processing  the decline in donors processed for our clients  and the negative impact of underabsorption of production variances due to the temporary suspension of base tissue processing 
we expect that gross profits as a percentage of revenues will improve slightly in as compared to  primarily due to cost savings associated with the shutdown of our former processing environment located in shrewsbury  partially offset by the anticipated continued shift in our business model to direct distribution from client processing and the anticipated growth of our international operations 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas no 
 which requires  among other items  that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
see recent accounting development elsewhere herein this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
based on our internal projections and assessments  we currently believe that there will be no material impact on our future results of operations from the adoption of sfas no 
however  if our actual results are materially less than our projections and expectations  and as a result  our production levels are less then the range of normal capacity  certain provisions of sfas no 
may have a material impact on our future results of operations 
such impact will only be determinable based on the actual facts and circumstances 
marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly in to  compared to expenses of  primarily due to the severance costs associated with the reorganization of our sales and marketing departments in the first quarter of  the costs associated with our think tank marketing and sales program  and the out of pocket costs of  incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  partially offset by lower domestic commission expenses due to the decline in domestic revenues 
in  marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses were  compared to expenses of  marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat in compared to primarily due to a reduction in legal fees and the rescission of our funding of the american tissue services foundation  partially offset by increased costs for marketing and sales programs  an increase in the number of our direct sales representatives  increased commissions related to increased revenues  and an approximate increase in the effective commission rate for domestic grafton dbm revenues effective july  we expect marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses to increase significantly in compared to as a result of increased spending on sales and marketing programs and initiatives  increased commission costs related to anticipated increased revenues  increased costs associated with initiatives to continue to expand our donor sources and personnel and other related costs 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to  in as compared to  in the increase in was primarily attributable to our efforts to develop extensions of existing product lines  continued development of new product lines  including our plexus technology  and the development of new processing methodologies and technologies  including a terminal sterilization process for the allograft bone tissue we process 
in  research and development expenses were  compared to research and development expenses of  research and development expenses were relatively flat in compared to as existing projects continued to be developed and new projects were started after other projects were completed 
we expect research and development costs to increase in as compared to primarily due to continued funding of existing projects  including the costs  which may range between  and  associated with the license agreement with rutgers  the state university of new jersey  to continue to advance our plexus technology 
income charge from litigation settlement in  we settled all claims arising out of a patent lawsuit and the other party agreed to pay us an aggregate of  in october   we received the initial payment of  in cash  an interest bearing  promissory note and a  letter of credit collateralizing the promissory note 
in connection with this settlement  we recognized pre tax income of  in in april   we settled a patent lawsuit and agreed to pay an aggregate of  in equal monthly installments without interest 
we recorded a charge of  related to this settlement representing the present value of the amounts due 
operating income loss we incurred a consolidated operating loss of  in compared to consolidated operating income of  in dbm segment operating income declined to  in from  in the decline in dbm segment operating income in is primarily due a change in revenue mix from higher gross margin products domestic grafton dbm to lower gross margin products international grafton dbm  private label dbms and the domestic direct distribution of grafton dbm  the general decline in unit volume  which resulted in the underabsorption of fixed overheads  increased operating expenses associated with the shift of sales and marketing resources from marketing metal spinal implant products to focus on our tissue businesses  and a portion of the severance costs related to the reorganization of the sales and marketing departments 
dbm segment operating income in included income of  from the settlement of certain patent litigation 
we incurred an operating loss in the base tissue segment of  in compared to an operating income in the base tissue segment of  in the operating losses in are primarily attributable to the decline in revenues related to base tissue processing activities and domestic distribution of graftech bio implants  the decline in unit volume  increased operating expenses associated with programs to restore revenue growth  including the shift of sales and marketing resources from marketing metal spinal implant products to focus on our tissue businesses  a portion of the severance costs related to the reorganization of the sales and marketing departments  and the charge associated with the impairment of our former processing environment 
operating losses associated with other revenues were  and  in and  respectively 
the operating loss in is primarily associated with our metal spinal implant business  which we exited in june  and relates mainly to the provisions to reduce metal spinal implant inventory and instrumentation to net realizable value and legal fees associated with the alphatec lawsuit  partially offset by the reversal of  of the aforementioned reserve for metal spinal implant inventory due to the sale of the ovation inventory 
consolidated operating income in was  compared to a consolidated operating loss of  in dbm segment operating income increased in to  from  in the increase in dbm segment operating income in results principally from the income of  from the settlement of certain patent litigation  increased revenues and a decline in operating expenses  primarily due to lower legal fees 
operating income in the base tissue segment was  in compared to an operating loss in of  in the improvement in operating income in compared to results primarily from increased revenues  the impacts in on revenue and gross profit related to the temporary suspension of base tissue processing and a number of reserves and provisions recorded in related to rework reserves  excess and obsolete bio d threaded cortical bone dowel inventory and the litigation settlement charge  partially offset by increased operating expenses in associated with sales and marketing programs 
operating losses associated with other revenues were  and  in and  respectively 
the operating loss in results primarily from metal spinal implant revenues for which there is not sufficient unit volume to cover overhead costs  and increased legal fees 
other income expense other income of  in related mainly to the gain on the sale of the intellectual property associated with ovation of  foreign currency translation gains on intercompany debt  interest income of  partially offset by interest expense on our long term debt of  other expense of  in related primarily to interest expense on our long term debt of  partially offset by interest income on available cash balance of  and foreign currency translation gains associated with the impact of exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro on intercompany debt 
in fourth quarter  as a result of a decision to utilize excess cash flow  if any  generated by our french subsidiary to repay the remaining outstanding balance of its intercompany debt  in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  we recognized the impact of foreign currency translation gains and losses on the outstanding balance of the intercompany debt in our results of operations 
foreign currency translation gains of  and  were recognized in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the impact of exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
future translation gains and losses may have a material impact on our results of operations in the event of significant changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  although the impact of such gains and losses should not have any impact on consolidated cash flows 
income tax provision in  we provided a benefit for income taxes related mainly to losses in our domestic operations  mostly offset by a provision for income taxes for our french subsidiary and a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance for domestic state deferred tax assets of  the valuation allowance was established in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
the assessment under sfas no 
is required to be performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
aggregate cumulative losses generated by our domestic operation over the last several years and the expected loss from our domestic operation in represents sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
to require the establishment of a valuation allowance 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of such valuation allowances 
we will continue to assess the need to maintain existing valuation allowances or to record additional valuation allowances based on facts and circumstances in each future period 
due to the anticipated loss from operations in  we anticipate we will record additional valuation allowances in  which will negatively impact our financial results 
our effective income tax rate in was 
the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory income tax rate principally due to the impact of domestic state income taxes  partially offset by federal and state tax credits 
in  we provided a benefit for income taxes primarily due to losses in our domestic operations and our ability to carryback and carryforward these losses 
we did not recognize any income taxes on foreign income in due primarily to our ability to utilize previously unrecognized foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which carry a full valuation allowance 
in addition  we reversed liabilities for previously deferred tax benefits of  that are no longer required 
in  we utilized approximately  of historical foreign net operating loss carryforwards to offset foreign taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had cash and short term investments of  compared to  at december  we invest excess cash in us government backed securities and investment grade commercial paper of major us corporations 
working capital increased slightly to  at december  compared to  at december  this increase resulted primarily from additional investments in deferred processing fees in order to continue to expand available inventories and increase our overall tissue position  partially offset by the disposal of metal spinal implant inventories due to our exit from these product lines and valuation allowances for state deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the realization of these future tax benefits 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  in the decline resulted primarily from the net loss in compared to net income in  partially offset by a decline in our level of investment in deferred processing costs 
net cash used in investing activities was  in and is principally due to capital expenditures  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the ovation intellectual property 
net cash provided by investing activities of  in was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of investments  partially offset by capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities in and of  and  respectively  relates primarily to principal payments on long term debt  which included an additional principal payment in of  from the proceeds of the ovation transaction  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
we have a credit facility with a us bank that includes a  revolving line of credit  a building mortgage loan and a term loan 
at december    was outstanding under the building mortgage loan and  was outstanding under the equipment term loan 
in  to support the  due under the settlement of certain patent litigation  we provided an irrevocable standby letter of credit 
the final payment due under the litigation settlement was paid in april  and the letter of credit terminated at that time 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit and the full amount was available 
pursuant to an april  amendment to the credit facility  the revolving line of credit expires on april  at which time all amounts outstanding are due and payable and all remaining commitments are cancelled 
the credit facility  as amended  is collateralized by domestic accounts receivable  domestic inventories  the company s allograft tissue processing facility  including all equipment and improvements therein and a pledge of of the company s ownership in its foreign subsidiaries 
the credit facility imposes certain restrictive operating and financial covenants on the company 
effective december   pursuant to a march  amendment to the credit facility  our lender amended the definition of the operating coverage financial ratio  deleted the financial covenants related to working capital and the current and quick ratios  and imposed two new financial covenants related to maximum levels of capital expenditures and liquidity 
to maintain compliance with the new liquidity covenant  we will need to have a certain minimum level of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in comparison to our debt level as of the end of each of our fiscal quarters  although there are no restrictions on our use of any of these funds 
we complied with all financial covenants  as amended  including the liquidity covenant as of december  if we had been unable to negotiate the above noted amendment to the credit facility  we would not have complied with one of the financial covenants as of december  based on our expected debt levels  we will need to have cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of    and  as of march   june   september  and december   respectively  in order to comply with the new liquidity covenant 
based on our current projections and assessments  we believe we will be in compliance with the liquidity covenant at each of the dates mentioned above  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with this covenant on any of the required dates 
the credit facility contains additional covenants including a restriction on the payment of cash dividends  a restriction on incurring or maintaining additional indebtedness  a restriction on selling assets or engaging in mergers or acquisitions and limitations on cash advances to the company s foreign operations and investments 
pursuant to an april  amendment to the credit facility  the company can incur up to million in capital leases and up to million in lines of credit for its foreign subsidiaries 
the credit facility also includes subjective acceleration provisions 
such provisions are based upon  in the reasonable opinion of the bank  the occurrence of any adverse or material change in the condition or affairs  financial or otherwise  of the company which impairs the interests of the bank 
the bank also has the right to approve  in advance  the form and substance of any equity capital transaction  except for a common stock transaction resulting in the issuance of less than of the total issued and outstanding capital stock of the company as of the date of such transaction 
based on our expected financial performance  our compliance with our bank covenants  as amended  in  and our expected compliance with our bank covenants in  we continue to classify the long term portion of our outstanding bank debt as long term 
however  there can be no assurance that our financial performance will improve or that we will comply with our bank covenants in the future 
failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in a default under this loan facility 
following a default  the bank may determine not to make any additional financing available under the revolving line of credit  could accelerate any portion of or all of the outstanding indebtedness and could foreclose on the real and personal property securing the loans 
at december   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of  primarily to offset new jersey taxable income  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through we have provided valuation allowances for all of the state net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from these net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we have state research and development  manufacturing and other credits of  primarily to offset new jersey income taxes  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through at december   our subsidiary in the netherlands has net operating loss carryforwards aggregating  expiring in varying amounts beginning through we have not recognized any benefit from these net operating loss carryforwards in the consolidated financial statements because realization of the future tax benefits is uncertain

in february   we entered into a distribution agreement with alphatec to market two metal spinal implant systems 
this agreement required us to make minimum purchase commitments of  over the two year period beginning on april  or pay a shortfall penalty of 
in october   pursuant to a letter agreement  alphatec waived the purchase commitment of  for the first year of the commitment period for a payment of  the purchase commitment was  for the second year of the commitment period 
in  we suspended the sale and distribution of one of the alphatec metal spinal implant systems 
due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the re introduction of this product into the market  we established a provision for all implant inventory and instrumentation of  and recorded a reserve of  for the estimated penalty for the second year commitment  since we did not expect to purchase sufficient inventory to satisfy the purchase commitment 
in july   alphatec filed an action against us arising out of the distribution agreement and in august   we answered alphatec s complaint and asserted counterclaims 
in september   we executed a settlement agreement with alphatec resolving all disputes between the parties and dismissing with prejudice all claims and counterclaims 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we made a payment to alphatec in the amount of  and returned to alphatec all remaining inventory held by us that had been manufactured by alphatec 
as a result of the settlement  we reversed a portion of the reserves recorded in in the amount of  see item  legal proceedings and note to notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

we expect to continue to make investments in our business to support our direct distribution efforts and future programs and initiatives  which may deplete our available cash balances 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  available lines of credit and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals  if any  which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development  or those commercialized products whose regulatory status may change  and the resources we devote to the development  manufacture and marketing of our services and products 
we may seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plan 
we can provide no assurance that such additional funds will be available  or if available  that such funds will be available on favorable terms 
recent accounting developments in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 and in december  fasb issued a revised fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 collectively referred to as fin  both of which address consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin expanded the criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated by a business entity  and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities which include  but are not limited to  special purpose entities  or spe s to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and the adoption of this portion of fin had no impact on our results of operation  cash flows  or financial position 
fin applies in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not have any spe s or other agreements in which the counter party would be considered a variable interest entity  and therefore  adoption of fin had no impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in november   the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas no 
 which is the result of the fasb s efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
sfas no 
requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities  with unfavorable fixed production overhead cost variances to be charged to operations currently and favorable fixed production overhead cost variances to be included in the costs of conversion 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   but earlier adoption is permitted 
we have elected to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  based on our internal projections and assessments  we currently believe that there will be no material impact on our results of operations from the adoption of sfas no 
however  if our actual results are materially less than our projections and expectations and as a result our production levels are less than the range of normal capacity  certain provisions of sfas no 
may have a material impact on our results of operations 
such impact will only be determinable based on the actual facts and circumstances 
in december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciations rights 
sfas no 
r will require us to expense sbp awards as compensation costs for sbp transactions measured at fair value 
sfas no 
r is effective beginning in our third quarter of in anticipation of the issuance of this new accounting standard and to provide additional incentive to our employees  our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options with an exercise price greater than  the closing price of our common stock on december  stock options representing  shares of common stock were vested immediately as a result of this board action 
although we are still evaluating the impact of applying the various provisions of sfas no 
r  we currently believe we will recognize between  and  of incremental pre tax compensation expense in our statement of operations related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we intend to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
we are currently evaluating our long term incentive plan related to the issuance of stock options  but no decisions have been made 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation 
we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations for material changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
as our foreign operations continue to grow and represent a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues and profits  foreign currency translation adjustments will impact our operating results to a greater extent 
the exchange rate as of december  was us dollars to one euro compared to an exchange rate of us dollars to one euro as of december  the average exchange rate for the year ended december  was us dollars to one euro compared to an average exchange rate for the year ended december  of us dollars to one euro 
a change in the average exchange rate  based on actual results for  would impact revenues by approximately  and net income loss by approximately  in fourth quarter  as a result of a decision to utilize excess cash flow  if any  generated by our french subsidiary to repay the remaining outstanding balance of its intercompany debt  in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  we recognized the impact of foreign currency translation gains and losses on the outstanding balance of the intercompany debt in our results of operations 
foreign currency translation gains of  and  were recognized in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the impact of exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
future translation gains and losses may have a material impact on our results of operations in the event of significant changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  although the impact of such gains and losses should not have any impact on consolidated cash flows 
foreign currency exchange fluctuations did not have a material impact on results of operations in litigation we are involved in various legal proceedings involving product liability and other matters and claims 
for a complete discussion of these matters see  item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or as a result of the costs of contesting such lawsuits 
risk factors we may need to secure additional financing to fund our long term strategic plan 
we expect to continue to make investments in our business to support our direct distribution efforts and future programs and initiatives  which may deplete our available cash balances 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  available lines of credit and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals  if any  which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development  or those commercialized products whose regulatory status may change  and the resources we devote to the development  manufacture and marketing of our services and products 
we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity and or debt financing in private placements or public offerings to provide funds to meet the needs of our long term strategic plan 
additional funds may not be available  or if available  may not be available on favorable terms 
further equity financings  if obtained  may substantially dilute the interest of our pre existing shareholders 
any additional debt financings may contain restrictive terms that limit our operating flexibility 
as a result  any future financings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
failure to comply with covenants under our loan and security agreement could materially adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit  an equipment term loan and a mortgage 
it also imposes on us certain restrictive operating and financial covenants 
the covenants significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to make capital expenditures  advance or incur additional indebtedness  create liens on our assets  pay dividends  sell assets  engage in mergers or acquisitions  or make investments without the consent of the bank 
failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in a default under this loan facility 
over the last several years we have obtained waivers to or amendments of our credit facility without which we would not have complied with one of our financial covenants 
the loan facility also includes subjective acceleration provisions 
such provisions are based upon  in the reasonable opinion of the bank  the occurrence of any adverse or material change in our condition or affairs  financial or otherwise  which impairs the interests of the bank 
following a default  the lender may determine not to make any additional financing available under the revolving line of credit  could accelerate the indebtedness under the revolving line of credit  the equipment term loan and or the mortgage  and could foreclose on the real and personal property securing the loans 
foreclosure would adversely affect our continued operations and our ability to repay the indebtedness under the loan facility 
we may not have the funds to repay the debt upon acceleration 
our cash flows may be adversely impacted by our focus on direct distribution 
commencing in  we began to distribute tissue forms directly to surgeons and hospitals 
we expect to continue to expand our direct distribution efforts to surgeons and hospitals in future periods 
as a result  we expect that revenues from direct distribution of tissue will grow significantly as a percentage of our consolidated revenues over the next several years 
this change in distribution methodology has impacted and may negatively impact our future cash flow 
as a greater percentage of our revenues are generated from direct shipments to hospitals and other healthcare providers  which typically pay invoices more slowly than our historical customer base  our accounts receivable balances may increase  therefore negatively impacting our cash flow 
we are dependent upon one client who may provide up to of our revenues 
we are a processor of allograft bone tissue for large national and international not for profit organizations 
during  mtf accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
we entered into a non exclusive processing agreement with mtf in june   which expires on december  in addition  in and up through january   we had an exclusive processing agreement with arc  which was terminated effective upon the sale of the assets of arc s tissue banking operations to mtf 
arc accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues in in contemplation of mtf s acquisition of arc s tissue banking operations  we entered into a second processing agreement with mtf  which expires on december  unless extended in accordance with the agreement  which requires mtf to provide us with the same level of standard donors as was to be supplied by arc 
see item 
clients for a more detailed discussion of these arrangements 
the loss of mtf as a client or a substantial reduction in the amount of allograft bone tissue which we process for mtf would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence upon a limited supply of human donors may curtail business expansion 
our allograft bone tissue processing business primarily depends upon the availability of bone and related connective tissue from human donors recovered by our clients  tro s and tissue banks that recover donated human cadaveric tissue for us or internationally from our own efforts 
we rely on the efforts of not for profit donor procurement agencies  including our current clients  to educate the public and foster an increased willingness to donate bone tissue 
these organizations may not be able to find a sufficient number of persons willing to donate  or may not be willing to provide  sufficient amounts of tissue to meet present or future demand for either allograft bone tissue or any allograft bone tissue based osteogenic materials we are developing 
although we have taken steps to address this tissue supply problem  we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful in the future or that we will otherwise be able to secure a sufficient supply of tissue 
our inability to secure enough donor tissue to meet our demands could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face strong competitive threats from firms with greater financial resources and lower costs 
the allograft bone tissue we process competes in the bone graft market with autograft bone tissue  synthetic bone void fillers  growth factors and allograft bone tissue processed by others 
autograft bone tissue has traditionally been the primary choice for surgeons and we believe autograft bone tissue still represents approximately half of the united states bone graft market 
in the international marketplace  autograft bone tissue along with bone graft substitutes  such as bovine bone tissue and synthetics  currently comprise most of the bone grafting market 
many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
for numerous circumstances and procedures for which autograft bone tissue transplantation is either not feasible or not desirable  there are a number of competing alternatives available  including allograft bone tissue processed by others and bone graft substitutes 
we believe that a majority of the cadaveric bone banks operating in the united states are engaged in processing allograft bone tissue for transplantation 
many of these bone tissue banks are not for profit organizations  and  as such  they may be able to supply processing services at a lower cost than we can 
several for profit companies  certain of which have substantially greater resources then we do  are processing  marketing and distributing allograft tissue 
we compete with such entities on the basis of our advanced processing technology and the quality and quantity of the bone tissue our processing yields 
since we introduced our allograft bone tissue processing technology in  certain competing processors have claimed to have developed technology similar to that which we use 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the area of allograft bone tissue processing and distribution 
in recent years  our grafton dbm and graftech bio implant products have faced increasing competitive pressures as more companies have developed  or have announced they are developing  products with characteristics similar to these products 
certain of those competitors have  in turn  partnered with large orthopaedic and spine companies to market the competing products they have developed 
we expect that this competition will continue in the future 
many of these competitors have research and development  marketing and other resources that are significantly greater than ours 
they also offer a full line of metal implants and other products used in spinal surgeries 
this could give them a competitive advantage over us since they can offer surgeons a more complete line of products than we can 
our revenues will depend upon reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems 
the continued ability of our clients to pay our processing charges for the processing of allograft bone tissue depends upon our or our clients ability to distribute processed allograft bone tissue and collect fees from end users  which are typically hospitals 
the ability of hospitals to pay fees for allograft bone tissue depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments will continue to be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
we may have difficulty gaining market acceptance for our products and services if government and third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement 
the medical community could choose not to use our allograft bone tissue products 
we believe the market for allograft bone tissue will continue to be based primarily upon the use of such products by physicians specializing in the orthopaedic  spine  neurological and oral maxillofacial surgical areas 
our future growth depends in part upon such physicians wider use of allograft bone tissue as an alternative to autograft bone tissue and other available materials and treatments 
we have tried to educate physicians through our marketing activities 
our future efforts in this regard may fail to generate additional demand for our allograft tissue forms 
governmental regulation could restrict the use of our products or our procurement of tissue 
in the united states  the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to federal law pursuant to nota  a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation  including bone and related tissue  for valuable consideration 
nota permits reasonable payments associated with the removal  transportation  processing  preservation  quality control  implantation and storage of human bone tissue 
we provide services in all of these areas  with the exception of removal and implantation and receive payments for all such services 
we make payments to certain of our clients  tro s and tissue banks for their services related to recovering allograft bone tissue on our behalf 
if nota is interpreted or enforced in a manner which prevents us from receiving payment for services we render or which prevents us from paying tro s or certain of our clients for the services they render for us  our business could be materially  adversely affected 
we are engaged through our direct sales and marketing employees and our independent sales representatives in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of processed allograft bone tissue and in particular our allograft bone tissue forms  and we intend to continue our educational activities 
although we believe that nota permits payments in connection with these educational efforts as reasonable payments associated with the processing  transportation and implantation of our allograft bone tissue forms  payments in connections with such education efforts are not exempt from nota s restrictions and our inability to make such payments in connection with our education efforts may prevent us from paying our sales representatives for their education efforts and could adversely affect our business and prospects 
no federal agency or court has determined whether nota is  or will be  applicable to every allograft bone tissue based material  which our processing technologies may generate 
assuming that nota applies to our processing of allograft bone tissue  we believe that we comply with nota  but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of  or amendments to  nota will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations 
the us federal health care laws apply to certain aspects of our business if a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under medicare  medicaid or most other federally funded health care programs 
of principal importance to us  federal law prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded health care programs the anti kickback law  such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by medicare or medicaid 
the anti kickback law is subject to evolving interpretations 
if a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  osteotech  its officers and employee  could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including  for example  exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by medicare or medicaid 
our products are extensively regulated by federal and certain state agencies in the united states 
failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions  such as the fda s refusal to clear pending applications  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  civil penalties  injunctions and or criminal prosecution 
in the united states  the allograft bone tissues that we process are regulated by the fda as human tissue based products under section of the public health service act  and under certain circumstances  may be regulated as a medical device under the food  drug  and cosmetic act 
fda regulations generally do not require that human tissue based products be cleared or approved before they are marketed 
we are  however  required to register and list these products with the fda and to comply with regulations concerning tissue donor screening and testing  and related procedures and record keeping 
the fda periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements 
effective in may  the fda s good tissue practice regulations will go into effect  which would impose requirements on the manufacture of human tissue based products  including tissue recovery  donor screening  donors testing  processing  storage  labeling  packaging and distribution 
we believe we will comply with all aspects of the good tissue practice regulations  although there can be no assurance that we will comply or will comply in a timely manner 
allograft bone tissue and tissue banking activities  such as tissue donation and recovery and tissue processing  are regulated in virtually all countries in which we operate outside the united states 
the regulatory schemes and specific requirements for these products and activities vary from country to country 
there are no common or harmonized regulatory approvals or programs for these products and activities  such as there are for medical devices marketed in the european union 
we believe that we comply with the national regulations in the countries in which we currently operate or in the countries we plan to operate in the future  although there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so in the future 
the fda has changed the regulatory status of our grafton dbm products and the consequences of that decision are uncertain 
in march   the fda informed us that the agency is changing the regulatory status of grafton dbm  and in its october  letter  the fda indicated that its determination regarding grafton dbm is also to be applied to grafton plus db  and will henceforth regulate all grafton dbm tissue forms as a medical device 
medical device regulation is a more stringent category of regulation and  in particular  medical devices require fda clearance or approval 
we believe the fda s change in its position regarding grafton dbm results from its decision to regulate all demineralized bone with a carrier  including those processed and marketed by some of our competitors  as medical devices 
in  we communicated to the fda that we will file a k submission for our grafton dbm line of tissue forms and  as appropriate  for the private label dbm tissue forms we process 
we filed three k submissions in late for our grafton and private label paste tissue forms and anticipate filing additional k submissions by the end of the second quarter of for our remaining grafton and private label dbm tissue forms 
we believe that all of our grafton and private label dbm tissue forms will be eligible for k clearance  but we cannot be sure that we will not be required to obtain premarket approval  or that the fda will issue any clearance or approval in a timely fashion  or at all 
we cannot be sure that the fda will clear or approve our submission or will clear or approve any or all claims that we currently make for grafton dbm 
failure to obtain fda clearance or approval of grafton dbm  or any limitation on grafton dbm claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
loss of key persons could limit our success 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and scientific and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the loss of services of our key personnel  particularly members of senior management  could adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to enforce our patents or if it is determined that we infringe patents held by others it could damage our business 
we consider our allograft bone tissue processing technology and procedures proprietary and rely primarily on patents to protect our technology and innovations 
consultants employed by third parties and persons working in conjunction with medical institutions unaffiliated with us have conducted significant research and development for our products 
accordingly  disputes may arise concerning the proprietary rights to information applied to our projects  which have been independently developed  by such consultants or medical institutions 
in addition  you should recognize that although we have attempted to protect our technology with patents  our existing patents may prove invalid or unenforceable as to products or services marketed by our competitors 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  our existing or future products and technologies could be found to infringe the patents of others 
prosecuting and defending patent lawsuits is very expensive 
we are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property  which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop 
in addition  the industry in which we compete is known for having a great deal of litigation involving patents 
these factors could cause us to become involved in new patent litigation in the future 
the expense of prosecuting or defending these future lawsuits could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we were to lose a patent lawsuit in which another party is asserting that our products infringe its patents  we would likely be prohibited from marketing those products and could also be liable for significant damages 
either or both of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose a patent lawsuit in which we are claiming that another party s products are infringing our patents and thus  are unable to enforce our patents  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products face competitive threats from alternate technologies 
the primary advantage of synthetic bone substitutes and growth factors as compared to allograft bone tissue is that they do not depend on the availability of donated human tissue 
in addition  members of the medical community and the general public may perceive synthetic materials and growth factors as safer than allograft based bone tissue 
the allograft bone tissue we process may be incapable of competing successfully with synthetic bone substitutes and growth factors which are developed and commercialized by others  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
companies are also developing artificial disks  which would be used to replace a patient s own injured  degenerated or diseased spinal disks 
if these disks are successfully developed and commercialized  they could have a negative impact on our bio implant business and  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur losses from product liability lawsuits 
the testing and use of human allograft bone tissue  bovine tissue products and medical devices manufactured by others and which we distribute  entail inherent risks of medical complications for patients and therefore may result in product liability claims against us 
further  our agreements with our allograft bone tissue processing clients provide for indemnification by us for liabilities arising out of defects in allograft bone tissue they distribute  which is caused by our processing 
we presently maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and per year in the aggregate 
we may be unable to maintain such insurance in the future and such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all claims made against us or all types of liabilities  which may be asserted against us 
we may face lawsuits or governmental enforcement activities based on hazardous waste we generate in our operations 
our allograft bone tissue processing in both the united states and europe generates waste materials  which  in the united states  are classified as medical waste and or hazardous waste under regulations promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency and the new jersey department of environmental protection 
we segregate our waste materials and dispose of them through a licensed hazardous waste transporter in compliance with applicable regulations in both the united states and europe 
our failure to fully comply with any environmental regulations could result in the imposition of penalties  sanctions or  in some cases  private lawsuits  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on our independent sales agents and sales representatives to educate surgeons concerning our products and to market our products 
our success depends largely upon arrangements we have with independent sales agents and sales representatives whereby they educate surgeons concerning our products 
these independent sales agents and sales representatives may terminate their relationship with us  or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
we do not control our independent sales agents and they may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans 
our failure to attract and retain skilled independent sales agents and sale representatives could have an adverse effect on our operations 
the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of common stockholders or discourage a takeover 
under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in january   our board of directors authorized shares of series e preferred stock in connection with its adoption of a stockholder rights plan  under which we issued rights to purchase series e preferred stock to holders of our common stock 
upon certain triggering events  such rights become exercisable to purchase common stock or  in the discretion of our board of directors  series e preferred stock at a price substantially discounted from the then current market price of the common stock 
our stockholder rights plan could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving our securities that is not approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer 
while we have no present intention to authorize any additional series of preferred stock  such issuance  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to the common stock  and  as a result  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the united states  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and interest expense on short term and long term debt 
we do not enter into derivative transactions related to our cash  cash equivalents or debt 
accordingly  we are subject to changes in interest rates 
based on our december  cash and cash equivalents and long term debt  a change in interest rates would have a negligible impact on our results of operations 
the value of the us dollar affects our financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and net income 
we do not maintain hedging programs to mitigate the potential exposures of exchange rate risk 
accordingly  our results of operations are adversely affected by the strengthening of the us dollar against currencies  primarily the euro  in which we sell products and services or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs 
based on the operating results of our foreign operations for the year ended december   a change in the exchange rates would impact our net income loss by less than  because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance
