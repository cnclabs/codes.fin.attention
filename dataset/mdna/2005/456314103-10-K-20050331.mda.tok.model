item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under item  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
we have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation with no effect on previously reported net income loss or shareholders equity 
the following discussion and analysis contains certain financial predictions  forecasts and projections which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
actual results could differ materially from those financial predictions  forecasts and projections and there can be no assurance that we will achieve such financial predictions  forecasts and projections 
factors that could affect financial predictions  forecasts and projections include the fluctuations in the commodity price index and any conditions internal to our major customers  including loss of their accounts 
general we continue to pursue a growth strategy in the waste management services arena servicing over  customer locations throughout the united states  canada  and puerto rico and building a base of approximately  service providers 
this strategy will allow for diversity of business opportunities so that we are not as dependent upon the operating results of the recycling division 
this diversity has helped to stabilize revenues and gross profit during a period of time when commodity prices fluctuate and affect the ferrous and non ferrous markets 
much of our focus and attention now and in the future is directed towards the growth of the management services business segment through expansion in the existing markets and through an acquisition strategy 
we are also focused upon technology enhancements that we can provide to the new and existing customer base to further solidify customer relationships 
additionally  we are exploring strat egic alliances and relationships that will enable us to effectively execute our growth and acquisition strategy 
we have operating locations in louisville  kentucky  and seymour  indiana 
we do not have operating locations outside the united states but we service over  customer locations throughout the united states  canada  mexico and puerto rico  building a base of approximately  service providers 
revenue derived from customers located outside the united states was  for the year ended december  cost of goods sold derived from customers located outside the united states was  gross profit before selling  general and administrative expenses was  we do not separate selling  general and administrative expenses between customers located in the united states or outside the united states 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we held cash and cash equivalents of we currently maintain a million senior revolving credit facility with the branch banking and trust company 
it replaced a million senior revolving credit facility that expired january  indebtedness under this credit facility accrues interest at the bb t s prime rate 
the maturity date under this agreement is january we have collaterized the credit facility with all our assets 
as of december  and december   there were no borrowings against the credit facility 
the terms of the credit facility place certain restrictive covenants on us  including maintenance of a specified tangible net worth  debt to net worth and ebitda ratio 
consequently  these covenants restrict our ability to incur as much additional debt as we may desire for future growth 
at december   we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants and the entire amount of our credit facility was available for borr owings at december  during  we committed approximately  for purchases of property and equipment 
in the recycling segment we committed approximately  for the purchase of an alloy analyzer  a forklift  crane magnets and several open top containers 
in the equipment sales  leasing and service segment  we capitalized approximately  as rental equipment that we located at customer sites 
building and land improvements were  capitalized computer hardware and software was  we purchased these fixed asset additions with existing cash flows 
the significant decrease in property and equipment purchases in was primarily due to no real estate purchases in compared to  in in the year  we purchased acres and a building at grade lane  louisville  kentucky for  we intend to purchase real estate properties when the opportunities present themselves  but it is not a primary part of our business 
the decrease in real estate purchases was partially offset by rental fleet equipment purchases  which were  greater for the first nine months of as compared to the same period in this rental fleet equipment consists of solid waste handling and recycling equipment such as compactors  containers and balers 
it is our intention to continue to pursue this market 
we implemented the use of a purchasing card with a credit limit of million in the second quarter of we have included the balance due on the purchasing card as part of accounts payable 
the outstanding balance on the purchasing card at december  was  with a due date of january  the card accrues interest at prime plus after the first twenty five days of the purchase  our intention is to pay off the full balance every month so as to not incur finance charges 
to date we have not incurred any interest charges on this purchasing card 
the card requires monthly minimum payments on any balance outstanding at month end 
we receive rebates on an annual basis for all purchases made with the card 
we expect that existing cash flow from operations and available credit under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our cash needs in critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe that we consistently apply judgments and estimates and that such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our statement of operations and financial conditions 
critical accounting policies  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subj ective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from processed ferrous and non ferrous scrap metal sales when title passes to the customer 
we recognize revenues from services as the service is performed 
we accrue sales adjustments related to price and weight differences and allowances for uncollectible receivables against revenues as incurred 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers from product and brokered sales 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
our determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable includes a number of factors  including the age of the balance  past experience with the customer account  changes in collection patterns and general industry conditions 
potential credit losses from our significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
general weakness in the steel and metals sectors during the period from to previously led to bankruptcy filings by many of our customers  which caused us to recognize additional allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  changes in economic conditions or any weakness in the steel and metals industries could adversely impact our future earnings 
inventory our inventories primarily consist of ferrous and non ferrous scrap metals and we value at the lower of average purchased cost or market 
we determine quantities of inventories based on our inventory systems  which are subject to periodic physical verification using estimation techniques including observation  weighing and other industry methods 
prices of commodities we own may be volatile 
we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous and non ferrous metals  which are at times volatile 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to rapidly turn our inventories 
property and equipment we carry the value of land on our books at cost 
we report premises and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we charge depreciation and amortization for financial reporting purposes to operating expense using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
estimated useful lives are up to years for buildings and leasehold improvements  to years for office and operating equipment  and years for rental equipment 
our determination of estimated useful life includes past experience and normal deterioration 
we include maintenance and repairs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we include gains and losses on disposition of premises and equipment in gain loss on sale of assets 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable 
if an evaluation is required  we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary 
the effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value 
during the year ended december   we determined no impairment existed 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that we review goodwill at least annually for impairment based on the fair value method 
at december   we determined  based on current industry and other market information  that no impairment existed 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date

consulting expenses increased  in we had downsized our it department in prior years  so we outsourced some it work to consultants 
additionally  we upgraded our sales team internally and used outside consultants to train them 
we will continue to use consultants in our business as we see the need 
labor increased  primarily due to increases in clerical personnel 
equipment repairs and mainten ance increases were directly related to the rental fleet  which is aging  resulting in increased repairs and maintenance 
property lease expense decreased primarily because of a one time payment of  for terminating a property lease agreement in the recycling division 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in compared to in interest expense decreased  or to  in compared to  in due to payoff of debt during other income was  in compared to other expense of  in this increase of  is primarily due to a  expense for consulting expenses not related to any operating activities and income of  due to canadian exchange rates

the effective rate in was approximately based primarily on the federal and state statutory rates offset partially by the benefit of reducing the deferred tax valuation allowance established the preceding year

the decrease in real estate purchases was partially offset by an increase in rental fleet equipment purchases of  we made rental fleet equipment purchases of  in as compared to  for the same period in this rental fleet equipment consists of solid waste handling and recycling equipment such as compactors  containers and balers 
it is our intention to continue to pursue this market

this strong cash flow from the exercise of common stock options will not continue in the future based on only  options remaining outstanding  all with an exercise price of as of december  we do not plan to grant new stock options in the future 
on january   we replaced our previous million senior revolving credit facility with a new million senior revolving credit facility that expires in january at december   we did not have any short term borrowings outstanding 
the credit facility requires us to comply with certain debt covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  we implemented the use of a purchasing card with a credit limit of million in the second quarter of we include the balance due on the purchasing card as part of accounts payable 
the outstanding balance on the purchasing card at december  was  we believe our principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand  cash generated from operations and the availability of borrowing under our senior revolving credit facility and purchasing card will be sufficient to fund operations in fiscal year our primary source of funds is our ability to generate cash from operations to meet our liquidity obligations  which could be affected by factors such as a decline in demand for our products  loss of key contract customers  our ability to generate profits and other unforeseen circumstances 
our secondary source of funds is our revolving credit facility  which is contingent on complying with certain debt covenants 
we do not expect the covenants to limit or restrict our ability to borrow on the facility in fiscal year we anticipate maintaining a strong liquidity position for the fiscal year 
trade accounts receivable after allowances for doubtful accounts decreased  or to  as of december  aggressive collection methods have had a direct impact on decreasing trade accounts receivable after allowances for doubtful accounts  even though revenue increased  or for the fourth quarter of and  or for the year of the revenue increase is due to an increase in revenues per the customer locations while maintaining a consistent customer base in the management services segment as well as an increase in the volume of shipments and sale prices in the recycling segment

impact of recently issued accounting standards sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  will apply to awards we grant or modify after july  we will also record compensation cost as required for prior option grants that vest after that date 
the effect of adopting sfas r revised on our consolidated results of operations will depend on the level of future option grants and the fair value of the options granted at such future dates  as well as the vesting periods provided by such awards and  therefore  cannot currently be estimated 
existing outstanding options will not result in additional compensation expense during the second half of fiscal upon adoption of sfas r since all outstanding options are fully vested 
there will be no significant effect on our consolidated financial position since total stockholders equity will not be impacted 
sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  will require that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  statement will require that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  our adoption of statement will have no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fluctuating commodity prices affect market risk in our recycling segment 
we mitigate this risk by selling our product on a monthly contract basis 
each month we negotiate selling prices for all commodities 
based on these monthly agreements  we determine purchase prices based on a margin needed to cover processing and administrative expenses 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate borrowings 
as of december   variable rate borrowings consisted of outstanding borrowings of million under our credit agreement 
borrowings on our credit agreement bear interest at the prime rate 
any increase in prime rate would lead to higher interest expense 
we do not have any interest rate swaps or caps in place  which would mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate on this indebtedness 
based on our average anticipated borrowings under our credit agreement in fiscal  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the prime rate by would increase or decrease interest expense on our variable borrowings by approximately  per year  with a corresponding change in cash flows
