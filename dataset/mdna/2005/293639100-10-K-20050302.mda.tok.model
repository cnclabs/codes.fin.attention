our corporate history our chairman of the board  joseph m 
field  founded entercom in throughout our more than year history  we have experienced sustained growth by adapting our acquisition and operating strategies to capitalize on changes occurring in the radio broadcasting industry 
in connection with our initial public offering on january   our company s class a common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange on january  our founder  joseph m 
field  continues to be a major shareholder of our company 
an overview our radio strategy centers on providing programming that is relevant to our communities 
the primary source of revenues for our radio stations is the sale of advertising time to local  regional and national spot advertisers and national network advertisers 
a station s local sales staff generates the majority of its local and regional advertising sales through direct solicitations of local advertising agencies and businesses 
we retain a national representative firm on an exclusive basis to sell national spot commercial airtime on our stations to advertisers outside of our local markets 
national spot radio advertising typically accounts for approximately of a radio station s revenues 
radio is considered an efficient and effective means of reaching specifically identified demographic groups 
our stations are typically classified by their format  such as news  talk  classic rock  adult contemporary  alternative  oldies and jazz  among others 
a station s format enables it to target specific segments of listeners sharing certain demographic features 
by capturing a specific share of a market s radio listening audience  with particular concentration in a targeted demographic  a station is able to market its broadcasting time to advertisers seeking to reach a specific audience 
advertisers and stations use data published by audience measuring services  such as the arbitron ratings company  to estimate how many people within particular geographical markets and demographics listen to specific stations 
our geographically diverse portfolio of radio stations and radio station formats  allows us to deliver targeted messages for specific audiences to advertisers on a local  regional  and national basis 
we believe owning multiple radio stations in a market allows us to provide our listeners with a more diverse programming selection and a more efficient means for our advertisers to reach those listeners 
by owning multiple stations in a market  we are also able to operate our stations with more highly skilled local management teams and maximize operating efficiencies 
our acquisition strategy through our disciplined acquisition strategy  we seek to build leading station clusters more than one radio station in any given market principally in large growth markets and acquire underdeveloped properties that offer the potential for significant improvements in revenues and broadcast cash flow through the application of our operational expertise 
our operating strategy the principal components of our operating strategy are to develop market leading station clusters 
recruit  develop  motivate and retain superior employees 
build strongly branded franchises 
leverage station clusters to capture greater share of advertising revenue 
acquire and develop under performing stations 
competition  changes in broadcasting industry the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive as we compete with all advertising media including television  newspaper  outdoor advertising  direct mail  cable  yellow pages  internet  satellite radio and other forms of advertisement 
in addition  our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenue directly with other radio stations within their respective markets 
the success of each of our stations depends largely upon its audience ratings and its share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group 
by building a strong listener base consisting of a specific demographic group in each of our markets  we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners 
the following are some of the factors which are important to a radio station s competitive position management talent and expertise  audience ratings  sales talent and expertise  audience characteristics  signal strength  and the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area 
we attempt to improve our competitive position with promotional campaigns aimed at the demographic groups targeted by our stations and by sales efforts designed to attract advertisers 
radio station operators are subject to the possibility of another station changing programming formats to compete directly for listeners and advertisers or launching an aggressive promotional campaign in support of an already existing competitive format 
if a competitor were to attempt to compete in either of these fashions  the financial results of our affected station could decrease due to increased promotional and other expenses and or lower advertising revenues 
there can be no assurance that any one of our radio stations will be able to maintain or increase its current audience ratings and radio advertising revenue market share 
the operation of a radio broadcast station requires a license from the federal communications commission or fcc 
the number of radio stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the number of am and fm frequencies allotted by the fcc to communities in that market 
the fcc s multiple ownership rules further limit the number of stations serving the same area which may be owned or controlled by a single entity 
on june   the fcc adopted new ownership rules which define the local radio market by reference  where available  to the geographic markets established by arbitron  for stations located outside of arbitron markets  the former contour overlap definition with some modifications is being used on an interim basis pending completion of a rule making proceeding to determine permanent procedures for such stations 
various pro regulatory and deregulatory parties appealed the fcc decision to the us court of appeals for the third circuit  which stayed the effective date for the new rules 
in june  the court affirmed the fcc s decision to use arbitron markets but remanded the case to the fcc for further consideration of the numerical limits imposed on the number of stations a single party could own in such markets 
the court left the stay in place 
on september   the court granted the fcc s request for a partial lifting of the stay of the new radio ownership rules and allowed four aspects of the new rules to take effect the use of arbitron markets to define local radio markets where available  the inclusion of non commercial radio stations in determining the number of stations in the market  the attribution of joint sales agreements with in market stations  and the limitations on the transfers of non compliant ownership clusters 
the fcc has selected in band on channel  or iboc  as the exclusive technology for introduction of terrestrial digital operations by am and fm radio stations 
the fcc has authorized the commencement of hybrid iboc transmissions  that is  simultaneous broadcast in both digital and analog format  after receipt of individual grant of special temporary authority by the fcc pending the adoption of formal licensing and service rules 
the advantages of digital audio broadcasting over traditional analog broadcasting technology include improved sound quality and the ability to offer a greater variety of auxiliary services 
iboc technology permits a station to transmit radio programming in both analog and digital formats  and eventually in digital only formats  using the bandwidth that the radio station is currently licensed to use 
it is unclear what impact the introduction of digital broadcasting will have on the radio market in which we compete 
the fcc also has a pending proceeding which contemplates the use of digital technology by existing am and fm radio broadcast stations to both improve sound quality and provide spectrum for enhanced data services to complement the existing programming service and provide new business opportunities for radio broadcasters 
under special temporary authority  the fcc has authorized use of iboc digital technology developed by ibiquity digital corporation  or ibiquity  on fm stations full time and on am stations day time only 
the final digital radio rules remain under consideration by the fcc 
we currently utilize iboc digital technology on a number of our stations and plan to install iboc digital technology on most of our other stations over the next few years 
this digital technology offers the possibility of multiple audio channels in our assigned frequency 
in addition to committing to the use of this technology  we have also purchased an equity interest in ibiquity 
our stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media such as newspapers  magazines  over the air and cable television  outdoor advertising and direct mail 
the radio broadcasting industry also competes with new media technologies which are being developed or introduced  such as satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which now has two primarily subscriber based services that offer numerous formats with cd type sound quality  audio programming offered by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers  personal communications services and other wireless digital audio delivery services  and low power fm radio  which has resulted in new noncommercial fm stations serving small  localized areas 
the radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information  such as television broadcasting  cable television  audio tapes  personal digital audio devises and compact discs 
there can be no assurances  however  that this historical growth will continue or that the development or introduction in the future of any new media technology will not have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry 
we cannot predict what other new competitive services or other regulatory matters might be considered in the future by the fcc  nor can we assess in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any of these services  proposals or changes  including the radio industry s introduction of digital audio broadcasting  might have on our business 
federal regulation of radio broadcasting the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation of  among other things  ownership limitations  program content  advertising content  technical operations and business and employment practices 
the ownership  operation and sale of radio stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc 
among other things  the fcc assigns frequency bands for broadcasting  determines the particular frequencies  locations  operating power  and other technical parameters of stations  issues  renews  revokes and modifies station licenses  determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses  regulates equipment used by radio stations  and adopts and implements regulations and policies which directly affect the ownership  operation and employment practices of stations 
the fcc has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the communications act of the communications act  including the imposition of monetary fines  the issuance of short term licenses  the imposition of a condition on the renewal of a license  the denial of authority to acquire new stations  and the revocation of operating authority 
the maximum fines for a single violation of the fcc s rules is currently  proposals to increase the fines  that may be imposed for the broadcast of indecent programming  were introduced before congress in but were not adopted  it is possible that similar proposals may be introduced in the following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act and of certain specific fcc regulations and policies 
this summary is not a comprehensive listing of all of the regulations and policies affecting radio stations 
for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations  you should refer to the communications act  fcc rules and fcc public notices and rulings 
fcc licenses 
radio stations operate pursuant to renewable broadcasting licenses that are ordinarily granted by the fcc for maximum terms of eight years 
the fcc licenses for our stations are held by our subsidiaries 
a station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending 
during the periods when renewal applications are pending  petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties  including members of the public  on a variety of grounds 
the fcc is required to renew a broadcast station license if the fcc finds that the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or the fcc s rules and regulations  and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the communications act or the fcc s rules and regulations that  taken together  constitute a pattern of abuse 
if a challenge is filed against a renewal application  and  as a result of an evidentiary hearing  the fcc determines that the licensee has failed to meet certain requirements and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction  the fcc may deny a license renewal application 
historically  fcc licenses have generally been renewed 
we have no reason to believe that our licenses will not be renewed in the ordinary course  although there can be no assurance to that effect 
the non renewal of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the fcc classifies each am and fm station 
am stations are classified as class a  b  c or d depending on the type of channel and area they are designed to serve 
class a stations operate on an unlimited time basis and are designed to render primary and secondary service over an extended area 
class b stations operate on an unlimited time basis and are designed to render service only over a primary service area 
class c stations operate on a local channel and are designed to render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference 
class d stations operate either during daytime hours only  during limited times only or on an unlimited time basis with low nighttime power 
the class of an fm station determines the minimum and maximum facilities requirements 
some fm class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter site of the fm station is located 
in general  commercial fm stations are classified as follows  in order of increasing maximum power and antenna height class a  b  c  b  c  c  c and c 
class c fm stations that do not meet certain minimum antenna height parameters are subject to an involuntary downgrade in class to class c under certain circumstances  so that their class reflects the existing operating characteristics of the station

pursuant to fcc rules and regulations  many am radio stations are licensed to operate at a reduced power during the nighttime broadcasting hours  which can result in reducing the radio station s coverage during the nighttime hours of operation 
both daytime and nighttime power ratings are shown  where applicable 
for fm stations  the maximum effective radiated power in the main lobe is given 
wvei am is licensed to the adjacent community of worcester  massachusetts and simulcasts weei am programming 
kslm am is licensed to salem  oregon  within the portland market and simulcasts kfxx am programming 
the fcc rules require that by the end of a five year transition period  which expires in october  we must elect to operate on either the khz frequency or the khz frequency and surrender the other frequency to the fcc 
as of february   application for license renewal pending with the fcc 
pursuant to an asset purchase agreement and a time brokerage agreement  the sale of these stations is expected to occur during the first quarter of transfers or assignment of licenses 
the communications act prohibits the assignment of broadcast licenses or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the fcc 
in determining whether to grant such approval  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the existing licensee and the proposed licensee  including compliance with the various rules limiting common ownership of media properties in a given market  the character of the proposed licensee  and compliance with the communications act s limitations on alien ownership as well as compliance with other fcc regulations and policies 
to obtain fcc consent to assign or transfer control of a broadcast license  appropriate applications must be filed with the fcc 
interested parties may file objections or petitions to deny such applications 
when passing on an assignment or transfer application  the fcc is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by assignment or transfer of the broadcast license to any party other than the one specified in the application 
no assignment or transfer application will be granted for any station by the fcc while a renewal application is pending for the station 
once an assignment or transfer application is granted  interested parties have days following public notice of the grant to seek reconsideration of that grant 
the fcc usually has an additional ten days to set aside the grant on its own motion 
the communications act permits certain court appeals of a contested grant as well 
multiple ownership rules 
the communications act imposes specific limits on the number of commercial radio stations an entity can own in a single market  and fcc rules and regulations  in effect since  have implemented these limitations 
on june   the fcc adopted new ownership rules following a comprehensive review of its ownership regulations 
these new ownership rules include i including new cross media limits that in certain markets eliminated the newspaper broadcast cross ownership ban  and ii the television radio cross ownership ban  and regulations that revised the manner in which the radio numeric ownership limitations were to be applied  substituting where available geographic markets as determined by arbitron in place of the former standard which was based on certain overlapping signal contours 
as earlier discussed  however  the new radio ownership rules have gone into effect  but remain subject to administrative and judicial review  as well as to possible legislation to be considered in congress 
the fcc s newspaper broadcast cross ownership rules prevent the same party from owning a broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same geographic market  and the radio television cross ownership rules limits the number of radio stations that a local owner of television stations may hold 
we own no television stations or daily newspapers  but  to the extent these limitations are not ultimately eliminated  the continued existence of any cross media rules may limit the prospective buyers in the market of any stations we may wish to sell 
the ownership rules also effectively prevent us from selling stations in a market to a buyer that has reached its ownership limit in the market 
under the local radio ownership rule  as currently enforced  the number of radio stations that can be owned by a single entity in a local radio market are as follows in markets with or more commercial and non commercial radio stations  ownership is limited to eight commercial stations  no more than five of which can be in the same service that is  all of which are am or fm  in markets with to commercial and non commercial radio stations  ownership is limited to seven commercial stations  no more than four of which can be in the same service  in markets with to commercial and non commercial radio stations  ownership is limited to six commercial stations  no more than four of which can be in the same service  and in markets with or fewer commercial and non commercial radio stations  ownership is limited to five commercial stations or no more than of stations in the market  whichever is lower  and no more than three of which can be in the same service 
the rules as now enforced  define a local radio market as all radio stations  both commercial and non commercial  which are in the arbitron market  where available  or which have certain overlapping signal contours under procedures adopted by the fcc for stations located outside of arbitron markets  these procedures  including non commercial stations  the adoption of the geographic arbitron market analysis  and the application of numerical limits to local radio ownership  were affirmed by the court of appeals 
however  the court of appeals has remanded to the fcc for further justification the specific numerical limitations selected by the fcc 
in the interim  these limitations are being applied  since they are the same as the limitations under the former rules 
under the new rules  the company s market clusters in kansas city and wilkes barre scranton exceed the ownership limits 
these rules provide that clusters that exceed the new ownership limits but complied with the limitations under the former rules are grandfathered 
non compliant clusters  however  cannot in the future be transferred intact to a single party unless the cluster qualifies under specified standards as a small business 
several parties have petitioned the us supreme court for certiorari 
the local radio ownership rules are therefore subject to further modification  either by order of supreme court or by the fcc in remand from the court of appeals 
in addition  a number of parties have urged congress to undertake a comprehensive review of the communications act  including its ownership provisions  and proposals may be introduced in congress which could result in still different ownership rules affecting  among other matters  the number of stations that may be owned in a common geographic area and whether existing combinations would be considered as grandfathered 
alien ownership rules 
the communications act prohibits the issuance to or holding of broadcast licenses by foreign governments or aliens  non us citizens  whether individuals or entities  including any interest in a corporation which holds a broadcast license if more than of the capital stock is owned or voted by aliens 
in addition  the fcc may prohibit any corporation from holding a broadcast license if the corporation is directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens if the fcc finds that the prohibition is in the public interest 
our articles of incorporation prohibit the ownership  voting and transfer of our capital stock in violation of the fcc restrictions  and prohibit the issuance of capital stock or the voting rights such capital stock represents to or for the account of aliens or corporations otherwise subject to control by aliens in excess of the fcc limits 
programming and operation 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
a licensee is required to present programming that is responsive to issues in the station s community of license and to maintain records demonstrating this responsiveness 
the fcc will often consider complaints from listeners concerning a station s programming when it evaluates renewal applications of a licensee  but the fcc may consider complaints at anytime 
the fcc regulates  among other things  political advertising  sponsorship identifications  the advertisement of contests and lotteries  obscene  indecent and profane broadcasts  and those that impose technical operation requirements  including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation 
recently  the fcc has received an increasing number of complaints alleging that broadcast stations have carried indecent programming at times when children may be in the audience  in violation of federal criminal law and the fcc s policies  which prohibit programming that is deemed to be indecent or profane under fcc decisions  and is carried during the hours of am until pm 
when children may be in the audience 
the fcc has greatly intensified its enforcement activities with respect to such material as follows by increasing to  per occurrence  the maximum monetary fines for such proven violations of fcc policies  by warning that fines will be assessed in the future on a per utterance basis instead of the imposition of a single fine for an entire program  and by repeatedly warning broadcasters that future serious violations may result in the commencement of license revocation proceedings 
in addition  proposals have been introduced in congress that could substantially increase the potential fines 
congressional hearings with regard to such programming matters have been held  and it is likely that these issues will be raised in congress again 
for further discussion  please refer to item  legal proceedings and to the risk factors described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
the fcc has rules prohibiting employment discrimination by broadcast stations on the basis of race  religion  color  national origin and gender 
these rules require broadcasters generally to refrain from discrimination in hiring and promotion  to widely disseminate information about all full time job openings to all segments of the community to ensure that all qualified applicants have sufficient opportunity to apply for the job  to send job vacancy announcements to recruitment organizations and others in the community indicating an interest in all or some vacancies at the station  and to implement a number of specific longer term recruitment outreach efforts  such as job fairs  internship programs  and interaction with educational and community groups from among a menu of approaches itemized by the fcc 
the applicability of these policies to part time employment opportunities is the subject of a pending further rule making proceeding 
proposed and recent changes 
congress and the fcc may in the future consider and adopt new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect  directly or indirectly  the operation  ownership and profitability of our radio stations  result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our radio stations  and affect our ability to acquire additional radio stations or to finance those acquisitions 
such matters may include imposition or increases in regulatory fees  spectrum use fees  or other fees on fcc licenses  foreign ownership of broadcast licenses  revisions to the fcc s rules relating to political broadcasting  including free air time to candidates  adoption of new technical rules and frequency allocation matters  proposals to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenses by advertisers  proposals to regulate or prohibit payments to stations by independent record promoters  proposals to regulate further indecent or profane programming material  including an increase in the amount of the fines and regulatory consequences that may be imposed as a consequence of the broadcast of such programming  proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer  wine and other alcoholic beverages on radio  and changes in the fcc s ownership and attribution policies see multiple ownership rules 
the fcc has adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed for new or major change applications that are mutually exclusive 
such procedures may limit our efforts to build new stations  or to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our existing stations 
federal antitrust laws 
the agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws ie  the federal trade commission and the department of justice may investigate certain acquisitions 
for an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds  the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of requires the parties to file notification and report forms with the federal trade commission and the department of justice and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition 
any decision by the federal trade commission or the department of justice to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate the acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific department of justice or federal trade commission investigation 
employees as of february   we had a staff of  full time employees and part time employees 
we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with the american federation of television and radio artists aftra  which apply to some of our programming personnel

environmental as the owner  lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities  we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
historically  compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business 
there can be no assurance  however  that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures of funds 
seasonality seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the radio broadcasting industry and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures 
our revenues and broadcast cash flows are typically lowest in the first calendar quarter 
item properties the types of properties required to support each of our radio stations include offices  studios and transmitter antenna sites 
we typically lease our studio and office space  although we do own some of our facilities 
most of our studio and office space leases contain lease terms with expiration dates of five to fifteen years 
a station s studios are generally housed with its offices in downtown or business districts 
we generally consider our facilities to be suitable and of adequate size for our current and intended purposes 
we own many of our main transmitter and antenna sites and lease the remainder of our transmitter antenna sites with lease terms that expire  including renewal options  in periods generally ranging up to twenty years 
the transmitter antenna site for each station is generally located so as to provide maximum market coverage  consistent with the station s fcc license 
in general  we do not anticipate difficulties in renewing facility or transmitter antenna site leases or in leasing additional space or sites if required 
we have approximately million in aggregate minimum annual rental commitments under real estate leases 
the leases may contain escalation clauses such as defined contractual increases or cost of living adjustments 
our principal executive offices are located at city avenue  suite  bala cynwyd  pennsylvania  in  square feet of leased office space 
the lease on this premise expires october  we own substantially all of our other equipment  consisting principally of transmitting antennae  transmitters  studio equipment and general office equipment 
the towers  antennae and other transmission equipment used by our stations are generally in good condition  although opportunities to upgrade facilities are periodically reviewed 
item legal proceedings we currently and from time to time are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
we are not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which  in the opinion of management  is likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
the fcc has recently begun more vigorous enforcement  against the broadcasting industry as a whole  of its indecency rules concerning the broadcast of obscene  indecent  or profane material 
potential changes to enhance the fcc s authority in this area include the ability to impose substantially higher monetary forfeiture penalties  consider violations to be serious offenses in the context of license renewal applications  and  under certain circumstances  designate a license for hearing to determine whether such license should be revoked 
in the event that this or similar legislation is ultimately enacted into law  the company could face increased costs in the form of fines and a greater risk that the company could lose any one or more of the company s broadcasting licenses 
the fcc has issued notices of apparent liability or forfeiture orders with respect to several of our stations proposing fines for certain programming which the fcc deemed to have been indecent 
these cases have been or are being appealed

we operate in markets  including boston  seattle  denver  portland  sacramento  kansas city  indianapolis  milwaukee  new orleans  norfolk  buffalo  memphis  providence  greensboro  greenville spartanburg  rochester  madison  wichita  wilkes barre scranton and gainesville ocala 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on four factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by periodic reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of and demand for radio advertising time  both nationally and in the regions in which the station operates  and the market s size based upon available radio advertising revenue 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network compensation  radio station events and rental income from tower sites 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee compensation  and programming and promotional expenses 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
additionally  as opportunities arise  we may on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings and there are no guarantees that the modification or change to a station s format will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with any change to a station s format 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
we strive to develop strong listener loyalty as audience ratings in local markets are crucial to our stations financial success 
our results of operations include net revenues and station operating expenses from those net revenues and station operating expenses recognized under a time brokerage agreement or a similar sales agreement for stations operated by us prior to acquiring the stations 
depending on the facts and circumstances relating to each pending asset purchase agreement eg  whether or not there is an associated time brokerage agreement or similar agreement and the provisions of financial interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which would include any variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary  we may include the assets and liabilities of the entity holding the assets to be acquired  in our consolidated balance sheet  and the net revenues and station operating expenses of the entity holding the assets to be acquired  in our consolidated statement of operations 
more information on this interpretation by the financial accounting standards board is described in note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our results of operations represent the operations of the radio stations owned or operated pursuant to time brokerage agreements or joint sales agreements during the relevant periods 
we also discuss net revenues  station operating expenses and operating income by comparing the performance of stations owned or operated by us throughout a relevant year to the performance of those same stations in the prior year whether or not owned or operated by us 
included in the comparisons that follow are significant contracts that relate to station operations  have a significant effect on the net revenues and or station operating expenses of a particular market  and we account for as separate business units 
we also use these comparisons to assess the performance of our operations by analyzing the effect of acquisitions and dispositions of stations and changes in status of significant contracts on net revenues and station operating expenses throughout the periods measured 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year acquisitions on march   we acquired for million a radio station in denver that we began operating on february  under a time brokerage agreement  which in increased our depreciation and amortization expense and lowered net time brokerage fees and interest income  on may  we acquired for million  a radio station in sacramento  which in increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  and depreciation and amortization expense  on december   we acquired for million two radio stations in portland that we began operating june  under a time brokerage agreement  which in increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense and decreased our net time brokerage agreement fees  on may   we acquired for million a radio station in buffalo  new york which in increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense  on june   we acquired for million a radio station in providence  rhode island that we began operating on april   under a time brokerage agreement  which in increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  and interest expense  and on september   we acquired for million three radio stations in indianapolis  indiana that we began operating on june  under a time brokerage agreement  which in increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  net time brokerage agreement fees  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense 
dispositions in october our agreement for the rights to broadcast a major league sports team expired  which in reduced our net revenues and station operating expenses  on november   we disposed of a radio station in portland  oregon for million  which in reduced our net revenues  station operating expenses  interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense and gains on the sale of assets  on december   we recognized a gain on the sale of assets of million from the disposal of a parcel of land for million  which in resulted in a relative reduction compared to of our gains and losses on the sale of assets  on july   we entered into an agreement to dispose of a radio station in seattle  washington that the seller began operating on december  under a time brokerage agreement  which in and  affected our comparisons of net revenues and station operating expenses for stations owned and operated during these periods as we had not operated this station for the entire year  and on november   we entered into an agreement to dispose of four radio stations in longview  washington for million  that the seller began operating on november  under a time brokerage agreement  which in and  affected our comparisons of net revenues and station operating expenses for stations owned and operated during these periods as we had not operated these stations for the entire year 
financing derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with total notional amounts of million expired during  which in lowered interest expense as these derivatives had increased our effective interest rate on our senior debt  on april   subsequent to the conversion of million convertible preferred securities  term income deferrable equity securities tides into million shares of our class a common stock  we redeemed million of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures which in decreased our interest expense  on august   we entered into a new credit facility which in increased interest expense and resulted in the recognition of a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write off of deferred financing costs  and under authorized share repurchase programs  in we purchased million shares of class a common stock for an aggregate amount of million  which in increased our interest expense 
net revenues december  december  amounts in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change the increase in net revenues was primarily due to the effect of acquisitions during the current period and our sales and brand initiatives 
most of our markets realized an improvement in net revenues with our boston  denver  sacramento and norfolk markets contributing most to our overall net revenues increase 
indianapolis and providence  our two new markets in  also contributed to our overall net revenues increase 
the increase was offset by a decrease in net revenues in our kansas city market due to the expiration of a sports contract in and a decrease in net revenues in our new orleans market due to a general market decline in available advertising dollars for the media sector 
same station considerations net revenues for would have been lower by million if we had given effect to the impact on our results of operations of radio stations and significant contracts acquired or disposed of during the year as of january  net revenues for would have been lower by million if we had given effect to the impact on our results of operations of radio stations and significant contracts acquired or disposed of during the year  which were not owned or operated by us for the entire year of in and in  we generated and  respectively  of our net revenues from local advertising  and and  respectively  from national advertising 
station operating expenses december  december  amounts in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change the increase in station operating expenses in was primarily due to a correlating increase in the variable expenses associated with the increase in net revenues as described under net revenues 
same station considerations station operating expenses for would have been lower by million if we had given effect to the impact on our results of operations of radio stations and significant contracts acquired or disposed of during the year as of january  station operating expenses for would have been lower by million if we had given effect to the impact on our results of operations of radio stations and significant contracts acquired or disposed of during the year  which were not owned or operated by us for the entire year of depreciation and amortization expenses december  december  amounts in millions depreciation and amortization expenses amount of change percentage change the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was attributable to the acquisition of radio station assets in the denver  sacramento and portland markets during and in the buffalo  providence and indianapolis markets during corporate general and administrative expenses december  december  amounts in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses  which includes non cash compensation expense  was primarily due to the increased costs associated with changes in regulations applicable to public companies and the effects of inflation 
excluding non cash compensation expense  corporate general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  non cash compensation expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating income december  december  amounts in millions operating income amount of change percentage change the increase in operating income was due to the factors described above ie  changes in net revenues  offset by station operating expenses and a million decrease in net time brokerage agreement fees to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a shorter aggregate period during which we operated stations time brokerage agreements in as compared to the increase in operating income was partially offset by a loss on sale or disposal of assets of million for the year ended december  as compared to a gain of million for the year ended december   an increase in corporate general and administrative expenses of million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to the factors described above ie  changes in corporate general and administrative expense  and an increase in depreciation and amortization of million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to the factors described above ie  changes in depreciation and amortization expense 
same station considerations operating income for would have been higher by million exclusive of depreciation and amortization and net time brokerage agreement fees  where applicable if we had given effect to the impact on our results of operations of radio stations and significant contracts acquired or disposed of during the year as of january  operating income for would have been lower by million exclusive of depreciation and amortization and net time brokerage agreement fees  where applicable if we had given effect to the impact on our results of operations of radio stations and significant contracts acquired or disposed of during the year  which were not owned or operated by us for the entire year of interest expense december  december  amounts in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change interest expense included amortization of deferred financing costs  and in  the financing cost related to our tides 
the decrease in interest expense was attributable to the conversion to equity and the redemption for cash in april of million in tides 
the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in interest rates on outstanding debt and higher average outstanding debt used to finance the purchase of our stock in the amount of million under our stock repurchase programs  and radio station acquisitions costing million in december and million in income before income taxes and accounting change december  december  amounts in millions income before income taxes and accounting change amount of change percentage change the increase in income before income taxes and accounting change is mainly attributable to an improvement this year in net revenues  net of an increase in operating expenses  for the reasons described above  a reduction in loss on extinguishment of debt to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the redemption of our tides in and the termination of our bank facility in  a reduction in interest expense as a result of the factors described above under interest expense  and a decrease in net time brokerage agreement fees to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the reasons described above under operating income 
income taxes december  december  amounts in millions income taxes amount of change percentage change the increase in income taxes was a result of increased income before income taxes and accounting change 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was a result of a reduction in the benefits realized in connection with certain state tax planning strategies 
the current and deferred portions of our income tax expense were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  our deferred tax liability was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the deferred tax liability primarily relates to differences between book and tax bases of our fcc licenses 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas on january   we no longer amortize our fcc licenses  but instead test them for impairment annually 
as the tax basis in our fcc licenses continues to amortize  our deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect the significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse over time unless our fcc licenses become impaired  or our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction 
in  our expected annual effective tax rate  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  will be approximately 
our effective tax rate may be materially impacted by any or all of the following changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions  changes in the statues and rules applicable to taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  changes from the outcome of tax audits  and changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
net income december  december  amounts in millions net income amount of change percentage change the increase in net income was primarily attributable to the reasons described above under income before income taxes and accounting change  net of income tax expense

dispositions as of february   we terminated our joint sales agreement to sell advertising time broadcast on king fm in seattle  which in decreased our net revenues and station operating expenses  in october  our agreement for the rights to broadcast a professional baseball team expired  which in decreased our net revenues and station operating expenses  we did not incur any costs in in connection with an equity investment in an internet venture that ceased operations during which in resulted in an equity loss from an unconsolidated affiliate  on november   we disposed of a radio station in portland for million  which in decreased our net revenues  station operating expenses  interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense  and on december   we recognized a gain on the sale of assets of million from the disposal of a parcel of land for million  which in resulted in a relative increase compare to of our gains and losses on the sale of assets 
financing we received net proceeds of million from the march offering of our senior subordinated notes  which in increased our interest expense  we used a portion of the million in net proceeds from our march equity offering to reduce outstanding indebtedness of million under our bank facility s revolver  which in decreased our interest expense  we allowed derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with total notional amounts of million and million to expire during and  respectively  without entering into new derivatives  which in lowered interest expense as these derivatives had increased our effective interest rate on our senior debt  and on april   subsequent to the conversion of million tides into million shares of our class a common stock  we redeemed million of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures  which in decreased our interest expense 
net revenues december  december  amounts in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change increased net revenues in our denver  portland  boston and sacramento markets contributed most to our overall net revenue increases in  which more than compensated for a net revenue decrease in the seattle market 
the decrease in the seattle market was primarily as a result of the termination of the following significant contracts an agreement with the seattle mariners baseball club and a joint sales agreement to sell advertising time on king fm 
same station considerations net revenues for would have been lower by million if we had given effect to the impact on our results of operations of radio stations and significant contracts acquired or disposed of during the year as of january  net revenues for would have been lower by million if we had given effect to the impact on our results of operations of radio stations and significant contracts acquired or disposed of during the year  which were not owned or operated by us for the entire year ended december  in and in  we generated of our net revenues for each year from local advertising  and and  respectively  from net national spot advertising

the advertising contracts that impacted amortization expense during the years ended december  and were acquired in connection with the acquisition of radio station assets in the greensboro and denver markets 
corporate general and administrative expenses december  december  amounts in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in accounting fees primarily as a result of regulatory changes affecting public companies and the effects of inflation 
non cash compensation expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the recognition in of million in non cash compensation expense from the may  modification of option grants for then retiring members of our board of directors

the decrease in interest expense was mainly attributable to the expiration at various times during of derivatives with a total notional amount of million designated as cash flow hedges that effectively fixed the interest rate for our variable rate debt between and  the conversion to equity and the redemption for cash in april of the million in tides  offset by additional borrowings of million at a lower rate of interest under our bank facility used to finance the redemption  a reduction of million in our outstanding indebtedness as of march  from a portion of the cash proceeds from a public equity offering  the expiration this year of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge million notional amount that increased the effective interest rate on our variable rate debt to  and a reduction in interest rates from the prior year period 
the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by the increase in interest expense from the million senior subordinated notes issued on march  income before income taxes and accounting change december  december  amounts in millions income before income taxes and accounting change amount of change percentage change the increase in income before income taxes and accounting change is mainly attributable to a reduction in interest expense as a result of the factors described above under interest expense  a reduction during in net time brokerage agreement fees as a result of termination of time brokerage agreements upon completion of the acquisitions of our denver radio stations  partially offset by a new time brokerage agreement entered into in for two stations in the portland market  an improvement during in net revenues  net of an increase in operating expenses  for the reasons described above  the dissolution of an internet partnership  in which we had an equity investment  in the third quarter of that resulted in an equity loss from unconsolidated affiliate of million for the year ended december   and a net gain from derivative instruments of million for the year ended december  as opposed to a net loss from derivative instruments of million for the year ended december  income taxes december  december  amounts in millions income tax amount of change percentage change the increase in income taxes during is a result of increased income before income taxes and accounting change

the deferred tax liability primarily relates to differences between book and tax bases of our fcc licenses 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas on january   we ceased amortizing our fcc licenses  and began testing them for impairment annually 
as the tax basis in our fcc licenses continues to amortize  our deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect the significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse over time unless our fcc licenses become impaired  or our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction 
net income loss december  december  amounts in millions net income loss amount of change the increase in net income from a net loss is mainly attributable to a million impairment charge  net of a deferred tax benefit of million  under the cumulative effect of accounting change as an accumulated transition adjustment attributable to our adoption on january  of the statement of financial accounting standards no

liquidity and capital resources we have used a significant portion of our capital resources to reduce outstanding debt and to consummate radio station acquisitions 
in addition  as of december  we purchased million worth of our publicly held stock under share repurchase programs see liquidity and capital resources share repurchase programs below 
generally  our acquisitions  share repurchases  reductions of our outstanding debt and other capital requirements are funded from one or a combination of the following sources our credit agreement described below  the issuance and sale of securities  internally generated cash flow  and the swapping of our radio stations in transactions which qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code 
historically  we have not paid any dividends see part ii  item for a discussion of dividends 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases in our net cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily a result of increased advertising revenues that were only partially offset by increased station operating expenses which in each case  were affected by the acquisitions and dispositions of stations during those periods and increased income taxes 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million as compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a million increase in net income to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was offset primarily by a reduction in deferred taxes of million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the use in  and the absence in  of available net operating loss carry forwards

the net cash flows used in investing and financing activities for the year ended december  reflect acquisitions of radio station assets of million net of a decrease in station acquisition deposits and costs of million and a reduction in outstanding indebtedness of million

our new credit agreement or bank revolver on august  we entered into a new bank credit agreement  or bank revolver  with a syndicate of banks for a five year senior secured revolving credit facility of million 
we used proceeds of million from the bank revolver to pay all principal outstanding under our former credit facility 
the bank revolver provides us with an increase in liquidity

we also pay a commitment fee that varies depending on certain financial covenants and the amount of the unused commitment  to a maximum of per annum  on the average unused balance of the bank revolver 
management believes we are in compliance with all financial covenants and leverage ratios and all other terms of the agreement 
our senior subordinated notes also require us to comply with certain covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness and to make certain payments 
the covenants under the senior subordinated notes  in general  are less restrictive than the covenants under the bank revolver 
our liquidity has improved as a result of refinancing our senior indebtedness as we no longer fund principal payments that were required due to quarterly debt reduction commitments under our prior credit facility 
as of december   we had credit available of million under the bank revolver  subject to compliance with the covenants under the bank revolver at the time of borrowing 
our liquidity requirements are for working capital and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  and any one or more of the following repurchase of class a common stock  dividends and acquisitions 
in  we utilized the last of our accumulated federal and state corporate income tax net operating loss carry forwards  which helped to offset our cash requirements for taxes on our income 
in  due to the absence of any available net operating loss carry forwards  our cash requirements for payments of estimated taxes on our income were substantially higher than in in  we expect our cash requirements for payment of estimated taxes on our income to be similar to the cash requirements in during the year ended december   we paid million in income taxes that included certain state taxes for and estimated federal and certain state taxes for capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in and million in we anticipate that capital expenditures in will consist of an amount between million and million for capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business and for the conversion of many of our stations to digital radio  and an amount between million and million incurred for the relocation and consolidation of our studio facilities in several of our markets 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december  we increased our net outstanding debt by million  primarily due to the repurchase of shares in the amount of million and the purchase in several different markets of radio station assets in the amount of million 
as of december   we had outstanding million in senior debt  including million under our bank revolver  million in a letter of credit  and million in senior subordinated notes 
we may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing from time to time 
we believe that cash on hand and cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the bank revolver  should be sufficient to permit us to meet our financial obligations for the foreseeable future  including cash to fund our operations and any one or more of the following acquisitions  dividends and the repurchase of stock 
our bank revolver requires that at the time of closing on acquisitions  we must be in compliance with the terms of the bank revolver 
we believe that we will maintain compliance with the terms of our bank revolver 
if we are not in compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in amending or entering into a new credit agreement  obtaining additional financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us  which could delay or impair our efforts to consummate future acquisitions 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of the agreement could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding debt 
our ability to meet our financial obligations could be adversely impacted  however  by factors such as prolonged downturns in the economy  poor performance by our stations  increased competition from other media  and other factors that could be a result of world events 
in addition  we may require additional financing for future acquisitions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing at all or on terms considered favorable by us 
credit rating agencies on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s evaluate our debt 
as a result of their reviews  our credit rating could change 
management believes that any significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact on our future liquidity 
the effect of a change in our credit rating may limit or eliminate our ability to obtain debt financing  or include  among other things  interest rate changes under any future bank facilities  debentures  notes or other types of debt 
share repurchase programs on may  and on november   our board of directors authorized one year share repurchase programs of up to million for each program 
under these two repurchase programs  the following shares were purchased in and immediately retired million shares in the amount of million at an average price of per share  and million shares in the amount of million at an average price of per share 
during the period subsequent to december  and as of february   we purchased million shares at an average price of per share 
depending on market conditions and other factors  these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
as of february   million remained authorized as available for repurchase 
we expect to use cash available under our bank revolver and internally generated cash flow as a source of funds to repurchase shares under the remaining program 
our former credit agreement on august  we used the proceeds of million from the bank revolver to prepay all of the outstanding debt under our former credit facility or prior facility 
the prior facility  which was entered into on december  with a syndicate of banks  initially provided for senior secured credit of million that consisted of a million reducing revolving credit facility  and a million multi draw term loan 
the prior facility  which had a maturity date of september   reduced on a quarterly basis that began on september   in quarterly amounts that varied from million to million for each loan 
contractual obligations the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years amounts in thousands contractual obligations long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total a the maturity on our bank revolver  with outstanding debt in the amount of million as of december   could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of the agreement 
b under our million senior subordinated notes  the maturity could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants or could be repaid in cash by us at our option prior to the due date of the notes 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of the agreement 
a in connection with extensive litigation  on may   we acquired a radio station for a purchase price of million  which included an award by the court of million in damages as an offset against the original million purchase price 
a successful appeal by the seller could reverse the million in damages awarded by the court 
b we have certain liabilities of million related to i our obligation to provide a letter of credit  ii an obligation to increase our interest in a partnership carried as an investment  and iii construction obligations in connection with the relocation and consolidation of certain of our studio facilities 
c in addition to the above  purchase obligations of million primarily include contracts for on air personalities  sports programming rights  ratings services  music licensing fees  television advertising and equipment maintenance 
included in other long term liabilities of million are deferred income tax liabilities of million that are recognized for all temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
deferred tax liabilities may vary according to changes in tax laws  tax rates and the operating results of our company 
as a result  it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
therefore  deferred income tax liabilities have been reflected in more than years 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
an outstanding letter of credit of million as of december  was immaterial 
we enter into interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
in november  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with a buyer to dispose of the assets of four radio stations in longview  washington 
concurrently with entering into this asset purchase agreement  we entered into a time brokerage agreement 
the provisions of financial interpretation no 
r as revised  or fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 include any variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
in connection with this transaction  we determined that fin r was applicable as the buyer had a variable interest in and was the primary beneficiary 
as the primary beneficiary  the buyer could incur the expected losses that could arise from the variability of the fair value of variable interest entity 
as a result  we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of those entities holding our longview  washington assets into balance sheet classifications of investment in deconsolidated subsidiaries in the amount of million as a current asset  and non controlling interest variable interest entity in the amount of million as a current liability 
the investment in deconsolidated subsidiaries reflects the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the variable interest entity that contain the assets that will be disposed of under the asset purchase agreement see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the variable interest entity 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we did not have any other off balance sheet arrangements as of december  recently issued pronouncements at the september meeting of the eitf  the sec staff announced guidance on the use of the residual method to value acquired intangible assets other than goodwill in a business combination eitf topic d 
the sec concluded that the residual method does not comply with the requirements of sfas no 
 business combinations 
instead  a direct value method should be used to determine the fair value of all intangible assets required to be recognized under sfas no 
similarly  impairment testing of intangible assets should not rely on a residual method and instead  should comply with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of the guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  as revised  share based payment 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board abp opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the scope of sfas r includes a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in their financial statements the compensation expense relating to share based payment transactions that would include all stock options that have future vesting provisions  as modified  or as newly granted beginning on the grant date of such options 
prior to the effective date of this revision  sfas no 
permitted entities the option of applying the guidance in apb opinion no 
 as long as the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed what net income loss would have been had the company used the preferable fair value based method 
we will be required to implement sfas r for the interim reporting period beginning july  if sfas r had been adopted for the years ended december   and  net income loss would have been negatively impacted by million per basic and fully diluted share  million per basic share and fully diluted share  and million per basic and fully diluted share  respectively 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current treatment of stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets  which requires that the accounting for the exchange be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished  and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the provisions in sfas no 
are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in the interim reporting period beginning july  early application is permitted and companies must apply the standard prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the amount of reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  these estimates have been a reliable method to recognize revenues and it is expected that this method will not change in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make payments to us 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances  with historical reserves averaging less than of our outstanding receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances could be required 
the effect of an increase in our allowance of of our outstanding receivables as of december   from to or million to million from million  would result in a decrease in net income of million  net of taxes  net income per share diluted of for the year ended december  radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december  we had recorded approximately billion in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill  which represented approximately of our total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must conduct annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and our estimate of the value contains assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
these variables would include but not be limited to the forecast growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures and the likely media competition within the market area 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of taxes  for broadcasting licenses in certain of our markets 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of these assets 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of effective tax rates we evaluate our effective tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
tax contingencies are also recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
in addition  when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining if a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
our estimate of our effective tax rates has not changed significantly in past years  with rates that ranged from to 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rates as of december   would result in an increase in income tax expense of million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense would result in a decrease in net income of million net income per share diluted of for the year ended december  intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future see risk factors below for a discussion of the risks associated with the renewal of licenses 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for radio station operating expenses  including wages  and equipment 
the exact impact is indeterminable 
risk factors many statements contained in this report are forward looking in nature 
these statements are based on current plans  intentions or expectations and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans  intentions or expectations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are the following we face many unpredictable business risks  both general and specific to the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business including economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry  shifts in population  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  satellite radio  television stations and other entertainment and communications media  technological changes and innovations  new laws  including proposals to eliminate the tax deductibility of certain expenses incurred by advertisers  and changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the department of justice  the federal trade commission and the fcc 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot with any degree of certainty predict what effect  if any  these variables will have on our future operations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recession or downturn 
consequently  our advertising revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the united states economy  the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations  or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 
our radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues 
our radio broadcasting stations are in a highly competitive business 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media  such as newspapers  magazines  network and cable television  outdoor advertising and direct mail 
audience ratings and market shares are subject to change  and any change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market 
while we already compete in some of our markets with other stations with similar programming formats  if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of our stations  if a new station were to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter into the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
we cannot be assured that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
the fcc has recently begun more vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of am and am the fcc has recently indicated that it is enhancing its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency and has threatened on more than one occasion to initiate license revocation proceedings against a broadcast licensee who commits a serious indecency violation 
legislation has been introduced in congress that would dramatically increase the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming and potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualification proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
in addition  the fcc s heightened focus on the indecency regulatory scheme  against the broadcast industry generally  may encourage third parties to oppose our license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations 
several of our stations are currently subject to indecency related inquiries and or proposed fines at the fcc s enforcement bureau and we may in the future become subject to additional inquiries or proceedings related to our stations broadcast of indecent or obscene material 
to the extent that these inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines  a settlement with the fcc  revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications  our results of operation and business could be materially adversely affected 
we are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act see for example  the discussion of fcc regulations contained in part i  item i of this form k 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot be assured that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
the fcc s rules governing our radio station operations impose costs on our operations  and changes in those rules could have an adverse effect on our business 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot be assured that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 
we must respond to the increased competition for audio distribution and the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services 
there is increased competition for audio distribution 
the fcc has introduced new technologies to the broadcasting industry 
in addition  there are numerous other audio technologies that compete for the attention of listeners 
these new technologies and services  some of which are commercial free  include the following satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  personal digital audio devises eg  audio via wifi  mobile phones  ipods and mp players  digital radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on the financial condition and results of operations of our company 
we may not be successful in identifying and consummating future acquisitions  which is an important element of our business strategy 
we pursue growth  in part  through the acquisition of individual radio stations and groups of radio stations 
our consummation of all future acquisitions will be subject to various conditions  including fcc and other regulatory approvals 
the fcc must approve any transfer of control or assignment of broadcast licenses 
in addition  acquisitions may encounter intense scrutiny under federal and state antitrust laws 
our future acquisitions may be subject to notification under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and to a waiting period and possible review by the department of justice and the federal trade commission 
any delays  injunctions  conditions or modifications by any of these federal agencies could have a negative effect on us and result in the abandonment of all or part of attractive acquisition opportunities 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in identifying future acquisition opportunities or what the consequences will be of any acquisitions 
depending on the nature  size and timing of future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
we cannot be assured that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
we compete with many other buyers for the acquisition of radio stations 
some of those competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources 
as a result of these and other factors  our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions is uncertain 
we may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions 
the integration of acquisitions involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the management of a large and geographically diverse group of stations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired stations 
the risks of integration are magnified during any period of significant growth 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to integrate successfully any operations  systems or management that might be acquired in the future 
in addition  in the event that the operations of a new business do not meet expectations  we may restructure or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the new business 
we have substantial indebtedness which could have important consequences to you 
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity 
at december   we had long term indebtedness of million excluding outstanding letters of credit of million and shareholders equity of million 
this indebtedness is substantial in amount and could have an impact on us 
for example  these obligations could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including funding future expansion and ongoing capital expenditures  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions 
as of december   million was available under our million current bank revolver  subject to compliance with the covenants under the bank revolver at the time of borrowing 
moreover  under certain circumstances  we may need to modify or enter into a new bank facility to close on any future acquisitions 
we also may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing for any or all of the following transactions the acquisition of radio stations  the full or partial redemption of our outstanding debt  the payment of a dividend  and the buyback of our class a common stock 
we have no assurances that we will be able to obtain other funding  additional financing or the approvals  if necessary  for any of these transactions 
any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our indebtedness and the associated risks 
the covenants in our bank revolver  and our senior subordinated notes restrict our financial and operational flexibility 
our bank revolver and our senior subordinated notes contain covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  or merge or consolidate 
an event of default under our bank revolver or our senior subordinated notes could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
we have pledged substantially all of the stock of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under our bank revolver 
if the amounts outstanding under the senior subordinated notes were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against the stock of our subsidiaries 
a default under our senior subordinated notes could cause a default under our bank revolver 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our senior bank agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by operating performance or other events beyond our control  and we cannot be assured that we will meet those ratios 
we also may incur future debt obligations in connection with future acquisitions that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 
the debt we expect to incur in connection with future acquisitions may require us to modify or enter into a new bank facility if certain covenants in our current bank facility would be violated  subjecting us to an event of default 
because of our holding company structure  we depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow  and our access to this cash flow is restricted 
we operate as a holding company 
all of our radio stations are currently owned and operated by our subsidiaries 
entercom radio  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  is the borrower under our credit facility and our senior subordinated debt 
all of our station operating subsidiaries and fcc license subsidiaries are subsidiaries of entercom radio  llc 
further  we guaranteed entercom radio  llc s obligations under the bank revolver on a senior secured basis and under the senior subordinated notes on an unsecured basis  junior to our bank revolver 
as a holding company  our only source of cash to pay our obligations  including corporate overhead and other trade payables  are distributions from our subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow 
we currently expect that the net earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations  including servicing their debt obligations  before distributions are made to us 
even if our subsidiaries elect to make distributions to us  we cannot be assured that applicable state law and contractual restrictions  including the dividend covenants contained in our bank revolver and senior subordinated notes  would permit such dividends or distributions 
our chairman of the board and our president and chief executive officer effectively control our company  and members of their immediate family also own a substantial equity interest in us 
their interests may conflict with your interest 
as of february   joseph m 
field  our chairman of the board  beneficially owns  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock  representing approximately of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
as of february   david j 
field  our president  chief executive officer  one of our directors and the son of joseph m 
field  beneficially owns  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our outstanding class b common stock  representing approximately of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
collectively  joseph m 
field and david j 
field and other members of the field family beneficially own all of our outstanding class b common stock 
other members of the field family also own shares of class a common stock 
shares of class b common stock are transferable only to joseph m 
field  david j 
field  certain of their family members or trusts for any of their benefit 
upon any other transfer  shares of our class b common stock automatically convert into shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis 
shares of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes only when they are voted by joseph m 
field or david j 
field  subject to certain exceptions where they are restricted to one vote 
joseph m 
field generally is able to control the vote on all matters submitted to the vote of shareholders and  therefore  is able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters where the shares of our class b common stock are only entitled to one vote and those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws or applicable law  including  without limitation  the election of the two class a directors 
without the approval of joseph m 
field  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which investors might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
future sales by joseph m 
field or members of his family could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock the market for our class a common stock could fall substantially if joseph m 
field or members of his family sell large amounts of shares of our class a common stock in the public market  including any shares of our class b common stock as described in the above paragraph which are automatically converted to class a common stock 
these sales or the possibility that these sales could occur could make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling equity or equity related securities in the future 
the difficulties associated with any attempt to gain control of our company could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock 
joseph m 
field controls the decision as to whether a change in control will occur for our company 
there are also provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation  by laws and pennsylvania law that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company 
in addition  fcc approval for transfers of control of fcc licenses and assignments of fcc licenses are required 
these restrictions and limitations could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock 
we depend on selected market clusters of radio stations 
for the year ended december   we generated in excess of of our net revenues in of our markets seattle  boston  kansas city  sacramento  portland and denver 
accordingly we may have greater exposure to adverse events or conditions that affect the economy in any of these markets that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the ownership rules effectively decrease the number of available buyers for any radio stations we sell  which may have a negative impact on the sales price of radio stations 
the continued existence of any cross media rules may limit the prospective buyers in the market of any stations we may wish to sell 
the ownership rules also effectively prevent us from selling stations in a market to a buyer that has reached its ownership limit in the market 
our stock price could be volatile and could drop unexpectedly 
our class a common stock has been publicly traded since january  the market price of our class a common stock has been subject to fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering 
the stock market has from time to time experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could materially decline  regardless of our operating performance 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key executives
