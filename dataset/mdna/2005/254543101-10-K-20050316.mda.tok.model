the company rapidly responds to the demands of the global marketplace by continuing to increase its investment in research and development  and by focusing on expanding its product portfolio and closely controlling product quality and time to market 
as a result of the company shifting development priorities toward specialized configurations  such as the company s high density array devices  the company is introducing a range of new products that improve the trade off between size  performance and power consumption for surface mount packages 
the majority in of our sales are to major oems such as intel corporation  cisco systems incorporated  sony corporation  nortel networks corporation  delphi automotive  bose corporation  scientific atlanta incorporated  samsung electronics  asustek computer  inc  quanta and lg electronics  inc our distribution network of sales includes major distributors such as arrow electronics  inc  avnet  inc  digi key corporation  future electronics ltd  jaco electronics  inc  reptron electronics  inc  and all american semiconductor  inc 
because of the electronics industry trend towards moving manufacturing to lower operating cost countries in asia  the company has focused primarily on customers in china  taiwan  korea and hong kong 
we sell to asian customers of sales primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries  diodes taiwan and diodes hong kong 
the asian discrete semiconductor market is the largest and fastest growing market in which the company participates 
an increase in the percentage of sales in asia is expected as we have significantly increased our sales presence there and believe there is greater potential to increase market share in that region due to the expanding base of electronics product manufacturers 
our corporate headquarters located just outside los angeles in westlake village  california  which provides sales  marketing  engineering  logistics and warehousing functions  sells primarily to north american manufacturers and distributors of sales 
due to the manufacturing shift  the north american discrete semiconductor market is now the smallest market and its growth rate is far less than all other markets 
the majority of our applications engineers are located in the us in order to work with the customers design engineers 
whether the end application is ultimately manufactured in the us or in asia  our world wide sales organization is well positioned to provide sales and support to the customer 
in order to take advantage of the relatively robust european market  offices in toulouse  france and hattenheim  germany support our european sales expansion of sales 
asian sales are also generated from shanghai kaihong electronics co  ltd 
diodes china or kaihong  and diodes shanghai  owned manufacturing facilities in shanghai  china  with offices in shanghai and shenzhen  china  as well as from fabtech incorporated diodes fabtech or fabtech  a silicon wafer manufacturer acquired in december located near kansas city  missouri 
revenues were derived from the following countries all others represents countries with less than of total revenues each in thousands revenue of total revenue revenue of total revenue united states united states taiwan taiwan china china korea korea all others all others total total manufacturing and significant vendors diodes china and diodes shanghai  both located in shanghai  china  are our owned joint venture manufacturing facilities 
since diodes china s inception in  we have invested approximately million in plant and state of the art equipment in china 
both factories manufactures product for sale by our us and asian operations  and also sells to external customers as well 
at diodes china and diodes shanghai  silicon wafers are received and inspected in a highly controlled clean room environment awaiting the assembly operation 
at the first step of assembly  the wafers are sawn with very thin  high speed diamond blades into tiny semiconductor dice  numbering as many as  per diameter wafer 
dice are then loaded onto a handler  which automatically places the dice  one by one  onto lead frames  which are package specific  where they are bonded to the lead frame pad 
next  automatic wire bonders make the necessary electrical connections from the die to the leads of the lead frame  using micro thin gold wire 
the fully automatic assembly machinery then molds the epoxy case around the die and lead frame to produce the desired semiconductor product 
after a trim  form  test  mark and re test operation  the parts are placed into special carrier housings and a cover tape seals the parts in place 
the taped parts are then spooled onto reels and boxed for shipment 
acquired from lsc in december  our wafer foundry  diodes fabtech  is located in lee s summit  missouri 
diodes fabtech manufactures primarily inch silicon wafers  which are the building blocks for semiconductors 
fabtech purchases polished silicon wafers and then  by using various technologies and patents  in conjunction with many chemicals and gases  fabricates several layers on the wafers  including epitaxial silicon  ion implants  dielectrics and metals  with various patterns 
depending upon these layers and the die size which is determined during the photolithography process and completed at the customer s packaging site where the wafer is sawn into square or rectangular die  different types of wafers with various currents  voltages and switching speeds are produced 
in  our largest external supplier of products was lsc  a related party 
approximately and of our sales were from product manufactured by lsc in and  respectively 
also  in and  approximately and  respectively of our sales were from product manufactured by companies owned by keylink international a related party 
in addition  sales of products manufactured by diodes china and diodes fabtech  our manufacturing subsidiaries  were approximately and in  respectively  versus and in  respectively 
we anticipate that diodes china will become an increasingly valuable supplier 
no other manufacturer of discrete semiconductors accounted for more than and of our sales in and  respectively 
all of the raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available both domestically and abroad 
although we believe alternative sources exist for the products of any of our suppliers  the loss of any one of its principal suppliers or the loss of several suppliers in a short period of time could have a materially adverse effect on our financial statements until an alternate source is located and has commenced providing such products or raw materials 
related parties we conduct business with two related party companies  lsc and its subsidiaries and keylink international formerly xing international and its subsidiaries 
lsc  a shareholder  is our largest shareholder  and keylink international is owned by our joint venture partner in diodes china and diodes shanghai

income taxes in accordance with the current taxation policies of the people s republic of china prc  diodes china received preferential tax treatment for the years ended december  through earnings were subject to tax rates from through  and from through due to a million permanent re investment of diodes china earnings in  earnings from through will continue to be taxed at one half the normal rate of the local and central government tax rate of 
the company has received indications from the local taxing authority in shanghai that the tax holiday may be extended beyond it is not known whether the taxing authority for the central government of the prc will participate in this extended tax holiday arrangement 
also due to the permanent re investment  the company recorded a million tax refund net of us taxes in the fourth quarter of earnings of diodes china are also subject to tax of by the local taxing authority in shanghai 
the local taxing authority waived this tax from through  and is expected to waive this tax in  but can re impose the tax at its discretion 
for  diodes shanghai s effective tax rate was 
as an incentive for the establishment of diodes shanghai  beginning in  earnings will be exempted from income tax for two years 
then  beginning in  earnings will be subject to of the standard tax rate for the following three years 
earnings of diodes taiwan are currently subject to a tax rate of  which is comparable to the us federal tax rate for c corporations 
earnings of diodes hong kong are currently subject to a tax for local sales and or local source sales  all other sales are foreign income tax free 
in accordance with united states tax law  the company receives credit against its us federal tax liability for corporate taxes paid in taiwan and china 
the repatriation of funds from taiwan and china to the company may be subject to state income taxes 
as of december   accumulated and undistributed earnings of diodes china are approximately million  including million of restricted earnings which are not available for dividends 
through march   the company had not recorded deferred us federal or state tax liabilities estimated to be million as of march  on these cumulative earnings since the company  at that time  considered this investment to be permanent  and had no plans or obligation to distribute all or part of that amount from china to the united states 
beginning in april  the company began to record deferred taxes on a portion of the earnings of diodes china in preparation of a dividend distribution 
in the year ended december   the company received a dividend of approximately million from its diodes china subsidiary  for which the tax effect is included in us federal and state taxable income 
as of december   the company has recorded million in deferred taxes on the cumulative earnings of diodes china 
the company is evaluating the need to provide additional deferred taxes for the future earnings of diodes china  diodes shanghai  and diodes hong kong to the extent such earnings may be appropriated for distribution to the company s corporate office in north america  and as further investment strategies with respect to foreign earnings are determined 
should the company s north american cash requirements exceed the cash that is provided through the domestic credit facilities  cash can be obtained from the company s foreign subsidiaries 
however  the distribution of any unappropriated funds to the us will require the recording of income tax provisions on the us entity  thus reducing net income 
on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act ajca into law 
originally intended to repeal the extraterritorial income eti exclusion  which had triggered tariffs by the european union  the ajca expanded to cover a wide range of business tax issues 
among other items  the ajca establishes a phased repeal of the eti  a new incentive tax deduction for us corporations to repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate a deduction equal to of cash dividends received in the year elected that exceeds a base period amount and significantly revises the taxation of us companies doing business abroad 
at december   the company made a minimum estimate for repatriating cash from its subsidiaries in china and hong kong of million under the ajca  and recorded an income tax expense of approximately million 
under the guidelines of the ajca  the company will develop a required domestic reinvestment plan  covering items such as us bank debt repayment  us capital expenditures and us research and development activities  among others  to cover the million minimum dividend repatriation 
in addition  the company will complete a quantitative analysis of the benefits of the ajca  the foreign tax credit implications  and state and local tax consequences of a dividend to maximize the tax benefits of a dividend

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based upon historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when delivery has occurred  when our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers  which is generally when our product is shipped to both original equipment manufacturers oems and electronics component distributors 
we reduce revenue in the period of sale for estimates of product returns  distributor price adjustments and other allowances  the majority of which are related to our north american operations 
our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of revenues  distributor inventories  price adjustments  average selling prices and market conditions 
actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions  resulting in an adjustment to revenues 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out method 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our inventory  both finished goods and raw material  for obsolescence and slow moving items 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels  sales projections  and purchases by item  as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities 
based upon this analysis  as well as an inventory aging analysis  we accrue a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates  an inventory adjustment may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
management continually evaluates its deferred tax asset as to whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if management ever determined that its deferred tax asset was not likely to be realized  a write down of the asset would be required and would be reflected as an expense in the accompanying period 
allowance for doubtful accounts management evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors  including the current business environment and historical experience 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect on operating expense 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   goodwill was million million related to the fabtech acquisition  and million related to diodes china 
beginning in fiscal with the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
as a result of the company s adoption of sfas no 
 an independent appraiser hired by the company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill annually and has determined that the goodwill is fully recoverable 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our impairment review process is based upon i an income approach from a discounted cash flow analysis  which uses our estimates of revenues  costs and expenses  as well as market growth rates  and ii a market multiples approach which measures the value of an asset through an analysis of recent sales or offerings or comparable public entities 
if ever the carrying value of the goodwill is determined to be less than the fair value of the underlying asset  a write down of the asset will be required  with the resulting expense charged in the period that the impairment was determined 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage that certain items in the statement of income bear to net sales and the percentage dollar increase decrease of such items from period to period 
percent of net sales percentage dollar increase decrease year ended december  year ended december  to to to to net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense  net other income income loss before taxes and minority interest income tax benefit provision minority interest net income operating expenses include loss on sale and impairment of fixed assets of   and  in  and  respectively 
the following discussion explains in greater detail the consolidated financial condition of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
earnings per share discussion reflects three for two stock split in november all per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
year compared to year net sales for increased million to million from million for the increase was due primarily to an approximately increase in units sold as a result of increased demand for the company s products  as well as a more favorable pricing environment compared to in  average selling prices asps for discrete products increased approximately while asps for wafers fell approximately  consequently  overall asps decreased approximately from cost of goods sold increased million  or  for compared to as a percent of sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for to for the company s average unit cost aup for discrete devices decreased approximately from  and aups for wafer products decreased approximately 
these cost decreases were due primarily to improved manufacturing efficiencies 
gross profit for increased to million from million for of the million increase  million was due to the basis point increase in gross profit margin from in to in  while million was due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit increases in asia were the primary contributor to the gross profit increase in gross profit margin in the both the third and fourth quarter of increased to due to enhanced capacity utilization  continuing manufacturing efficiencies  relatively stable pricing  and a product mix that continues to shift towards higher value performance discretes and arrays 
for  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million to million from million for the increase in sg a was due primarily to higher sales commissions  incentives  marketing and royalty expenses associated with the increase in sales  and higher labor and benefit expenses 
also contributing to the increased sg a were higher corporate and administrative expenses  including legal and accounting fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
however  as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to for from last year 
research and development expenses r d increased to million  or of sales  in from million  or of sales  in r d expenses are primarily related to new product development at the silicon wafer level  and  to a lesser extent  at the packaging level 
we continue to seek to hire qualified engineers who fit our focus on next generation discrete processes and packaging technologies 
our goal is to expand r d to of revenue as we bring proprietary technology and advanced devices to the market 
net interest expense for decreased  to  from  in  due primarily to a decrease in the use of the company s credit facilities  as well as lower interest rates 
in  the company paid down million on its credit facilities  reducing the balance from million to million 
other expense for increased  compared to last year  primarily due to approximately  in currency exchange losses related to the weakened us dollar  primarily versus the taiwan dollar recorded in the fourth quarter of the effective tax rate in was compared to in the company recorded a provision for income taxes in the amount of million for the year  compared to million for included in the tax provision in is million in deferred taxes recorded in the fourth quarter for a minimum million planned foreign dividend distribution in under the american jobs creation act of  offset by a million foreign investment tax refund net of us taxes  and a million research and development tax credit 
the minority interest in joint venture represents the minority investor s share of the diodes china and diodes shanghai joint venture s income for the period 
the increase in the joint venture earnings for is primarily the result of increased sales of higher margin products 
the joint venture investment is eliminated in consolidation of the company s financial statements  and the activities of diodes china and diodes shanghai are included therein 
as of december   the company had a controlling interest in the joint ventures 
the company generated net income of million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share in  as compared to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for this increase is due primarily to the sales increase at gross profit margins of compared to gross profit margins of in year compared to year net sales for increased million to million from million for the increase was due primarily to a increase in units sold as a result of increased demand for the company s products  as well as a more favorable pricing environment compared to in  average selling prices asps for discrete products increased while asps for wafers fell  consequently  overall asps decreased 
gross profit for increased to million from million for of the million increase  million was due to the increase in gross profit margin from in to in  while million was due to the increase in net sales

also contributing to the increased sg a were higher corporate and administrative expenses  including legal and accounting fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
sg a  as a percentage of sales  increased to for from last year 
r d expenses increased to million  or of sales  in from million  or of sales  in r d expenses are primarily related to new product development at the silicon wafer level  and  to a lesser extent  at the packaging level 
in  operating profit margins were negatively affected by a million reserve for fixed asset impairment  primarily as a result of the re engineering of our wafer production lines 
during the year  we took advantage of opportunities to purchase more efficient equipment at discounts 
as a result  we retired un depreciated equipment that was replaced 
net interest expense for decreased  to  from million in  due primarily to a decrease in the use of the company s credit facilities  as well as lower interest rates 
in  the company paid down million on its long term debt  reducing the balance  net of current portion from million to million 
other expense for increased  compared to last year  primarily due to the discontinuance of income diodes fabtech was receiving from an external company s use of its testing facilities in  a decrease in high technology grant income received at diodes china in  and currency exchange losses primarily in asia in  partly offset by a severance payment in accordance with the terms of a separation agreement in  as well as the reduction in the expense recorded for the management incentive agreement at diodes fabtech in the effective tax rate in was compared to in  due primarily to a higher proportion of income earned by our asian subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions 
the company is benefiting from its diodes hong kong subsidiary  established in  not only due to its lower tax rates  but also as another entry point into the asia market 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes in the amount of million for the year  compared to million for included in the tax provision in is  in deferred taxes recorded for a portion of the earnings at diodes china  and  for a portion of the earnings at diodes hong kong 
the minority interest in joint venture represents the minority investor s share of the diodes china joint venture s income for the period 
the increase in the joint venture earnings for is primarily the result of increased sales 
the joint venture investment is eliminated in consolidation of the company s financial statements  and the activities of diodes china are included therein 
as of december   the company had a controlling interest in the joint venture 
the company generated net income of million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share in  as compared to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for this increase is due primarily to the sales increase at gross profit margins of compared to gross profit margins of in financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise from the funding of its working capital needs  primarily inventory  work in process and accounts receivable  as well as capital expenditures 
the company s primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s bank credit facilities 
any withdrawal of support from its banks could have adverse consequences on the company s liquidity 
the company s liquidity depends  in part  on customers paying within credit terms  and any extended delays in payments or changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on the company s cash flow 
in addition  any abnormal product returns or pricing adjustments may also affect the company s source of short term funding 
at december  the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  an increase of million from december  cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities in were net income of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
the primary sources in were depreciation and amortization of million and net income of million 
the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities in were depreciation and amortization of million and net income of million 
the primary use of cash flows from operating activities in was an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase of inventory of million 
the primary use of cash flows from operating activities in was an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the primary use of cash flows from operating activities in was an increase in accounts receivable of million 
for the year ended december   accounts receivable increased compared to the increase in sales  as days sales outstanding increased from to days due primarily to a trend in longer payment terms  primarily from far east customers as well as major distributors 
the company continues to closely monitor its credit terms  while at times providing extended terms as required 
the ratio of the company s current assets to current liabilities on december  was to  compared to a ratio of to and to as of december  and  respectively 
cash used by investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in the primary investments were for additional manufacturing equipment and expansion at the diodes china and diodes shanghai manufacturing facilities  and to a lesser extent  for capacity increases at diodes fabtech 
on december   the company purchased all the outstanding capital stock of fabtech incorporated  a inch wafer foundry located in lee s summit  missouri from lite on semiconductor corporation lsc  the company s largest stockholder 
the acquisition purchase price consisted of approximately million in cash plus fabtech was obligated to repay an aggregate of approximately million of debt  consisting of i an approximately million note payable to lsc  ii an approximately million note payable to the company  and iii an approximately million note payable to a financial institution which was repaid on december  with the proceeds of a capital contribution by the company 
the acquisition was financed internally and through bank credit facilities 
in june  according to the company s us bank covenants  diodes fabtech was not permitted to make regularly scheduled principal and interest payments to lsc on the remaining million payable related to the fabtech acquisition note  but was  however  able to renegotiate with lsc the terms of the note 
under the terms of the amended and restated subordinated promissory note  payments of approximately  plus interest were scheduled to begin again in july  provided the company met the terms of its us bank s covenants 
in may  the company renegotiated the terms of the note with lsc to extend the payment period from two years to four years  and accordingly  monthly payments of approximately  plus interest began in july cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in  and cash used by financing activities of million in the primary source of cash in was the receipt of million from stock option exercises 
at december   the company s total bank credit facility of million encompasses one major us bank  three banks in mainland china and five in taiwan 
as of december   the total credit lines were million  million  and million  for the us facility secured by substantially all assets  the unsecured chinese facilities  and the unsecured taiwanese facilities  respectively 
as of december   the available credit was million  million  and million  for the us facility  the chinese facilities  and the taiwanese facilities  respectively 
in february  the company and its us bank renewed its million revolving credit line  extending it for two years 
in july  diodes fabtech obtained a million credit facility to be used for capital expenditure requirements at its wafer fabrication facility 
this million facility brought the company s total credit facility to million  with the total available and unused credit at december  of million 
the credit agreements have certain covenants and restrictions  which  among other matters  require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and operating results  as defined in the agreements  and prohibit the payment of dividends 
the company was in compliance with its covenants as of december the company has used its credit facilities primarily to fund the capacity expansion at diodes china or diodes shanghai and to a lesser extent diodes fabtech  as well as for the fabtech acquisition  and to support all operations 
the company believes that the continued availability of these credit facilities  together with internally generated funds  will be sufficient to meet the company s current foreseeable operating cash requirements 
the company had entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major us bank which expired november   to hedge its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows resulting from interest rate risk related to a portion of its long term debt 
the interest rate under the swap agreement was fixed at and is based on the notional amount 
the swap contract was inversely correlated to the related hedged long term debt and was therefore considered an effective cash flow hedge of the underlying long term debt 
the level of effectiveness of the hedge is measured by the changes in the market value of the hedged long term debt resulting from fluctuation in interest rates 
as a matter of policy  the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
total working capital increased to million as of december   from million as of december  the company believes that such working capital position will be sufficient for foreseeable operations and growth opportunities 
the company s total debt to equity ratio improved to at december   from at december  it is anticipated that this ratio may increase should the company use its credit facilities to fund additional inventory sourcing opportunities 
the company has no material plans or commitments for capital expenditures other than in connection with manufacturing expansion at diodes china  diodes shanghai and diodes fabtech 
however  to ensure that the company can secure reliable and cost effective inventory sourcing to support and better position itself for growth  the company is continuously evaluating additional internal manufacturing expansion  as well as additional outside sources of products 
the company believes its financial position will provide sufficient funds should an appropriate investment opportunity arise and thereby  assist the company in improving customer satisfaction and in maintaining or increasing market share 
based upon plans for new product introductions  product mixes  capacity restraints on certain product lines and equipment upgrades  the company anticipates that year capital expenditures for the manufacturing facilities will be million 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that will affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we have no special purpose entities that provided off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support  nor do we engage in leasing  hedging except for the interest rate swap agreement  or research and development services  that could expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements

 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 which provides guidance on the identification of and reporting for variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
expands the criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest interpretation no 
is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
interpretation no 
was effective for the company in because the company entered into a joint venture for diodes shanghai 
the company has a interest 
the interpretation requires unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries 
the primary beneficiary is the party that assumes the majority of the risk  which includes  but is not limited to  the entity s expected losses

based upon our review  we concluded that management s analysis and the conclusions contained therein appeared reasonable

on october   a new tax law was passed  the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act  which raised a number of issues with respect to accounting for income taxes 
in response  on december   the fasb issued two fasb staff positions fsp  fsp application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of and fsp accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  which became effective for the company upon issuance 
the jobs creation act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  to be phased in from through  which is intended to replace the existing extra territorial income exclusion for foreign sales 
in fsp  the fasb decided the deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction under sfas no 
 rather than as a rate reduction 
accordingly  any benefit from the deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the tax return and no adjustment to deferred taxes at december   is required 
the jobs creation act also creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act 
fsp addresses when to reflect in the financial statements the effects of the one time tax benefit on the repatriation of foreign earnings 
under sfas no 
 companies are normally required to reflect the effect of new tax law changes in the period of enactment 
fsp provides companies additional time to determine the amount of earnings  if any  that they intend to repatriate under the jobs creation act s provisions 
see note for more discussion of the impact of the jobs creation act  including the company s status on the repatriation of foreign earnings 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r 
this new standard requires companies to adopt the fair value methodology of valuing stock based compensation and recognizing that valuation in the financial statements from the date of grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s result of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will partially depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as shown in the stock based compensation table see note 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
the company is currently evaluating several option valuation models in order to calculate the required compensation expense 
the company has elected to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r on a modified prospective application method effective july   with no restatement of any prior periods 
sfas no 
r is effective for the company as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in asia 
the company s foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon the company s financial results 
certain of the company s assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  and liabilities exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
these currencies are principally the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar  the japanese yen  and the hong kong dollar 
because of the relatively small size and nature of each individual currency exposure  the company does not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
therefore  the company could experience currency gains and losses 
during the asian financial crisis  the chinese government resisted devaluing the renminbi rmb chinese currency 
china is again faced with international pressure demanding the appreciation of the rmb 
should the chinese government allow a significant rmb appreciation  and the company not take appropriate means to offset this exposure  the effect could have an adverse impact upon the company s financial results 
interest rate risk 
the company has credit agreements with us and far east financial institutions at interest rates equal to libor or similar indices plus a negotiated margin 
a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon the company s cost of working capital and its interest expense 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows resulting from interest rate risk related to a portion of its long term debt 
at november  the interest rate swap agreement on the company s long term debt has expired 
the swap contract was inversely correlated to the related hedged long term debt and was therefore considered an effective cash flow hedge of the underlying long term debt 
the level of effectiveness of the hedge is measured by the changes in the market value of the hedged long term debt resulting from fluctuation in interest rates 
as a matter of policy  the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
political risk 
the company has a significant portion of its assets in mainland china and taiwan 
the possibility of political conflict between the two countries or with the united states could have an adverse impact upon the company s ability to transact business through these important business segments and to generate profits
