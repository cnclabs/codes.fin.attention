impaired properties include foreclosure properties in kansas  missouri  massachusetts and new hampshire 
nhc has been retained to manage these properties 
we are treating the kansas and missouri properties as foreclosure properties for federal income tax purposes in with certain elections  unqualified income generated by the properties is expected to be treated as qualified income for up to six years from the purchase date for purposes of the income source tests that must be satisfied by reits to maintain their tax status 
remic certificate valuations on december   nhi purchased for  a participating interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic in the form of one class of certificates issued in the aggregate principal amount of  the remic 
on november   nhi purchased for  a participating interest in a remic in the form of nine classes of certificates issued in the aggregate principal amount of  the remic 
remic during we collected  on the remic and extended the due date of the three remaining mortgages until december  during and the first six months of  we recognized additional interest income of  and  respectively  reflecting amortization of our carrying value to the amount ultimately expected to be collected in december collections of  were received during the first six months of  of which  the amount recognized as a writedown in is included in remic recoveries  and resulting in no balance outstanding at december  remic at december  and  the net carrying value of the remic was  we have from time to time received advances from the servicer of the remic that we did not record as interest income because of a potential obligation to repay the amounts to the servicer 
we received  of such advances prior to and  of such advances during the obligation to repay  of the advances was removed during  and we recorded that amount as interest income 
as of december   we had a remaining repayment obligation of  to the servicer 
at december   we had a repayment obligation of  after a reduction in interest income for of  during the second quarter of we applied the repayment obligation accrued of  against the carrying value of the remic  and recorded a writedown of  in value  resulting in no balance outstanding at december  no interest income was recognized on the remic during the year ended december  loan  realty and security loss recoveries during and  we determined  based on events occurring during those years and based on the provisions of sfas and sfas  that impairments of certain of our mortgage and real estate investments mentioned above had occurred 
these investments were affected by bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings  non receipt of payments and judgments about possible refinancing and other collateral values 
during  loan loss recoveries of  have been recorded 
the loan loss recoveries relate to gains realized on the sale of two mortgage loans related to somerset on lake saunders and colonial care 
these loans were previously identified as impaired in  as a result of management s analysis of the future expected cash flows  historical occupancy  and operating income of the projects 
it is possible that additional events could occur that would indicate a further impairment of the net carrying amount of our investments 
if such events occur  we will record additional loan loss provisions and realty impairment losses in the periods such events are known 
commitments we have received commitment fees for commitments to third parties to make loans and to fund construction projects totaling  commitments include investment amounts for which we have received a commitment fee but which have not been funded as of december  the following table sets forth certain information regarding our commitments as of december  commitments less than after facility type facilities one year one year total in thousands long term care   assisted living 

commitments   sources of revenues general 
our revenues are derived primarily from mortgage interest income  rental income and the operation of foreclosure properties 
during  mortgage interest income equaled  of which all except  was from non nhc borrowers 
rental income totaled   of which was from properties operated by nhc 
the interest and rental payments are primarily derived from the operations of the health care facilities 
the source and amount of revenues from such operations are determined by i the licensed bed or other capacity of the health care facilities  ii the occupancy rate of the health care facilities  iii the extent to which the services provided at each health care facility are utilized by the patients  iv the mix of private pay  medicare and medicaid patients at the health care facilities  and v the rates paid by private paying patients and by the medicare and medicaid programs 
facility operating revenues are derived from the operations of the foreclosure properties and are determined by similar factors 
governmental and other concerns regarding health care costs have and may continue to result in significant reductions in payments to health care facilities  and there can be no assurance that future payment rates for either governmental or private health care plans will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients 
any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care have and could continue to adversely affect revenues of our health related lessees and borrowers and thereby adversely affect those lessees and borrowers abilities to make their lease or debt payments to us 
failure of the lessees or borrowers to make their lease or debt payments would have a direct and material adverse impact on us 
medicare and medicaid 
a significant portion of the revenue of our foreclosure properties and our lessees and borrowers is derived from governmental funded reimbursement programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
medicare is a federal health insurance program under the social security act for individuals age and over and certain chronically disabled individuals 
the balanced budget act of bba made fundamental changes in the medicare program which have resulted in reduced levels of payment for a substantial portion of health care services 
amendments to the bba medicare enactments were made in late and late  which have enhanced operating revenues at medicare certified lessees and borrowers 
until october   when the enhancements expired again  substantially reducing payment levels  only modest increases were granted for the fiscal year beginning october  medicaid is a joint federal and state program designed to provide medical assistance to medically indigent persons 
these programs are operated by state agencies which adopt their own medical reimbursement formula and standards  and rates and covered services vary from state to state 
however  in many instances  revenues from medicaid programs are insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in providing care to those patients 
the medicare and medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation  adoption of rules and regulations  and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
moreover  health care facilities have experienced increasing pressures from private payors attempting to control health care costs  and reimbursement from private payors has in many cases effectively been reduced to levels approaching those of government payors 
governmental funding of medicare and medicaid 
substantial cuts in medicare payments to nursing home providers were made beginning with the implementation of the bba and the prospective payment system in congress attempted to partially address the financial stress caused by these cuts through the enactment of the balance budget refinement act bbra in the fall of and the benefits and improvement and protection act bipa in the majority of improvements brought about by bbra and bipa  however  expired on september   again causing financial stress in the industry 
effective for the fiscal year beginning october   the centers for medicare and medicaid services increased reimbursement for medicare part a by in addition to the annual inflationary increase of 
the october  increases are substantially less than were the october  cuts 
no material changes to reimbursement are expected until the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms refines the current rug iii case mix methodology 
furthermore  several of the states in which we have investments have actively sought ways to reduce or slow the increase of medicaid spending for nursing home care by such methods as capitated payments or reductions in reimbursement rates 
with capitated payments  the provider is responsible for providing  for a fixed fee  all services needed by certain patients 
capitated payments can result in significant losses if patients require extensive treatment not adequately covered by the capitated rate 
these cuts have caused significant financial stress in the long term care industry and to our tenants and borrowers  evidenced by bankruptcies and foreclosures 
the cuts have also negatively impacted our additional percentage rents and  in the case of renegotiated rents for troubled properties  the base rents we are paid from our skilled nursing facility tenants 
efforts to impose reduced payments  greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue 
any reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our tenants or borrowers 
we are unable to predict what reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be adopted in the future or the effect such changes will have on its operations 
no assurance can be given that such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on us  however  we believe the most material negative impact occurred during licensure and certification 
the health care industry is highly regulated by federal  state and local law  and is directly affected by state and local licensing requirements  facility inspections  state and federal reimbursement policies  regulations concerning capital and other expenditures  certification requirements  and other such laws  regulations and rules 
sanctions for failure to comply with these regulations and laws include but are not limited to loss of licensure  fines  and loss of certification to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs  as well as potential criminal penalties 
the failure of any lessee or borrower to comply with such laws  requirements and regulations could affect its ability to operate the facility or facilities and could adversely affect such lessee s or borrower s ability to make lease or debt payments to us 
in the past several years  due to rising health care costs  there has been an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
payment of any consideration in exchange for referral of medicare and medicaid patients is generally prohibited by federal statute  which subjects violators to severe penalties  including exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs  fines  and even prison sentences 
in recent years  both federal and state governments have significantly increased investigation and enforcement activity to detect and punish wrongdoers 
in addition  legislation has been adopted at both state and federal levels which severely restricts the ability of physicians to refer patients to entities in which they have a financial interest 
it is anticipated that the trend toward increased investigation and enforcement activity in the area of fraud and abuse  as well as self referral  will continue in future years 
certain of our investments are with lessees or borrowers which are partially or wholly owned by physicians 
in the event that any lessee or borrower were to be found in violation of laws regarding fraud and abuse or self referral  that lessee s or borrower s ability to operate the facility as a health care facility could be jeopardized  which could adversely affect the lessee s or borrower s ability to make lease or debt payments to us and thereby adversely affect us 
certificates of need 
certain health care facilities in which we invest are also generally subject to state statutes which may require regulatory approval  in the form of a certificate of need con prior to the addition or construction of new beds  the addition of services or certain capital expenditures 
con requirements are not uniform throughout the united states and are subject to change 
we cannot predict the impact of regulatory changes with respect to con s on the operations of our lessees and mortgagees  however  in our primary market areas  a significant reduction in new construction of long term care beds has occurred 
investment policies our investment objectives are i to provide current income for distribution to our stockholders through investments primarily in health care related facilities  ii to provide the opportunity to realize capital growth resulting from appreciation  if any  in the residual value of our portfolio properties  and iii to preserve and protect stockholders capital 
there can be no assurance that these objectives will be realized 
we anticipate making some new investments beginning in if we were to make new investments  we would consider such factors  as i the geographic area and type of property  ii the location  construction quality  condition and design of the property  iii the current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs and lease or mortgage obligations and to provide a competitive market return on equity to our investors  iv the growth  tax and regulatory environments of the communities in which the properties are located  v occupancy and demand for similar health care facilities in the same or nearby communities  vi the quality  experience and creditworthiness of the management operating the facilities located on the property  and vii the mix of private and government sponsored patients 
there can be no assurances that investments containing these attributes will be found or closed 
we will not  without the approval of a majority of the board of directors  enter into any joint venture relationships with or acquire from or sell to any director  officer  or employee of nhc or nhi  or any affiliate thereof  as the case may be  any of our assets or other property 
the board of directors  without the approval of the stockholders  may alter our investment policies if they determine that such a change is in our best interests and our stockholders best interests 
the methods of implementing our investment policies may vary as new investment and financing techniques are developed or for other reasons 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to make investments in health care related facilities or business when it is advisable in the opinion of the board of directors 
we may negotiate other lines of credit  or arrange for other short or long term borrowings from banks  nhc or otherwise 
we have and may arrange for long term borrowings from institutional investors or through public offerings 
we have invested and may in the future invest in properties subject to existing loans or secured by mortgages  deeds of trust or similar liens with favorable terms or remic investments 
advisory agreement we entered into the advisory agreement on october  with nhc as advisor under which nhc provided management and advisory services to us until november  under the advisory agreement  we engaged nhc to use its best efforts a to present to us a continuing and suitable investment program consistent with our investment policies adopted by the board of directors from time to time  b to manage our day to day affairs and operations  and c to provide administrative services and facilities appropriate for such management 
in performing its obligations under the advisory agreement  nhc was subject to the supervision of and policies established by our board of directors 
the advisory agreement was initially for a stated term which expired december  since then  the agreement was on a year to year term  but terminable on days notice  and terminable for cause at any time 
for and later years  the advisor was entitled to annual compensation which was calculated on a formula related to the increase in funds from operations per common share as defined in the advisory agreement 
in  the annual compensation expensed under the advisory agreement was approximately pursuant to the advisory agreement  the advisor manages all of our day to day affairs and provides all such services through its personnel or contractual agreements 
the advisory agreement provides that without regard to the amount of compensation received by the advisor under the advisory agreement  the advisor shall pay all expenses in performing its obligations including the employment expenses of the personnel providing services to us 
the advisory agreement further provides that nhi shall pay the expenses incurred with respect to and allocable to the prudent operation and business of nhi including any fees  salaries  and other employment costs  taxes and expenses paid to our directors  officers and employees who are not also employees of the advisor 
effective november   we assigned our advisory agreement with national healthcare corporation to a new independent company  healthcare advisors  llc  formed by nhi s president and board chairman  w 
andrew adams 
we believe it to be in the best interest of nhi to accentuate its independence from nhc  its largest tenant 
therefore  mr 
adams has assumed the responsibilities of the advisory agreement 
to assure independence from nhc  mr 
adams has resigned as ceo and terminated his managerial responsibilities with nhc 
he will initially out source most functions of the advisory agreement such as payroll processing  accounting and the like to nhc 
during the immediate future  mr 
adams will remain on the nhc board as chairman  focusing on strategic planning  but will have no management involvement with nhc 
we have a shareholder approved option exercise loan guaranty program  the purpose of which is to facilitate key personnel exercising options to purchase nhi common stock

item legal proceedings 
contingency related to damaged property one of our owned nursing home properties  leased to a subsidiary of nhc and located in nashville  tennessee  was damaged by a tragic fire on september  which resulted in the loss of life or critical injury to a number of patients 
the building has been closed to patient care and nhc has elected to terminate its lease on the property 
nhi is evaluating its options on the now empty building 
the lease  although terminated  requires nhc to indemnify and hold harmless nhi from any and all demands and claims arising from the use of the property including any negligence or violation by nhc  and this is being done 
nhi is a loss payee and additional named insured under the terms of nhc s property and casualty insurance policy 
the policy includes business interruption insurance and nhi has received a settlement equal to rent due on the facility through the lease termination date 
rent income from the center has produced approximately  annually 
furthermore  nhi is an additional named insured on nhc s professional and general liability insurance policy 
nhc has stated that the lessee  nhc healthcare nashville  llc and its parent nhc collectively have liability coverage of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate per location and annual aggregate excess coverage of  that is attributable to all of nhc s operated centers 
nhi has been named a defendant in thirty two lawsuits filed by patients and or representatives of patients arising out of the fire 
thirty of those lawsuits have been settled and dismissed 
the remaining two cases have been consolidated in the third circuit court for davidson county  tennessee 
discovery is ongoing in the remaining cases 
nhi plans to vigorously defend against the allegations in these lawsuits 
it is too early to make any assessment of any potential liability or cost to nhi 
at december   nhi has not accrued any liability for this contingent matter but will continue to closely monitor the situation 
there can be no assurance that claims will not exceed the limits of the insurance coverage or that additional claims will not be asserted against nhi 
nhi s potential liability from this incident or nhc s ability to meet any indemnification obligation to nhi cannot be determined at this time 
if nhc were unable to meet its obligations to nhi either as to indemnification  if required  or as to the payment of rent  it may have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
except as discussed above with respect to the nashville fire  we are not subject to any material pending litigation  although a number of our operators or mortgagors are currently in bankruptcy and or have multiple pending medical liability suits 
see foreclosures  troubled real estate properties  borrower bankruptcies  and non performing loans in item management s discussion 
the health care facilities are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business 
our lessees and mortgagees have indemnified and will continue to indemnify us against all liabilities arising from the operation of the health care facilities  and will indemnify us against environmental or title problems affecting the real estate underlying such facilities 
while there are lawsuits pending against certain of the owners and or lessees of the health care facilities  management believes that the ultimate resolution of all pending proceedings will have no material adverse effect on us or our operations 
through the operation of our foreclosure properties  we are subject to professional and general liability litigation for the provision of patient care 
the entire long term care industry has seen a dramatic increase in personal injury wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by nursing homes and their employees in providing care to residents 
we have maintained or caused the majority of our lessees or mortgagees to maintain insurance coverage for this type of litigation 
in florida  however  coverage is limited 
we are subject to certain claims  none of which  in management s opinion  would be material to our financial position or results of operations 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders

the limit on ownership of any other class of stock including issues convertible into common stock remains at of the outstanding stock 
in order to qualify for the beneficial tax treatment accorded to a reit  we must make quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock equal on an annual basis to at least of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains  as defined in the code 
cash available for distribution to our stockholders is primarily derived from interest payments received on our mortgages and from rental payments received under our leases 
all distributions will be made by us at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our cash flow and earnings  our financial condition  bank covenants contained in our financing documents and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
our reit taxable income is calculated without reference to our cash flow 
therefore  under certain circumstances  we may not have received cash sufficient to pay our required distributions

overview national health investors  inc nhi or the company is a real estate investment trust reit that invests primarily in income producing health care properties with emphasis on the long term care sector 
as of december   we had interests in real estate owned  and investments in mortgages  preferred stock and marketable securities resulting in total invested assets of  our mission is to invest in health care real estate which generates current income that will be distributed to stockholders 
we have pursued this mission by making mortgage loans and acquiring properties to lease nationwide primarily in the long term health care industry 
as of december   we were diversified with investments in health care facilities located in states consisting of long term care facilities  one acute care hospital  four medical office buildings  assisted living facilities  six retirement centers and residential projects for the developmentally disabled 
these investments consisted of approximately  aggregate carrying value amount of loans to borrowers and  of purchase leaseback transactions with lessees 
of these facilities  were acquired through foreclosure and are owned of which nine are operated by us and are leased to national healthcare corporation nhc 
the nine facilities operated by us and eight facilities operated by others are managed by subsidiaries of nhc 
nhc was our investment advisor until november   when we assigned our advisory agreement with national healthcare corporation to a new independent company formed by nhi s president and board chairman  w 
andrew adams 
consistent with our strategy of diversification  we have reduced the portion of our portfolio operated or managed by nhc from of total invested assets on october  to of total invested assets on december  at december   of the total invested assets of the health care facilities were operated by publicly traded operators  by regional operators  and by small operators 
areas of focus coinciding with the implementation of the prospective payment system for medicare payments to nursing homes in and the resulting decrease in revenues to health care providers  we significantly curtailed our new investments 
instead  we focused our attention on returning our non performing loans to performing status 
although our efforts are not complete  we continue to make progress in this regard 
we also focused on lowering our debt 
our debt to capitalization ratio on december  was  the lowest level in our year history 
our liquidity is also strong with cash and marketable securities of  exceeding our total debt outstanding of  at the end of reflecting this progress and our improving outlook for the healthcare industry  we anticipate making some new investments in while continuing to monitor and improve our existing properties 
even as we make new investments  however  we expect to maintain a relatively low level of debt vs 
equity compared to our historical levels 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates  judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows valuations and impairments to our investments since the long term health care industry has experienced material reductions in government and private insurance reimbursements 
while some legislative relief was granted in and  additional reductions in reimbursement were imposed effective october  followed by only modest improvements implemented for the fiscal year beginning october  the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments about refinancing for our lessees and mortgagees 
based on events occurring during years prior to  we determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred 
decisions about valuations and impairments of our investments require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for real estate properties  the need to recognize an impairment is evaluated on a property by property basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recognition of an impairment is based upon estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying amount of the property and may be affected by management s plans  if any  to dispose of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of loan payments and general economic conditions on a specific loan basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
on a quarterly basis  nhi reviews its notes receivable for recoverability when events or circumstances  including the non receipt of principal and interest payments  significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions  indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable 
if necessary  an impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or  if foreclosure is probable  the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable 
we evaluate our marketable securities for other than temporary impairments consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accountant standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
an impairment of a marketable security would be considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investment and evidence indicates the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties  notes receivable  marketable securities and other investments are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  there are certain of our customers for which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that revenue for interest or rent is not realizable 
for these nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income when assured  which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected 
we identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within days of the date it is due 
this policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight line basis as required under sfas to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible 
lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property  such as an increase in annual revenues over a base year revenues  are considered to be contingent rentals and are excluded from minimum lease payments in accordance with sfas reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition third party payors approximately two thirds of our facility operating revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the third party payors 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds we have generated net cash from operating activities during totaling  a decrease of  compared to  in the prior year 
net cash from operating activities generally includes net income plus non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  provision for investment losses  and working capital changes 
the  net cash provided from operating activities for is composed of increases due to net income of  and depreciation of  this was offset by net loan  realty  remic  and security recoveries of  gain on sale of real estate of  gain on sale of marketable securities of  discount and deferred income amortization of  and working capital increases of  net cash provided by operating activities decreased from  in to  in due primarily to an increase in working capital  and gains on sale of notes receivable and marketable securities in the  net cash provided from operating activities for is composed of increases due to net income of  depreciation of  and loan and realty impairment loss expense of  this was offset by gain on sale of real estate of  and discount and deferred income amortization of  net cash provided by investing activities during totaled  compared to  in the prior year

preferred stock conversion on april   of nhi s cumulative convertible preferred stock  with a balance of  shares or  was called by nhi for redemption into common stock of nhi at a conversion rate of 
shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock 
this resulted in an additional  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
consequently  preferred dividends for the year decreased  offset by increased common dividends of approximately  on the new common shares 
cash flow was increased by  in  due to the difference in total dividends paid on the newly issued common shares versus the dividends paid on the converted preferred stock

foreclosures  troubled real estate properties  borrower bankruptcies  and non performing loans our borrowers  tenants and the properties we operate as foreclosure properties have experienced financial pressures and difficulties similar to those experienced by the health care industry in general since governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower or at least slow the growth in payments to health care providers 
furthermore  the costs of professional liability insurance have increased significantly during this same period 
a number of our real estate property operators and mortgage loan borrowers have experienced bankruptcy 
others have been forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure and have otherwise failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us

furthermore   of additional rental income was recognized in from other leases 
the increase in facility operating revenues is due primarily to the improved government payment rates and census at our foreclosure properties in massachusetts  new hampshire  kansas and missouri for the year ended december  the improved government payment rates exceed any related increase in facility operating expenses  resulting in more profitable operations

the decrease in mortgage interest income is due to a decline in the average amount of mortgage investments outstanding as a result of collection of and foreclosure on mortgage loans and due to the discontinuation of interest income recognition in and on problem loans 
of the  decrease   is attributable to problem loans   is related to remics  and  is related to previous mortgage payoffs 
this decrease is offset by approximately  interest income in from a note receivable of  from national health realty  inc made on december  nhr repaid this note on december  the increase in rental income in resulted in part from additional rental income from marriott international brighton gardens of  from a settlement offset by a  reduction in rental income paid compared to increased rental income of  came from leases of certain alterra assisted living facilities  and  of the increase came from two new jersey centers obtained in january through foreclosure

for and  we have reclassified the operations  including the net gain on the sale of these facilities  as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas funds from operations our funds from operations ffo for the year ended december   on a diluted basis was  an increase of  as compared to  for the same period in ffo represents net earnings available to common stockholders  excluding the effects of asset dispositions  plus depreciation associated with real estate investments 
diluted ffo assumes  if dilutive  the conversion of convertible subordinated debentures  the conversion of cumulative convertible preferred stock and the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method 
we believe that funds from operations is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative  and should be supplemented with a measure such as ffo 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our funds from operations may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits 
since other reits may not use our definition of ffo  caution should be exercised when comparing our company s ffo to that of other reits 
funds from operations in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap funds from operations does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance  or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap in the united states  as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
we have complied with the sec s interpretation that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo 
the sec s position is that recurring impairments on real property are not an appropriate adjustment

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is generally effective for nhi july  the adoption of sfas has not had a material effect on nhi s financial statements 
in december the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised december fin r 
fin r provides guidance related to identifying variable interest entities previously known generally as special purpose entities or spes and determining whether such entities should be consolidated 
key to the consolidation determination is whether such entities disperse risks among the parties involved 
if those risks are not dispersed  and therefore an enterprise bears the majority of the risks or rewards related to the variable interest entity  it would consolidate that variable interest entity 
this interpretation also provides guidance related to the initial and subsequent measurement of assets  liabilities  and non controlling interests of newly consolidated variable interest entities and requires disclosures for both the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and other beneficiaries of the entity 
this interpretation replaces in its entirety fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  that was issued by the fasb in january the implementation of fin r was required during the company s first quarter of the implementation had no effect on the company s financial statements 
in december of  the fasb issued fasb statement no

statement 
statement amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  that was issued in the amendments made by statement are based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that he accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the provisions in statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  early application is permitted and companies must apply the standard prospectively 
the company plans to adopt statement beginning july  the future effect of statement on the company s financial statements will depend on whether the company enters into certain non monetary transactions 
the company  however  does not expect the adoption of statement to have a significant impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb has issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment statement r 
the new fasb rule requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements

the company will be required to apply statement r beginning july  the scope of statement r includes a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months when purchased 
all of our mortgage and other notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
our investment in preferred stock represents an investment in the preferred stock of another real estate investment trust and bears interest at a fixed rate of 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments and because the interest rates on our investments in notes receivable and preferred stock are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
as of december    of our debt bears interest at fixed interest rates 
because the interest rates of these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
the remaining  of our debt and  of our convertible subordinated debentures bear interest at variable rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would reduce our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments by  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would increase our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments by  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
the future use of such instruments will be subject to strict approvals by our senior officers 
equity price risk we consider our investments in marketable securities as available for sale securities and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with sfas the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
hypothetically  a change in quoted market prices would result in a related  change in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities 
in addition  a hypothetical change in the quoted market prices of our subordinated convertible debentures would result in a related  change in the fair value of the debenture instruments
