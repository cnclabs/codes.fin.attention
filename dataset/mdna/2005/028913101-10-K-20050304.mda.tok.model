item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the senior living industry is experiencing growth as a result of demographic changes and various other factors 
according to census data  the over age population in the united states is growing much faster than the general population 
we have seen increasing demand for services at both our retirement centers and our free standing assisted living communities during the past year  and expect that this demand will continue over the next several years 
as a general rule  economic factors that affect seniors will have a corresponding impact on the senior living industry 
for example  general concerns regarding lower interest rates on savings and uncertainty of investment returns have impacted seniors during the past several years  as well as uncertainties related to world events such as the iraqi war 
on the other hand  the continuing strength of the home resale market in most areas of the country has been beneficial to seniors  since the equity from the sale of a home is a significant source of funding for senior living care in many cases 
in addition  overall economic conditions and general consumer confidence can impact the senior living industry  since many adult children subsidize the cost for care of elderly parents  and share in decisions regarding their care 
the assisted living industry is maturing and rapidly evolving 
the demand for assisted living services increased significantly beginning with the emergence of the industry segment in the mid s 
however  the development of new assisted living communities across the country outstripped demand during this period  resulting in oversupply of unit capacity  longer fill up times  price pressures and deep discounting 
the steadily increasing demand for assisted living services  coupled with minimal new development activity  reduced much of the oversupply in many of our markets in and as a result  we were able to increase occupancy  increase rates and reduce promotional discounting for our free standing assisted living communities during and based on available industry data  we believe that new assisted living development in the near term will remain at sustainable levels and  accordingly  expect this trend to continue 
the average length of stay in our free standing assisted living community segment is approximately two years  which represents a challenge and an opportunity for us 
we must find a number of new residents to maintain and build occupancy 
however  we also have the opportunity to mark to market if we are able to attract new residents at higher current market rates  replacing prior residents with lower or discounted rates 
our retirement center segment is a more mature segment of the industry  and has seen demand and price increases in recent years  with new unit capacity entering the market at sustainable levels 
management expects this growth in demand and selling rate increases to continue over the next several years 
the average length of stay is much longer in our retirement centers  approximately five to seven years in the rental communities  and approximately ten to twelve years in the entrance fee communities 
in addition  we believe that many of our retirement centers benefit from significant barriers to entry from competitors  including the significant cost and length of time to develop competitive communities  certificate of need requirements for nursing beds in certain states  the difficulty in finding acceptable development sites in the geographical areas in which our retirement centers are located  and the length of time and difficulty in developing strong competitive reputations 
we earn our revenues primarily by providing housing and services to our residents 
approximately of our revenues come from private pay sources  meaning that residents or their families pay from their own funds or from the proceeds of their privately funded long term care policies 
all private pay residents are billed in advance for the next month s housing and care 
in addition  we receive private pay revenues from the sale of entrance fee contracts at our entrance fee communities 
while this cash is received at the time the resident moves in  the non refundable portion of the entrance fee is primarily recognized as income for financial reporting purposes over the actuarial life of the resident 
our most significant expenses are community operating expenses labor and labor related expenses for community associates represent approximately of this line item 
other significant items in this category are food costs  property taxes  utility costs  marketing costs and insurance 
general and administrative labor costs also represent the largest component for this category  comprising the home office and regional staff supporting community operations 
other significant items are liability reserve accruals and related costs  travel  and legal and professional service costs 
in response to higher liability insurance costs and deductibles in recent years  and the inherent liability risk in providing personal and health related services to seniors  we have significantly increased our staff and resources involved in quality assurance  compliance and risk management 
lease expense our lease expense has grown significantly over the past several years  as a result of the large number of sale leaseback transactions completed in connection with various financing transactions 
our lease expense includes the rent expense for all operating leases  including an accrual for lease escalators in future years the impact of these future escalators is spread evenly over the lease term for financial reporting purposes  and is reduced by the amortization of deferred gains on previous sale leaseback transactions 
depreciation and amortization expense we incur significant depreciation expense on our fixed assets primarily community buildings and equipment and amortization expense related primarily to leasehold acquisition costs 
interest expense our interest expense is comprised of interest on our outstanding debt  capital lease and financing obligations 
results of operations multi property sale leaseback and repayment of mezzanine loan on july   we completed a multi property sale leaseback transaction with health care property investors  inc  or hcpi 
in the transaction  we sold a substantial majority of our interest in the real property and improvements underlying two retirement centers and one free standing assisted living community  while retaining a interest in the real estate holding companies that own those three communities 
we also sold to hcpi all of our interest in the real property and improvements underlying one of our other retirement centers 
we continue to operate all four of the communities involved in the transaction under a master lease 
the proceeds from the transaction were used primarily to repay million of mortgage debt and the remaining million balance including accrued interest of our mezzanine loan with hcpi 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the july master lease has been accounted for as an operating lease for one of the retirement centers and as capital lease financing obligations with respect to the other three communities as a result of the lease structure  as well as our continuing ownership interest and other factors 
with an operating lease  lease payments and accruals for lease escalators are shown as lease expense 
with capital lease financing obligations  the related leased assets are recorded on our balance sheet  and the capital lease financing obligation is shown as a component of long term debt 
the capital lease financing treatment impacts our income statement in several ways  including the depreciation of the leased asset generally fully depreciated over the initial lease term  and a portion of each lease payment is considered to be interest expense with the balance of each lease payment being considered repayment of the capital lease financing obligation included in long term debt 
because of the capital lease financing treatment for these three communities  the amount of debt depicted on our balance sheet remained approximately the same following the transaction 
the july transaction resulted in a net decrease of million of our debt as a result of the repayment of the remaining million balance of the mezzanine loan  including million of accrued interest 
the repayment of million of mortgage debt 
a million reduction in consolidated mortgage debt on our balance sheet 
this debt was retained by the real estate holding companies  and the lease payments to these holding companies include a pass through of the periodic principal and interest costs of this debt 
our existing guarantee with respect to million of that debt was unchanged and remains in place 
a new capital lease financing obligation for the three leases in the amount of million  which is included in long term debt 
these lease obligations are being amortized over the initial ten year lease term 
a new mortgage loan in the amount of million 
for the community with the operating lease treatment  we realized a gain of approximately million  which was deferred and is being amortized over the initial ten year lease term 
no gain or loss was recognized for the three communities with capital lease financing treatment 
the july transaction positively impacted our pre tax income by approximately million per quarter approximately million per year beginning with the third quarter of  which is comprised of the following elements we generated interest savings of approximately million per quarter approximately million per year reflecting significantly reduced cost of debt resulting from the complete repayment of the mezzanine loan and the reduction of first mortgage debt  offset by the interest expense portion of the payments on the three new capital lease financing obligations 
our interest in the real estate holding companies that own the three communities is accounted for using the cost method 
minority interest expense  which prior to the transaction included hcpi s interest in the subject communities  was reduced 
the net impact of these two items is expected to be a positive increase in pre tax income of approximately million per quarter approximately million per year 
lease related expenses increased approximately million per quarter approximately million per year  which includes o lease expense on the operating lease of million per quarter  which is partially offset by the amortization of the million of deferred gain of million per quarter 
o increased depreciation of million per quarter on the assets of the three capital lease financing communities due to the decrease in depreciable life 
in addition  as a result of the july transaction  during the third quarter of  we recorded charges of approximately million  which included the write off of million of unamortized financing costs in interest expense relating to the early prepayment of the mezzanine loan and the other debt repaid in the transaction 
general and administrative expense of approximately million reflecting transaction related costs 
a current tax expense of approximately million related to the taxable gain  after full utilization of our operating losses  on the sale of our interest in the four communities 
historic highlights prior to the late s  we exclusively owned and operated retirement centers 
our expansion into the assisted living market during the late s with most of our free standing assisted living communities opening during and resulted in large amounts of new debt and capital lease financing 
while the assisted living market grew rapidly during this period  an oversupply of new units caused slower than anticipated fill up times for these communities  at lower than anticipated prices 
consequently  many of our free standing assisted living communities incurred large start up losses beginning in  and took longer than anticipated to reach stabilized occupancy levels 
twenty one of our free standing assisted living communities had occupancy rates of or better at december  the free standing assisted living segment produced a positive community operating contribution for  and greatly increased operating contribution during and we expect this trend to continue 
during  we had over million of current debt maturities largely associated with the development and financing of our free standing assisted living communities which were maturing at a time when the free standing assisted living communities were still filling up and producing weak operating results 
in addition  the assisted living industry in general  was in a weakened financial condition 
as a result  our access to mortgage refinancings and other capital sources during this period was limited 
in order to address our maturities  we successfully completed a refinancing plan that included mortgage refinancings  a series of sale leaseback transactions predominately on assisted living properties then in fill up stage  an exchange offer for our maturing convertible debentures and the mezzanine loan 
as a result of these transactions  we addressed our maturing obligations  but we remained highly leveraged with a substantial amount of debt and lease obligations  including the high cost mezzanine debt 
many of these financing transactions resulted in large gains or losses 
while the losses immediately reduced our reported equity  the gains were largely deferred 
at december   million of gains on various sale leaseback transactions are deferred and are being recognized over the terms of the subject leases 
during and  our operating results improved significantly 
our retirement centers maintained and increased their high occupancy rates  and increased average revenue per unit per month 
our free standing assisted living segment continued its fill up  ending at occupancy  and significantly increasing revenue per unit per month 
as a result  we were able to complete several refinancing transactions during and that completely repaid the high cost mezzanine debt over three years early  and significantly reduced our interest and debt service costs 
during january  we completed a secondary equity offering of  common shares  resulting in approximately million of net proceeds to us 
we used million these proceeds to further reduce certain high cost debt  to acquire a retirement center  and to acquire an assisted living community 
see business recent developments 
we will use the remaining proceeds to acquire certain leased real estate at our communities  and for upcoming expansion and development activity at our communities or for working capital 
highlights of operating results our statements of operations in recent years should be considered in light of the following factors  some of which are likely to influence our future operating results and financial outlook our statements of operations for the three and twelve months ended december  show significant improvement versus prior year 
excluding the million of charges relating to the july  transaction  net losses for the twelve months ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
our statements of operations for the three months ended december  reflected million of net income 
in order to increase net income  we are focusing primarily on improving results in our free standing assisted living and retirement center segments  while controlling our general and administrative costs and reducing our debt service costs 
we plan to increase occupancy in our free standing assisted living community segment and increase revenue per unit  while controlling our operating costs 
we also intend to increase ancillary services and revenue per unit in our retirement center segment  increase occupancy at selected communities  and control our operating costs  including labor  insurance and liability related costs 
we are focusing on increasing our free standing assisted living community operating contribution further primarily by increasing occupancy above the current level  and by increasing revenue per unit through price increases  ancillary services  and the mark to market effect of turnover of units that are at lower rates 
since monthly rates for new residents current market selling rates are generally higher than billing rates for current residents  turnover typically results in significantly increased monthly fees for the new resident 
we believe that  absent unforeseen market or pricing pressures  occupancy increases above should produce high incremental community operating contribution margins for this segment 
the risks to improving occupancy in our free standing assisted living community portfolio are increases in move outs in any period due to health or other reasons  maintaining high quality and service levels  and the development of new unit capacity or renewed price discounting by competitors in our markets  which could make it more difficult to fill vacant units and which could result in lower revenue per unit 
our free standing assisted living communities increased revenue and community operating contribution during  primarily as a result of a increase in revenue per unit  as well as an increase in ending occupancy from as of december   to as of december  the increased revenue per unit in our free standing assisted living communities resulted primarily from selling rate increases  reduced discounting  and turnover of units resulting in new residents paying higher current market rates 
in addition  our residency agreements provide for annual rate increases 
the increased amount of ancillary services  including therapy services  also contributed to the increased revenue per unit 
our free standing assisted living community incremental increase in operating contribution as a percentage of revenue increase was for the year ended december  versus the twelve months ended december  our free standing assisted living community operating contribution per unit per month increased during  to per unit per month 
we are also focused on increasing the revenues and operating contribution of our retirement centers 
revenue per unit increases at our retirement centers resulted primarily from increases in selling rates  increased therapy and ancillary service billings  as well as annual billing rate increases to existing residents typically to under most resident agreements 
in addition  a significant component of the average revenue per unit increase stems from the mark to market effect of resident turnover 
since monthly rates for new residents current market selling rates are generally higher than billing rates for current residents since annual increases to billing rates are typically capped in resident agreements  turnover typically results in significantly increased monthly fees for the new resident 
this mark to market increase is generally more significant in entrance fee communities due to much longer average length of stay ten or more years 
retirement center community operating contribution increased significantly over the prior year quarter  primarily as a result of increased revenue per unit and occupancy increases 
revenues were up for the year ended december  versus the prior year  and community operating expenses were up  resulting in operating margins increasing from to for our largest segment 
our retirement center operating contribution per unit per month increased during  to  per unit per month 
segment results we operate in three business segments retirement centers  free standing assisted living communities  and management services 
the following table presents the number  total unit capacity and total ending and average occupancy percentages of our communities by operating segment at december   and number of communities total ending capacity december  ending occupancy ending occupied units december  average occupancy average occupied units year ended december  retirement centers free standing als management services total we measure the performance of our three business segments  in part  based upon the operating contribution produced by these business segments 
we compute operating contribution by deducting the operating expenses associated with a segment from the revenues produced by that segment

excludes two free standing assisted living communities we own through joint ventures 
these joint ventures are not included in the consolidated free standing assisted living segment results since we do not own a majority interest 
the net results of these joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are included in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  retirement centers revenue retirement center revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  which was comprised of million from increased occupancy due to the august lease of two previously managed communities  which increased revenues by million  offset by a million decrease in revenues resulting from the september sale manageback of a previously owned retirement center 
we increased average occupancy in retirement centers by units when comparing december  with december  the unit increase includes the partial year impact of converting the two previously managed retirement centers to a lease during august  which was offset by a decrease resulting from the sale manageback of a retirement center during september million from other increases in occupancy 
occupancy of the retirement center segment at december  was 
any occupancy gains above this level should produce significant incremental operating contributions 
we are focused on maintaining this high level of occupancy across the portfolio  and making incremental occupancy gains at selected communities with below average occupancy levels for our retirement centers 
million from increased revenue per occupied unit 
this increase is comprised primarily of selling rate increases and increased ancillary services provided to residents including an million increase in therapy services and a million increase in entrance fee income 
rate increases include the impact of increased medicare reimbursement rates for skilled nursing and therapy services  the mark to market effect from turnover of residents reselling units at higher current selling rates and annual increases in monthly service fees from existing residents 
we expect that selling rates to new residents will generally continue to increase during  absent an adverse change in market conditions 
community operating expenses retirement center community operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  which was comprised of million increase due to the august lease of two previously managed communities  which increased expenses by million  offset by the september sale manageback of a previously owned retirement center  which decreased expenses million 
million of increased labor and related costs 
this increase is primarily a result of wage rate increases for associates and additional staffing costs  including approximately million supporting the growth of our therapy services program 
although wage rates of associates are expected to increase each year  we do not expect significant changes in staffing levels in our retirement center segment  other than to support community expansions or the growth of ancillary programs such as therapy services 
million of other year to year cost increases 
this includes increases in operating expenses such as utilities  property taxes  marketing  food  ancillary costs and other property related costs 
community operating contribution retirement center operating contribution was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the operating contribution margin increased from at december  to at december   an increase of percentage points 
the increased operating contribution margin in primarily relates to continued operational improvements throughout the retirement center segment resulting from increased occupancy and revenue per occupied unit including continued growth of the therapy services program  and control of community operating expenses including labor  employee benefits and insurance related costs 
free standing assisted living communities revenue free standing assisted living community revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  which was comprised of million from increased revenue per occupied unit 
this increase includes the impact of price increases  reduced discounting and promotional allowances  and the mark to market effect from turnover of residents reselling units at higher current rates  and includes million related to increased revenues from therapy services 
we will be focused on increasing revenue per occupied unit  subject to market constraints  through price increases  as well as the mark to market turnover of residents with prior discounted rates  and an increase in ancillary services such as therapy 
million from increased occupancy 
occupancy increased from at december  to at december   an increase of percentage points 
we are focused on continuing to increase the occupancy in the free standing assisted living communities  and believe that over the long term  this segment of the industry should be able to achieve average occupancy levels at or near those achieved in our retirement center segment 
we are focused on increasing our number of move ins  increasing average length of stay  and expanding our marketing efforts and sales training in order to increase occupancy 
these amounts exclude the revenue and occupancy for two free standing assisted living communities owned through unconsolidated joint ventures 
community operating expenses free standing assisted living community operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  which was comprised of million of additional labor and labor related costs 
this increase is primarily a result of wage rate increases for associates and additional staffing costs of approximately million supporting the growth of our therapy services programs 
we do not expect significant increases in staffing levels in our free standing assisted living communities as occupancy levels increase over the current  since most of our communities are nearly fully staffed at current occupancy levels 
however  growth of ancillary revenue programs such as therapy may require additional staff to support incremental activity 
as a result of higher recruiting and retention costs of qualified personnel  we expect increased wage rates each year  subject to labor market conditions 
million of other net cost increases 
this includes increased community overhead costs  food costs and various other cost increases 
community operating contribution free standing assisted living community operating contribution was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
for the year ended december  and  respectively  the operating contribution margin increased from to  an increase of percentage points 
the increased margin primarily relates to strong increases in revenue per occupied unit and some occupancy increases  coupled with control of community operating expenses 
the incremental increase in operating contribution as a percentage of revenue increase was for the year ended december  versus december  we believe that  absent unforeseen cost pressures  revenue increases resulting from occupancy increases should continue to produce high incremental community operating contribution margins as a percentage of sales increase for this segment 
management services 
management services revenues and operating contribution were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase results from the september sale manageback of a previously owned retirement center 
during the year ended december   we consolidated a managed community freedom square in accordance with new accounting literature and have restated all prior periods presented to conform to this presentation 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
overall costs related to our insurance coverages  including claim reserves for general and professional liability  increased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  additional general and administrative costs were incurred during increased audit and consulting costs related to compliance with sarbanes oxley during amounted to approximately million during the year 
the year ended december  also included million of costs associated with a restricted stock grant to certain of our executive officers 
approximately million of the increase was the result of costs incurred in conjunction with the july sale leaseback transaction  offset by approximately million of costs incurred during the year ended december  related to the sale leaseback transactions 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of total consolidated revenues was for the years ended december  and we believe that measuring general and administrative expense as a percentage of total consolidated revenues and combined revenues including unconsolidated managed revenues provides insight as to the level of our overhead in relation to our total operating activities including those that relate to management services 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of total combined revenues was and for the year ended december  and  respectively  calculated as follows year ended december  total consolidated revenues   revenues of unconsolidated managed communities   less management fees   total combined revenue   total general and administrative expense   general and administrative expense as a of total consolidated revenues general and administrative expense as a of total combined revenue lease expense 
lease expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
as a result of sale leaseback transactions completed in  a retirement center is currently operated pursuant to operating leases previously owned  and two retirement centers are currently capital lease financing obligations previously owned 
lease expense increased million as a result of these transactions 
these increases were offset by approximately million of increased amortization of deferred gain on sale 
as a result of the sale leaseback transactions completed in in which five owned or managed retirement centers became leased properties  lease expense in increased by million  when compared to as a result of the sale manage back transaction completed in in which a leased a retirement center became managed  lease expense in decreased by million when compared to net lease expense for the year ended december  was million  which includes current lease payments of million  plus straight line accruals for future lease escalators of million  net of the amortization of the deferred gain from prior sale leasebacks of million 
as a result of the expiration of contingent earn outs included in lease agreements for two free standing assisted living communities  these leases are accounted for as operating leases as of december  versus capital lease financing obligation treatment for these leases in prior periods 
lease expense for the two free standing assisted living communities is expected to be approximately million a quarter 
as of december   we had operating leases for of our communities  including retirement centers and free standing assisted living communities 
our lease expense  including the two free standing assisted living communities added during the fourth quarter  is expected to approximate million per quarter  absent any subsequent refinancing or transactional activity depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
approximately million of the increase was related to the july transaction which reduced the depreciable asset lives to the ten year initial lease term for two retirement centers and one free standing assisted living community 
in addition  depreciation expense increased million related to and depreciation on assets previously held for sale 
these increases are offset by million decrease of depreciation expense related to the sale lease back of three retirement centers and the sale of an additional retirement center 
depreciation expense for the quarter ended december  was million and is expected to remain at approximately that amount per quarter  absent any subsequent refinancing or transactional activity 
amortization of leasehold acquisition costs 
amortization of leasehold acquisition costs was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was related to the august lease of two retirement centers that we previously managed  which increased leasehold acquisition costs by million  adjusted by a million reduction in prior leasehold acquisition costs  for a net increase of million 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to our million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was primarily the result of in connection with the sale leaseback transactions completed in july  we repaid the remaining million balance of the mezzanine loan  and million of first mortgage debt 
these transactions decreased the year ended december  interest expense compared to the year ended december  interest expense by approximately million 
this decrease was offset by the write off of million of unamortized financing costs relating to the early prepayment of the debt repaid in the transaction 
as a result of the sale leaseback transactions completed in september  we repaid million of first mortgage debt  and million of the mezzanine loan 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million 
this amount includes million of interest expense on debt repaid or refinanced during interest expense is expected to approximate a quarterly amount of million  before the impact of our january equity offering or any subsequent refinancing or transactional activity  or an increase in the interest rates of our variable rate debt 
other income expense 
interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest income may vary from these amounts in the future based on cash and restricted cash balances  as well as changes in interest rates 
gain on the sale of assets for the year ended december  was million 
this gain resulted from the sale manageback of a retirement center in september income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was an expense of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  these taxes are largely the result of tax on gains recognized in connection with the july and september sale and sale leaseback transactions 
we have a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately million as of december   which increased by approximately million during calendar year as a result of our reported losses in the past several years  we do not meet the more likely than not recoverability criteria necessary to currently recognize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  except for those assets which will be recovered through known reversals of deferred tax liabilities 
we will continue to assess our ability to generate sufficient taxable income from positive income and other factors during future periods in which the deferred tax assets may be utilized 
if we continue to improve our reported and expected results  we expect that we will meet the more likely than not recoverability criteria in the future 
upon meeting that criteria  we will reduce or eliminate our valuation allowance of approximately million against deferred tax assets  resulting in a significant reduction of tax expense or recording tax benefit in such period  which will result in a corresponding increase to net income and shareholders equity 
minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries  net of tax 
minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries  net of tax  was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this amount was attributable to the hcpi equity investment made during september  as well as the freedom square management agreement consolidated in accordance with new accounting literature see note to our consolidated financial statements 
a million reduction in minority interest was attributable to the july sale leaseback in which we sold a substantial majority of our interest in two retirement centers and one free standing assisted living community while retaining a interest in those three communities 
offsetting this decrease is an increase of million  which was attributable to increased entrance fee sales for the year ended december  versus december  at freedom square 
net loss 
we experienced a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  for the year ended december  year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the highlights of our results of operations were as follows our free standing assisted living communities increased revenue and community operating contribution  primarily as a result of a increase in revenue per unit  as well as an increase in occupancy from to during the period from december to december the increased revenue per unit in free standing assisted living communities resulted primarily from selling rate increases  reduced discounting  and turnover of units resulting in new residents paying higher current market rates 
in addition  current resident agreements contain annual rate increases typically to 
the increased amount of ancillary services including therapy services  has also contributed to the increased revenue per unit 
the free standing assisted living community incremental increase in operating contribution as a percentage of revenue increase was for versus retirement center community operating contribution increased significantly over the prior year  primarily as a result of increased revenue per unit and occupancy increases 
revenues were up in versus the prior year  community operating expenses were up  resulting in operating margins increasing from to  for our largest segment 
in september  we completed a refinancing transaction that resulted in the repayment of approximately of our mezzanine loan  reducing the balance at december  to million 
as a result  we replaced a portion of the mezzanine loan with lower cost  longer term leases  reducing our overall cost of capital and partially addressing debt maturities 
while our income statement showed significant improvement in operating income versus the prior year  we continued to incur high costs related to interest and lease obligations  and incurred a net loss of million  despite million of gains on the sale of certain properties 
during the fourth quarter of we reported a net loss of million  which was not affected by significant deferred gains on the sale of properties 
retirement centers revenue retirement center revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  which was comprised of million from increased revenue per occupied unit 
this increase was made up primarily of selling rate increases and increased ancillary services provided to residents including a million increase in therapy services 
rate increases include the impact of increased medicare reimbursement rates for skilled nursing and therapy  the mark to market effect from turnover of residents reselling these units at higher current selling rates and annual increases in monthly service fees from existing residents 
million from increased occupancy 
the year to year increase in average occupancy was units 
this included the partial year impact of converting two communities  which were previously managed  to a lease during august  and the change of a community from owned to managed during september occupancy of the segment at december  was 
million of other net decreases  which was primarily a million decrease from divestitures of certain home health agencies  as well as other decreases 
community operating expenses retirement center community operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  which was comprised of million of labor and related costs 
this increase was primarily a result of wage rate increases for associates  as well as approximately additional associates  and the additional staffing costs of approximately million supporting the growth of the therapy services programs 
million of increased marketing costs 
this increase was a result of expansions at three communities  and additional marketing staff and other expenditures at selected communities 
million of increased utility costs  including significant increases incurred at various communities in texas 
million of other year to year cost increases 
this includes increases in insurance  food  property taxes  and other property related costs 
community operating contribution retirement center operating contribution was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the operating contribution margin increased from in  to in  an increase of percentage points 
the margin of decreased during primarily as a result of larger increases in labor and employee benefit costs  as well as increased insurance and liability related costs 
the increased margin in primarily relates to continued operational improvements throughout the retirement center segment resulting from increased occupancy and revenue per occupied unit including continued growth of the therapy services program  and control of community operating expenses including labor  employee benefits and insurance related costs 
free standing assisted living communities revenue free standing assisted living community revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  which was comprised of million from increased revenue per occupied unit 
this increase included the impact of price increases  reduced discounting and promotional allowances  and the mark to market effect from turnover of residents reselling these units at higher current rates  and includes million related to increased revenues from therapy services 
million from increased occupancy 
occupancy increased from at december  to at december   an increase of 
these amounts are net of the revenue and occupancy for two free standing assisted living communities owned through unconsolidated joint ventures 
community operating expenses free standing assisted living community operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  which was comprised of million of labor and labor related costs 
this increase was primarily a result of wage rate increases for associates and additional staffing costs of approximately million supporting the growth of the therapy services programs 
million of food costs  primarily as a result of increased occupancy 
million of other net cost decreases 
this includes decreased marketing expenses as certain communities reach stabilized occupancy levels  and various other cost decreases 
community operating contribution free standing assisted living operating contribution was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the operating contribution margin increased from in  to in  an increase of percentage points 
the increased margin in primarily related to strong increases in revenue per occupied unit and some occupancy increases  coupled with control of community operating expenses 
the incremental increase in operating contribution as a percentage of revenue increase was for versus management services management services revenues and operating contribution were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily related to various improved operating results at several managed communities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was related to lower consulting and legal costs versus costs incurred during related to consummation of the refinancing transactions  offset by higher administrative costs resulting from expanded compliance and regulatory requirements 
our accruals for costs under the self insured medical plan were reduced in versus  which was partially offset by increased accruals for liability and workers compensation claims 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of total consolidated revenues decreased to for from for  a decrease of percentage points 
we believe that measuring general and administrative expense as a percentage of total consolidated revenues and combined revenues including unconsolidated managed revenues provides insight as to the level of our overhead in relation to our total operating activities including those that relate to management services 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of total combined revenues decreased to from for the year ended december  and  respectively  calculated as follows year ended december  total consolidated revenues   revenues of unconsolidated managed communities   less management fees   total combined revenue   total general and administrative expense   general and administrative expense as a of total consolidated revenues general and administrative expense as a of total combined revenue lease expense 
lease expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the additional lease expense of million recorded during the year ended december   related to residual value guarantees for the termination of certain synthetic leases on various communities 
as of december   we no longer operated any of our communities under synthetic lease structures 
excluding the synthetic lease expense  lease expense increased million as a result of certain sale leaseback transactions completed in and as a result of the sale leaseback transactions completed in september  three additional retirement centers were leased versus owned properties 
net lease expense for the fourth quarter of was million  which includes current lease payments of million  plus accruals for future lease escalators of million  net of the amortization of the deferred gain from prior sale leasebacks of million 
as of december   we had operating leases for of our communities  including retirement centers and free standing assisted living communities 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily related to increased depreciable assets during the second half of mainly due to the addition of assets from leasehold acquisitions  offset by the million reduction in depreciable assets from the september  transactions 
amortization of leasehold acquisition costs 
amortization of leasehold acquisition costs was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the amortization costs included million of accelerated amortization of leasehold acquisition costs related to the termination of synthetic leases 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher average cost of debt as a result of various refinancing transactions completed during these amounts include the deferred interest on the hcpi mezzanine loan 
this mezzanine loan impacts all of  but only the fourth quarter of as a result of the transactions completed in september  we repaid million of first mortgage debt  and million of the mezzanine loan 
at december   the mezzanine loan balance was million 
other income expense 
gain of the sale of assets for the year ended december  was million 
this gain resulted primarily from the sale of a retirement center during september interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to reduced amounts of certificates of deposit and notes receivable balances associated with certain terminated leasing transactions  as well as lower interest rates 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was an expense of million for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december   an increase of million 
these taxes were largely the result of gains recognized with the september sale and sale lease back transactions 
we recorded a valuation allowance against federal and state net operating loss carryovers as well as other deferred tax assets 
minority interest in earning on consolidated subsidiaries  net of tax 
minority interest in earnings on consolidated subsidiaries  net of tax  was million for the year ended december   compared to million of losses for the year ended december  these amounts were attributable to the hcpi equity investment made during september  as well as the freedom square managed community 
net loss 
we experienced a net loss of million  or 
loss per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  for the year ended december  the net loss is net of a gain on sale of assets of million 
the net loss includes the impact of various charges related to the completion of the refinancing plan 
quarterly results the following table presents certain quarterly operating results for each of our last eight fiscal quarters  derived from our unaudited financial statements 
we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a full year or predictive of future periods

see note to our consolidated financial statements 
during the quarter ended september   we recorded million of gain on sale related to the sale of a retirement center 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash from operating activities are the collection of monthly and other billings for providing housing  healthcare services and ancillary services at our communities  the proceeds from the sale of entrance fees  and management fees from the communities we manage for third parties 
these collections are primarily from residents or their families  with coming from various reimbursement programs primarily medicare 
the primary uses of cash for our ongoing operations include the payment of community operating expenses  including labor costs and related benefits  general and administrative costs  lease and interest payments  principal payments required under various debt agreements  refunds due upon termination of entrance fee contracts  working capital requirements  and capital expenditures necessary to maintain our buildings and equipment 
we have substantial payment commitments on our outstanding debt  capital lease and lease financing obligations and operating lease obligations 
as shown in the future cash commitments table below  we have significant payment obligations during the next five years 
these commitments and our plans regarding them are described below we have total debt of million at december  we also guaranty million of third party senior debt in connection with a retirement center and a free standing assisted living community that we operate 
our long term debt payments include recurring principal amortization and other amounts due each year plus various maturities of mortgages and other loans 
we have scheduled debt principal payments of million  including payments of million of maturity payments due during the twelve months ended december  we intend to pay or these amounts as they come due primarily from cash provided by operations 
as of december   we lease of our communities operating leases and leases accounted for as capital lease and lease financing obligations 
we also lease certain equipment 
as a result  we have significant lease payments 
our capital lease and lease financing obligations include payments of million that are due in the twelve months ended december  during the twelve months ending december   we are also obligated to make minimum rental payments of approximately million under long term operating leases 
we intend to pay these lease obligations primarily from cash provided by operations 
see our future cash commitments table below 
our cash needs for debt and lease obligations  including interest payments  will remain a significant cost for the foreseeable future 
in order to further increase our liquidity  we are focusing on increasing our cash flow from operations and reducing our leverage and debt service costs 
we are focused on increasing our cash flow from operations primarily by increasing our occupancy levels and revenue per unit at our communities through periodic selling rate increases and additional ancillary services  while controlling operating expenses and maintaining strong entrance fee sales 
we are continuously exploring opportunities to reduce our leverage and average debt cost by refinancing higher cost debt 
in addition  we plan to reduce our leverage through scheduled amortization of debt and prepayments of certain additional amounts as funds are available 
as of december   we had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash  and million of working capital 
on january   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  including the underwriter s over allotment of  shares 
the shares were priced at 
the net proceeds of the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses  were approximately million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements  capital expenditure requirements  periodic debt service requirements  and lease obligations during the next twelve months 
we may also consider  from time to time  development or acquisition of additional senior living communities or other assets 
we plan to add additional units to our portfolio  primarily through the expansion of our existing retirement center communities 
we currently have expansion projects in various stages of development relating to our communities 
several of these are expected to begin construction during  and would increase our unit capacity over the next several years beginning in 
these projects are expected to be financed through a combination of our cash investment  lessor and lender financing  and entrance fee sale proceeds for certain projects 
we also expect to selectively pursue the development and construction of new senior living communities and potential future acquisitions of senior living communities and businesses engaged in activities that are similar or complementary to our business 
such transactions  if significant  would generally require us to provide a portion of the funding and to arrange separate lease  mortgage or other financing for the remaining cost 
certain development projects may be structured as joint ventures with other third party capital partners 
we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on our income or cash flows in  since of our debt has fixed rates 
there can be no assurances  however  that interest rates will not significantly change and increase our future debt service costs 
as a result of operating losses  we have not incurred significant tax payments in recent years 
taxable gains on various sale leaseback transactions have fully utilized our tax loss carryforwards during  and we expect to be a taxpayer for and future years 
certain of our indebtedness and lease agreements are cross collateralized or cross defaulted 
any default with respect to such obligations could cause our lenders or lessors to declare defaults  accelerate payment obligations or foreclose upon the communities securing such indebtedness or exercise their remedies with respect to such communities  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
certain of our debt instruments and leases contain financial and other covenants  typically related to the specific communities financed or leased 
we believe that projected results from operations and cash flows will be sufficient to satisfy these covenants 
however  there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance with those covenants  or in the event of future non compliance  that our creditors will grant amendments or waivers 
we have primarily used a combination of mortgage financing  capital lease and lease financing  and convertible debentures to finance our cash needs over the past several years 
in the future  subject to our performance and market conditions  we would expect to utilize various types of financing including mortgage financing  capital lease financing  and public debt or equity offerings as well 
tax valuation allowance as of december   we have a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately million 
as a result of our reported losses in the past several years  we do not meet the more likely than not recoverability criteria necessary to currently recognize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  except for those assets which will be recovered through known reversals of deferred tax liabilities 
we will continue to assess our ability to generate sufficient taxable income from positive income and other factors during future periods in which the deferred tax assets may be utilized 
if we continue to improve our reported and expected results  we expect that we will meet the more likely than not recoverability criteria in the future 
upon meeting that criteria  we will reduce or eliminate our valuation allowance of approximately million against deferred tax assets  resulting in a significant reduction of tax expense or recording tax benefit in such period  which will result in a corresponding increase to net income and shareholders equity 
cash flow  investing and financing activity during the year ended december   we experienced a positive net cash flow of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  net cash used by investing activities was million and net cash used by financing activities was million 
our unrestricted cash balance was million as of december   as compared to million as of december  primarily  cash was provided from improved operating results and strong entrance fee sales  and proceeds from refinancing transactions  while cash was used primarily for debt service and lease obligations  debt repayments  capital expenditures and working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an improvement of million  primarily as a result of improved operational results  exclusive of gain on sale of assets  and increased net cash from entrance fee sales and refunds 
net cash from entrance fee sales proceeds from entrance fee sales  less refunds of entrance fee terminations was million for the year ended december   versus million for the year ended december  we are focused on maintaining strong entrance fee sales for  however  given the high occupancy at our existing entrance fee communities  additional growth of entrance fee sales at these communities may become a function of the available inventory of vacant units 
we routinely make capital expenditures to maintain or enhance communities under our control 
our maintenance capital spending is primarily for refurbishing apartments and maintaining the quality of our communities 
capital spending for the year ended december  was million  including million of maintenance capital spending  and million of capital expenditures related to expansion and development activities 
our expected maintenance capital spending is approximately million 
in addition  capital spending on expansion and development activities is expected to increase during net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million of cash used during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we received proceeds of million from issuance of long term debt and million from capital lease financings 
during  we made principal payments on our indebtedness of million  paid million of financing costs and made distributions to minority interest holders of million 
in connection with certain entrance fee communities  we made principal payments under master trust agreements of million during during  we experienced a negative net cash flow of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  net cash used by investing activities was million and net cash used by financing activities was million 
our unrestricted cash balance was million as of december   as compared to million as of december  primarily  cash was provided from improved operating results and strong entrance fee sales  proceeds from refinancing transactions and asset sales  while cash was used primarily for debt service and lease obligations  working capital and capital expenditures 
our net cash used by operating activities of million for  compared to million of cash provided by operating activities for  was primarily a result of improving operational results  and increased net cash from entrance fee sales

guarantees include mortgage debt related to two communities 
the mortgage debt we guarantee relates to a retirement center under a long term operating lease agreement  and to a free standing assisted living community in which we have a joint venture interest 
subsequent to december   we completed several transactions which significantly impact our future cash commitments 
these transactions resulted in the repayment of million of mortgage debt and the acquisition for cash of a free standing assisted living community that we previously leased  which respectively resulted in the reduction of our long term debt and our operating lease obligations 
see business recent developments

critical accounting policies certain critical accounting policies are complex and involve significant judgments by our management  including the use of estimates and assumptions  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
as a result  changes in these estimates and assumptions could significantly affect our financial position or results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition and assumptions at entrance fee communities our six entrance fee communities provide housing and healthcare services through entrance fee agreements with residents 
under certain of these agreements  residents pay an entrance fee upon entering into the contract and are contractually guaranteed certain limited lifecare benefits 
the recognition of entrance fee revenue requires the use of various actuarial estimates 
we recognize this revenue by recording the nonrefundable portion of the residents entrance fees as deferred entrance fee income and amortizing it into revenue using the straight line method over the estimated remaining life expectancy of each resident or couple 
we periodically assesses the reasonableness of these mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions  and measurement of future service obligations 
self insurance liability accruals we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business 
although we maintain general liability and professional malpractice insurance policies for our owned  leased and certain managed communities under a master insurance program  our policy provided for deductibles at amounts varying by state and level of care from million to million  and our policy provides for million deductibles 
as a result  we are self insured for most typical claims 
in addition  we maintain a self insured workers compensation program with excess loss coverage of  per individual claim and a self insured employee medical program with excess loss coverage of  per claim 
we are self insured for amounts below these excess loss coverage amounts 
we review the adequacy of our accruals related to these liabilities on an ongoing basis  using historical claims  third party administrator estimates  consultants  advice from legal counsel and industry loss development factors  and adjust accruals periodically 
estimated costs related to these self insurance programs are accrued based on known claims and projected claims incurred but not yet reported 
subsequent changes in actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated as information is available 
tax valuation allowance we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized 
as of december   we have a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately million 
when we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase shareholder s equity in the period such determination is made 
this determination will be made by considering various factors  including our expected future results  that in our judgment will make it more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
lease accounting we determine whether to account for our leases as either operating  capital  or financing leases depending on the underlying terms 
as of december   we operated of our senior living communities under long term leases operating and capital lease financing obligations 
the determination of this classification is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
our classification criteria is based on estimates regarding the fair value of the leased community  minimum lease payments  our effective cost of funds  the economic life of the community and certain other terms in the lease agreements 
communities under operating leases are accounted for in our statement of operations as lease expense for actual rent paid plus any increases in lease payments considered to be contingent but determinable 
for communities under capital lease and financing obligation arrangements  a liability is established on our balance sheet based on either the present value of the lease payments or the gross proceeds received and a corresponding long term asset is recorded 
lease payments are allocated between principal and interest on the remaining base lease obligation and the capital lease asset is depreciated over the term of the lease 
in addition  we amortize leasehold improvements purchased during the term of the lease over the shorter of their economic life or the lease term 
sale lease back transactions are recorded as capital lease financing obligations when the transactions include a form of continuing involvement  such as purchase options or contingent earn outs 
certain of our leases provide for various additional lease payments  as well as renewal options 
many of our leases contain fixed or formula based rent escalators 
to the extent that there is a high level of certainty that the fixed rate increase under the lease will be met or the formula based escalator is determinable  lease payments are accounted for on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
in addition  we recognize all rent free or rent holiday periods in operating leases on a straight line basis over the lease term  including the rent holiday period 
leasehold acquisition costs at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of leasehold acquisition costs 
the terms of the leasehold interests range from april to august leasehold acquisition costs are amortized principally on a straight line basis over the remaining contractual or expected life of the related lease agreements  if shorter 
accumulated amortization for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
amortization expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
leasehold acquisition costs are assessed for impairment based upon the amount of estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the communities over the remaining lease terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  to represent our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis  using historical payment trends  write off experience  analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables  as well as a review of specific accounts  and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary 
changes in legislation or economic conditions could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances or future allowance considerations 
during and  and  respectively  of our resident and health care revenues were derived from services covered by various third party payor programs  including medicare and medicaid 
billings for services under third party payor programs are recorded net of estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement programs 
retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods or as final settlements are determined 
we accrue contractual or cost related adjustments from medicare or medicaid when assessed without regard to when the assessment is paid or withheld  even if we have not agreed to or are appealing the assessment 
subsequent positive or negative adjustments to these accrued amounts are recorded in net revenues upon final settlement when known 
long lived assets and goodwill as of december   our long lived assets were comprised primarily of million of land  buildings and equipment and million of leasehold acquisition costs 
in accounting for our long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangible assets  we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
beginning january   we accounted for goodwill and other intangible assets under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   we had million of goodwill 
the determination and measurement of an impairment loss under these accounting standards requires the significant use of judgment and estimates 
the determination of fair value of these assets utilizes cash flow projections that assume certain future revenue and cost levels  assumed discount rates based upon current market conditions and other valuation factors  all of which involve the use of significant judgment and estimation 
future events may indicate differences from management s current judgments and estimates which could  in turn  result in impairment 
future events that may result in impairment charges include increases in interest rates  which would impact discount rates  lower than projected occupancy rates and changes in the cost structure of existing communities 
purchase options purchase options to acquire property are recorded at their cost and  upon exercise  are applied to the cost of the property at the time of acquisition 
nonrefundable purchase options are expensed when they expire or when we determine it is no longer probable that the property will be acquired 
we currently have purchase options related to two communities with an aggregate recorded value of million 
based upon variable termination clauses dependent upon occupancy  an option with a recorded value of million will expire in july and an option with a recorded value of million will expire in december we intend to exercise these purchase options 
if it is determined at some future time that we no longer intended to exercise these options  that we will transfer them for other consideration  or that their value was impaired  a loss would be recorded at that time 
recognition of contingent earn outs during and  as part of eight sale lease back transactions with a third party buyer  contingent earn outs of million out of a maximum of million were recorded 
the earn out provisions of the lease agreements specify certain criteria that must be met to receive the earn out consideration 
based upon its review of the earn out criteria  we believe that these estimated amounts are realizable  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management periodically assesses the recoverability of the recorded balances and adjusts the carrying amount to its revised estimate with a corresponding increase or decrease to interest expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this standard revises sfas no 
 apb and related accounting interpretations  and eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method 
we currently uses the intrinsic value method of apb to value stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for stock options as we grant stock options with exercise prices equal to our common stock market price on the date of the grant 
this standard requires the expensing of all stock based compensation  including stock options  using the fair value based method 
if not further revised or required implementation delayed  the effective date of this standard for us will be july  we will elect to expense stock options using the modified prospective transition method prescribed in sfas revised 
the modified prospective transition method requires expense to be recognized for new grants or modifications issued in the period of adoption  plus the current period expense for non vested awards issued prior to the adoption of this standard 
no expense is recognized for awards vested in prior periods 
the weighted average fair value of options granted during  and was  and  respectively 
considering market trends  we expect this average to continue to increase 
at december   we had million unvested options outstanding  of which million vest during the second half of we are currently evaluating the use of various models  as well as the necessary assumptions for calculating the impact from adoption of this standard 
the application of this new guidance will result in an increase in compensation related expense beginning july  in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we have three variable interest entities with which we hold a significant variable interest 
for any variable interest entities that must be consolidated under fin r  the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the variable interest entity initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any differences between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
under this literature  the communities managed for others are consolidated if we have the unilateral ability to conduct the ordinary course of business of the managed communities and are the primary beneficiary of the managed entities operations 
as a result  beginning january   the results of a managed community freedom square were consolidated and we have restated all prior periods presented to conform to this presentation 
the other two managed communities which are variable interest entities  do not meet the fin r consolidation criteria 
off balance sheet arrangements managed communities our management services segment includes five large retirement centers owned by others and operated by us pursuant to multi year management agreements 
under our management agreements for these five communities  we receive management fees as well as reimbursed expense revenues  which represent the reimbursement of certain expenses we incur on behalf of the owners 
two of these communities are retirement center cooperatives that are owned by their residents  and two others are free standing assisted living communities owned by not for profit sponsors 
the remaining retirement center is owned by an unaffiliated third party 
these five communities have approximately  units  representing approximately of the total unit capacity of our communities as of december  we also operate a sixth retirement center  freedom square  under a long term management agreement 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  the operating results of freedom square are included in the consolidated results of our retirement center segment and  accordingly  are not included in our management services segment 
in addition  two free standing assisted living residences we manage are non consolidated and owned by joint ventures 
we own of one of the joint ventures and of the other and have joined with our venture partners in guaranteeing million of first mortgage debt secured by one of the joint venture assets 
related party transactions we place an emphasis on identifying transactions with parties known to be related to ensure that terms of any transactions are equal to the terms that clearly independent third parties would have negotiated in similar transactions 
we believe that each of our related party transactions were consummated on terms no more favorable to the related parties than in arm s length transactions 
during and  we acquired leasehold interests in six free standing als owned by affiliates of john morris  one of our directors 
a million  fixed interest only note  due october  was issued to dr 
morris affiliates 
this note  and certain similar notes  are secured by our interest in a retirement center located in richmond  virginia and a free standing al in san antonio  texas 
the terms of this note and its related security instruments are identical to those issued to certain unaffiliated entities in connection with the simultaneous acquisition of certain other communities 
on january   we repaid this note and two similar notes total repayment of million using proceeds from our january equity offering 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we sheriff  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  owns of maybrook realty  inc  which owns freedom plaza care center fpcc  a bed skilled nursing and bed assisted living center with approximately  square feet of office space subleased to a third party  in peoria  arizona 
freedom plaza care center is on the campus of the freedom plaza of arizona  a community that we lease and operate 
maybrook realty acquired freedom plaza care center on september  from its former owner 
we managed fpcc from october until june and  upon completion of an expansion  entered into a long term operating lease for fpcc 
under the lease  which expires in december  we have one five year renewal option and an option to acquire fpcc at an agreed upon amount 
our total lease payments during  and under this lease were million annually 
for  we recorded approximately million of net income after lease payment from fpcc 
we have exercised our option for the purchase of the real estate interests of fpcc 
the option provides for a fixed purchase price of approximately million to maybrook 
we have also entered into a purchase agreement with the ground lessor to acquire its interest in the property for a purchase price of approximately million 
we expect to simultaneously acquire the real estate interests of both maybrook and the ground lessor in freedom plaza care center and own of the community by march  the total purchase price for these two transactions will be million including million of transaction costs  which is supported by a fair market value appraisal 
we will pay the purchase price with million of cash and the proceeds of an approximately million mortgage loan to be obtained from a commercial bank 
the loan will require principal payments to be made on an year amortization schedule with a maturity of five years  and will bear interest at approximately 
during  we intend to expand fpcc with the addition of approximately assisted living units and dementia beds 
for the twelve months ended december   our operating results for fpcc included revenues of million  operating contribution of million and million of lease expense 
during  the community averaged occupancy 
as a result of these transactions  we expect that our annual lease expense will be reduced by approximately million  which will be offset by an increase in depreciation expense of approximately million and an estimated increase in interest expense of million 
after the completion of the purchase of the real estate interest of fpcc  we have no other related part transactions 
impact of inflation inflation could affect our future revenues and results of operations because of  among other things  our dependence on senior residents  many of whom rely primarily on fixed incomes to pay for our services 
as a result  during inflationary periods  we may not be able to increase resident service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses 
in structuring our fees  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures

risk factors we have substantial debt and operating lease obligations which will require significant amounts of cash each year 
we are highly leveraged with a substantial amount of debt and lease obligations 
our cash needs for our lease and interest payments and principal payments on outstanding debt will remain high for the foreseeable future 
at december   we had long term debt  including current portion  of million 
during the twelve months ending december   we are obligated to pay minimum rental obligations of approximately million under long term operating leases and have current scheduled debt principal payments of million 
at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  million of restricted cash and million of working capital 
for the year ended december   our net cash provided by operations was million 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet required interest  principal  and lease payments in future periods 
any payment or other default with respect to such obligations could cause lenders to and accelerate payment obligations or to foreclose upon our communities securing such indebtedness or  in the case of any of our operating leases  terminate the lease  with a consequent loss of income and asset value to us 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in certain debt instruments and leases  a default by us on one of our obligations could result in default or acceleration of other obligations 
certain of our debt agreements and leases contain various financial and other restrictive covenants  which may limit our flexibility in operating our business 
failure to remain in compliance with the covenants and obligations contained in our debt instruments and leases could have a material adverse impact on us 
we have incurred losses in recent years and may be unable to continue to increase our earnings and cash flow from operations 
we have experienced losses from operations during the past several years 
our ability to increase our earnings and cash flow from operations is contingent on various factors  including our ability to increase the occupancy at our communities  increase revenue per unit through rate increases and additional fees and services  and reduce our debt service costs 
earnings and cash flow from operations may also be negatively impacted by increases in our operating and overhead costs  many of which are beyond our control  unless these increases can be recovered through rate increases 
in addition  changes in amounts reimbursed under programs such as medicare and  to a lesser extent  medicaid may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow from operations in the future 
increasing earnings and cash flow from operations will also be contingent on our ability to derive significant entrance fee sales each year through the remarketing of available units at our entrance fee communities  and to maintain and increase the price level of these units 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase occupancy and revenues  maintain entrance fee sales  and control costs in order to maintain recent levels of profitability and to increase our cash flow from operations and earnings in the future 
our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover claims which may arise against us 
the delivery of personal and health care services entails an inherent risk of liability 
in recent years  participants in the senior living and health care services industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging negligence or related legal theories  many of which involve large claims and result in the incurrence of significant exposure and defense costs 
currently  we maintain general and professional medical malpractice insurance policies for our owned  leased and certain of our managed communities under a master insurance program 
premiums and deductibles for this insurance coverage have risen dramatically recently  particularly during and we are largely self insured for typical claims 
in response to these conditions  we have significantly increased the staff and resources involved in quality assurance  compliance and risk management during the past several years  and have also modified our insurance programs 
we cannot assure you that our current level of accruals will be adequate to cover the actual liabilities that we may ultimately incur 
we also cannot assure you that a claim in excess of our insurance coverage limits will not arise 
a claim against us that is not covered by  or is in excess of  our coverage limits could have a material adverse effect upon us 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future or that  if such insurance is available  it will be available on acceptable terms 
we may be adversely affected by the limited availability of management  nursing and other personnel for our communities and by increased labor costs 
we compete with other providers of senior living and health care services with respect to attracting and retaining qualified management personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of our communities and skilled technical personnel responsible for providing resident care and therapy services 
in certain markets  a shortage of nurses  therapists or trained personnel has required us to enhance our wage and benefits package in order to compete in the hiring and retention of such personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel 
we are also heavily dependent on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled associates in each of the markets in which we operate 
at times  we have experienced a competitive labor market  periodic shortages of qualified workers in certain markets  and wage rate increases for certain of our associates 
we cannot be sure that our labor costs will not increase  or that  if they do increase  they can be matched by corresponding increases in rates charged to residents 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified management and staff personnel  control our labor costs  or pass on increased labor costs to residents through rate increases  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we may be adversely affected by rising interest rates 
future indebtedness  from commercial banks or otherwise  and lease obligations  including those related to communities leased from reits real estate investment trusts  are expected to be based on interest rates prevailing at the time such debt and lease arrangements are obtained 
as of december   we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding 
increases in prevailing interest rates would increase our interest obligations with respect to a substantial portion of our variable rate debt  and would likely increase our interest and lease payment obligations on our future indebtedness and leases 
an increase in prevailing interest rates  if material  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may be unable to refinance debt obligations on acceptable terms 
we may need to refinance certain future debt maturities as they come due 
our ability to refinance debt obligations may be impacted by our operational results  industry and economic conditions  capital market conditions  and other factors that may not be within our control 
our inability to refinance various debt maturities as they come due in future years on acceptable terms could have an adverse impact on us and our financial condition 
if we are unable to expand our communities in accordance with our plans  our anticipated revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are currently working on projects that will expand several of our existing senior living communities over the next several years  and develop certain new senior living communities 
these projects are in various stages of development and are subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
such factors include the necessity of arranging separate leases  mortgage loans or other financings to provide the capital required to complete these projects  difficulties or delays in obtaining zoning  land use  building  occupancy  licensing  certificate of need and other required governmental permits and approvals  failure to complete construction of the projects on budget and on schedule  failure of third party contractors and subcontractors to perform under their contracts  shortages of labor or materials that could delay projects or make them more expensive  adverse weather conditions that could delay completion of projects  increased costs resulting from general economic conditions or increases in the cost of materials  and increased costs as a result of changes in laws and regulations 
we cannot assure you that we will elect to undertake or complete all of our proposed expansion and development projects  or that we will not experience delays in completing those projects 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs prior to achieving stabilized occupancy for each such project and cannot assure you that these costs will not be greater than we have anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that any of our development projects will be economically successful 
our failure to achieve our expansion and development plans could adversely impact our growth objectives  and our anticipated revenues and results of operation 
the senior living industry is very competitive and has been subject to periodic oversupply conditions  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  earnings and expansion plans 
the senior living industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other companies providing independent living  assisted living  skilled nursing  therapy and other similar services and care alternatives 
we expect that there will be competition from existing competitors and new market entrants  some of whom may have substantially greater financial resources than us 
in addition  some of our competitors operate on a not for profit basis or as charitable organizations and have the ability to finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis or through the receipt of charitable contributions  neither of which is available to us 
furthermore  if the development of new senior living communities outpaces the demand for those communities in the markets in which we have senior living communities  those markets may become saturated or over built 
regulation of the independent and assisted living industry  which represents a substantial portion of our senior living services  currently is not substantial and does not represent a significant barrier to entry 
consequently  the development of new senior living communities could outpace demand 
increased competition for residents could also require us to undertake unbudgeted capital improvements or to lower our rates 
an oversupply of senior living communities in our markets or increased competition could adversely affect our business and results of operation 
we may be adversely affected by the loss of our key officers or associates 
we rely upon the services of our executive officers 
the loss of our executive officers and the inability to attract and retain qualified management personnel could affect our ability to manage our business and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by the termination of residency agreements with our independent living residents 
our residency agreements with our independent living residents other than entrance fee contracts are generally for a term of one year terminable by the resident upon to days written notice 
although most residents remain for many years  we do not contract with residents for longer periods of time 
if a large number of residents elected to terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time  our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon attracting residents who have sufficient resources to pay for our services 
circumstances that adversely affect the ability of our residents to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on us 
approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  were attributable to private pay sources 
we expect to continue to rely primarily on the ability of residents to pay for our services from their personal or family financial resources and long term care insurance 
future economic or investment market conditions or other circumstances that adversely affect the ability of seniors to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are susceptible to risks associated with the lifecare benefits that we offer the residents of our lifecare entrance fee communities 
we operate six lifecare entrance fee communities that offer residents a limited lifecare benefit 
residents of these communities pay an upfront entrance fee upon occupancy  of which a portion is generally refundable  with an additional monthly service fee while living in the community 
this limited lifecare benefit is typically a a certain number of free days in the community s health center during the resident s lifetime  b a discounted rate for such services  or c a combination of the two 
the lifecare benefit varies based upon the extent to which the resident s entrance fee is refundable 
the pricing of entrance fees  refundability provisions  monthly service fees  and lifecare benefits are determined utilizing actuarial projections of the expected morbidity and mortality of the resident population 
in the event the entrance fees and monthly service payments established for our communities are not sufficient to cover the cost of lifecare benefits granted to residents  the results of operations and financial condition of these communities could be adversely affected 
residents of these entrance fee communities are guaranteed a living unit and nursing care at the community during their lifetime  even if the resident exhausts his or her financial resources and becomes unable to satisfy his or her obligations to the community 
in addition  in the event a resident requires nursing care and there is insufficient capacity for the resident in the nursing facility at the community where the resident lives  the community must contract with a third party to provide such care 
although we screen potential residents to ensure that they have adequate assets  income  and reimbursements from government programs and third parties to pay their obligations to our communities during their lifetime  we cannot assure you that such assets  income  and reimbursements will be sufficient in all cases 
if insufficient  we have rights of set off against the refundable portions of the residents deposits  and would also seek available reimbursement under medicaid or other available programs 
to the extent that the financial resources of some of the residents are not sufficient to pay for the cost of facilities and services provided to them  or in the event that our communities must pay third parties to provide nursing care to residents of our communities  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we are susceptible to risks associated with the concentration of our facilities in certain geographic areas 
part of our business strategy is to own  lease or manage senior living communities in concentrated geographic service areas 
we have a large concentration of communities in florida  texas  arizona and colorado  among other areas 
accordingly  our operating results may be adversely affected by various regional and local factors  including economic conditions  real estate market conditions  competitive conditions  weather conditions and applicable laws and regulations 
we rely on reimbursement from governmental programs for a portion of our revenues  and we cannot assure you that reimbursement levels will not decrease in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
for the year ended december   we derived of our revenues from medicare and from medicaid 
there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that limit payments to healthcare providers in the future 
changes in the reimbursement policies of the medicare and medicaid programs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
certain per person annual limits on therapy services  which were temporarily effective beginning in september and would have had an adverse effect on our therapy services business  have been deferred until october if re initiated  those limits could negatively affect our therapy services business 
we are susceptible to risks associated with government regulation of the healthcare industry and the burdens of compliance with such regulations 
federal and state governments regulate various aspects of our business 
the development and operation of senior living communities and the provision of health care services are subject to federal  state  and local licensure  certification  and inspection laws 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement  the imposition of fines  temporary suspension of admission of new patients  restrictions on operating or marketing entrance fee communities  suspension or decertification from medicare  medicaid  or other state or federal reimbursement programs  restrictions on our ability to acquire new communities or expand existing communities  or revocation of a community s license 
we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to penalties in the future  or that federal  state  or local governments will not impose restrictions on our activities that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
federal and state anti remuneration laws  such as anti kickback laws  govern some financial arrangements among health care providers and others who may be in a position to refer or recommend patients to those providers 
these laws prohibit  among other things  some direct and indirect payments that are intended to induce the referral of patients to  the arranging for services by  or the recommending of a particular provider of health care items or services 
federal anti kickback laws have been broadly interpreted to apply to some contractual relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral 
similar state laws vary  are sometimes vague  and seldom have been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies 
violation of these laws can result in loss of licensure  substantial civil and criminal penalties and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from participation in medicare and medicaid programs 
there can be no assurance that those laws will be interpreted in a manner consistent with our practices 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  among other things  established standards for the use of and access to health information 
known as the administrative simplification requirements  these provisions  as implemented by regulations published by the united states department of health and human services  established among other things  standards for the security and privacy of health information 
additionally  the rules provide for the use of uniform standard codes for electronic transactions and require the use of uniform employer identification codes 
penalties for violations can range from civil fines to criminal sanctions for the most serious offenses 
compliance with the rules was phased in beginning in october and extends until april these rules are complicated  and there are still a number of unanswered questions with respect to the extent and manner in which the hipaa rules apply to businesses such as those operated by us 
we are subject to risks associated with complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are subject to various regulatory requirements  including the sarbanes oxley act of under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  beginning with our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   our management is required to furnish a report regarding its internal controls over financial reporting 
we have implemented processes documenting and evaluating our system of internal controls 
complying with these new requirements is extremely expensive  time consuming  and subject to ongoing regulatory change 
if  in the future  management identifies one or more material weaknesses  or our auditors are unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  it could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports  adversely affect our stock price and or subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value of the debt  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
generally we do not prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity without penalty 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
at december   we have million of variable rate debt 
each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  since of our debt has fixed rates 
there can be no assurances  however  that interest rates will not significantly change and materially affect the company 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution to manage its exposure 
the swap involves the receipt of a fixed interest rate payment in exchange for the payment of a variable rate interest payment without exchanging the notional principal amount 
receipts on the agreement are recorded as a reduction to interest expense 
under the agreement  we receive a fixed rate of on the million of debt  and pays a floating rate stated by the swap agreement based upon libor and a foreign currency index with a maximum rate of
