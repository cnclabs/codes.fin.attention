proved developed reserves 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery should be included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved 
proved reserves 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil  gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes i that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas oil and or oil water contacts  if any  and ii the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled  but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data 
in the absence of information on fluid contacts  the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir 
reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project  or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based 
estimates of proved reserves do not include i oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as indicated additional reserves  ii oil  gas  and natural gas liquids  the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology  reservoir characteristics  or economic factors  iii oil  gas  and natural gas liquids  that may occur in undrilled prospects  and iv oil  gas  and natural gas liquids  that may be recovered from oil shales  coal  gilsonite and other such sources 
proved reserve additions 
the sum of additions to proved reserves from extensions  discoveries  improved recovery  acquisitions and revisions of previous estimates 
proved undeveloped reserves 
proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled 
proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation 
under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir 
reserve additions 
changes in proved reserves due to revisions of previous estimates  extensions  discoveries  improved recovery and other additions and purchases of reserves in place 

table of contents reserve life 
a measure of the productive life of an oil and gas property or a group of properties  expressed in years 
reserve life is calculated by dividing proved reserve volumes at year end by production for that year 
royalty 
an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage or of the proceeds of the sale thereof  but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage 
royalties may be either landowner s royalties  which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted  or overriding royalties  which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner 
standardized measure 
the present value  discounted at per year  of estimated future net revenues from the production of proved reserves  computed by applying sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and held constant throughout the productive life of the reserves except for consideration of price changes to the extent provided by contractual arrangements  and deducting the estimated future costs to be incurred in developing  producing and abandoning the proved reserves computed based on current costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
future income taxes are calculated by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rate to pre tax future net cash flows  net of the tax basis of the properties involved and utilization of available tax carryforwards related to oil and gas operations

items and business and properties 
general we are an independent oil and gas company primarily engaged in the activities of acquiring  developing  exploiting  exploring and producing oil and gas properties in the united states 
we own oil and gas properties in five states with principal operations in the los angeles and san joaquin basins onshore california  the santa maria basin offshore california the gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana  including the gulf of mexico  the east texas basin in east texas and north louisiana  and the val verde portion of the greater permian basin in texas 
assets in our principal focus areas include mature properties with long lived reserves and significant development and exploitation opportunities as well as newer properties with development  exploitation and exploration potential 
we have historically hedged portions of our oil and gas production to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 

table of contents acquisition of nuevo energy company on may  we acquired nuevo energy company nuevo in a stock for stock transaction 
in the acquisition  each outstanding share of nuevo common stock was converted into shares of pxp common stock and nuevo became our wholly owned subsidiary 
at the closing of this transaction we issued million additional pxp common shares and assumed million in net debt and million of term convertible securities  series a  or tecons 
the transaction is expected to qualify as a tax free reorganization under section a of the internal revenue code and to be tax free to our stockholders and to be tax free for the stock portion of the consideration received by nuevo stockholders 
we have accounted for the transaction as a purchase of nuevo under purchase accounting rules and we continue to use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
in connection with our acquisition of nuevo we completed a series of transactions to refinance a portion of our and all of nuevo s outstanding debt the recapitalization transactions 
the recapitalization transactions included amendments to our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes  our issuance of million of senior notes due  a cash tender offer for nuevo s outstanding million of senior subordinated notes  the redemption of the tecons and the termination of nuevo s credit facility 
all of these transactions were successfully completed on or before june  see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities 
acquisition of tec energy corporation on june   we acquired tec energy corporation tec for approximately million in cash and common stock plus million to retire tec s outstanding debt 
prior to the acquisition  tec was engaged in the upstream activities of acquiring  exploiting  developing and producing oil and gas in east texas and the gulf coast region  both onshore and in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
in the transaction each tec common share was converted into of a share of our common stock and in cash 
in connection with the merger  we paid cash consideration to the tec common shareholders of approximately million and issued million shares 
in addition  we paid cash consideration of million and issued million common shares to redeem outstanding warrants 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded by the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes and amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
we have accounted for the acquisition of tec under purchase accounting rules effective june  acquisition of oil and gas properties we have entered into an agreement to acquire certain california producing oil and gas properties from a private company for million 
the properties  which currently produce approximately  boe per day  are primarily located in the los angeles basin of onshore california with some smaller properties located in adjacent ventura county 
the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of  subject to customary closing conditions 
the acquisition will be financed under our existing credit facility 
oil and gas reserves we had estimated proved reserves of mmboe as of december   of which was comprised of oil and was proved developed 
we have a total proved reserve life of over years and a proved developed reserve life of over years 
we believe our long lived  low production decline reserve base combined with our active hedging strategy should provide us with relatively stable and recurring cash flow 
as of december  and based on year end spot market prices of per bbl of oil and per mmbtu of gas  as adjusted for area and quality differentials  our reserves had a pv of billion and a standardized measure of billion 

table of contents the following table sets forth information with respect to our oil and gas properties as of and for the year ended december  dollars in millions onshore california offshore california other total proved reserves mmboe percent oil proved developed reserves mmboe production mmboe pv standardized measure based on year end spot market prices of per bbl of oil and per mmbtu of gas as adjusted for area and quality differentials 
pv represents the standardized measure before deducting estimated future income taxes 
estimated future income taxes are calculated on a combined basis using the statutory income tax rate  accordingly  the standardized measure is presented in total only 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our reserves based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum consulting firms of netherland  sewell associates  inc in and netherland  sewell associates  inc and ryder scott company in and the reserve volumes and values were determined under the method prescribed by the sec  which requires the application of year end prices for each year  held constant throughout the projected reserve life

our year end pv and standardized measure include future development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves of million in  million in and million in based on price in effect at year end with adjustments based on location and quality 
the market price for california crude oil differs from the established market indices due primarily to the higher transportation and refining costs associated with heavy oil 
at the end of the basis differentials for california crude oil had widened significantly from prior years end 
as a result  the difference between the year end spot market price and our average year end realized price for is significantly greater than in and a measure of the productive life of an oil and gas property or a group of properties  expressed in years 
reserve life is calculated by dividing proved reserve volumes at year end by production for that year 
and are based on annualized fourth quarter production to reflect the effect of the nuevo and tec acquisitions and the sale of certain producing properties 

table of contents during the three year period ended december  we participated in exploratory wells  of which were successful  and development wells  of which were successful 
during this period  we incurred aggregate oil and gas acquisition  exploitation  development and exploration costs of billion  approximately of which was for acquisition  exploitation and development activities 
during this period proved reserve additions totaled mmboe 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves  and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
many of the factors that impact these estimates are beyond our control 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree speculative  the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and cash flows based upon the same available data 
therefore  the pv shown above represents estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties 
in accordance with sec guidelines  the reserve engineers estimates of future net revenues from our properties  and the present value of the properties  are made using oil and gas sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties  except where the guidelines permit alternate treatment  including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations but excluding the effect of any hedges we have in place 
historically  the prices for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
since december  we have not filed any estimates of total net proved oil or gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 
exploitation  development and exploration we expect to continue our reserve and production growth through the exploitation and development of our existing inventory of projects in each of our primary operating areas 
to complement the exploitation and development activities  we expect to continue to expand on our success in exploratory drilling by taking advantage of our exploratory projects in south louisiana  texas and the gulf of mexico 
to implement the plans  we will focus on allocating investment capital prudently after rigorous evaluation  optimizing production practices  realigning and expanding injection processes  performing stimulations  recompletions  artificial lift upgrades and other operating margin and reserve enhancements  focusing geophysical and geological talent  employing modern seismic applications  establishing land and prospect inventory practices to reduce costs  and using new technology applications in drilling and completion practices 
by implementing our exploitation  development and exploration plan  we seek to increase cash flows and enhance the value of our asset base 
in doing so  we add to and enhance our proved 
table of contents reserves 
during the three year period ended december  our additions to proved reserves  excluding reserves added as a result of acquisition activities  totaled mmboe 
during this period we incurred aggregate oil and gas exploitation  development and exploration costs of million 
the company has a million capital budget for approximately of the budget is expected to be spent on california onshore projects and is expected to be spent offshore california 
approximately is expected to be spent in the gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana and includes expected participation in new prospect areas in the gulf of mexico 
the remainder of the budget is expected to be spent in the east texas basin and north louisiana and the permian basin in west texas 
approximately of the budget is allocated toward reserve exploitation  development drilling and maintenance while is allocated for exploration activities 
the capital budget includes estimated capitalized general and administrative and interest expense of million 
description of properties los angeles and san joaquin basins in california la basin we essentially hold a working interest in our la basin properties  including interests in the montebello  inglewood and inglewood satellite fields  and operate approximately production and waterflood injection wells in the fields 
the la basin properties are characterized by lighter crude to degree api  wells from  feet to over  feet at our deep inglewood project and include both primary production and waterfloods 
seismic technology is being utilized to further evaluate the unproved reserves in our la basin properties and enhance development of proved undeveloped reserves conventional d seismic at the inglewood field and innovative  passive seismic at one of the inglewood satellite fields 
interpretation of the inglewood d data was initiated in and completed in january and drilling in the deep inglewood project started in february at the end of february  wells had been drilled and are on line producing approximately  boe per day 
three wells are being completed and two additional wells are drilling 
this is the first application of d seismic technology for exploitation of an onshore la basin oil field 
we also own approximately acres of surface fee land in the montebello field 
we are currently in the process of seeking entitlements from the relevant regulatory agencies to enable residential and commercial real estate development on our fee lands as the montebello field continues to mature 
in  we spent million on capital projects in the la basin 
the inglewood field accounted for million or of the capital associated with la basin projects 
our net average daily production from our la basin properties in the fourth quarter of was mboe per day 
san joaquin basin we hold interests in the cymric  midway sunset  south belridge  buena vista hills and various other fields in the san joaquin basin 
our san joaquin properties are generally characterized by heavier oil to degree api and shallow wells generally less than  feet that require cyclic and continuous thermal stimulation 
these properties also produce lesser amounts of lighter oil and natural gas under primary recovery 
in  we spent million on capital projects in the san joaquin basin and drilled wells 
in the south belridge field we spent million and drilled wells  in the cymric field we spent million and drilled wells  in the midway sunset field we spent million and drilled wells and in the other fields we spent million and drilled two wells 
our net average daily production from our san joaquin basin properties in the fourth quarter of was mboe per day 

table of contents other onshore california we hold a working interest net revenue interest in the arroyo grande field located in san luis obispo county  california 
we also have surface and related development rights to approximately  acres net to our interest included in the  acre producing unit 
the field is primarily under continuous steam injection 
we have drilled wells to downsize the injection patterns in the currently developed area from five acres to one and a quarter acres to accelerate recoveries  and realigned steam injection within these areas to increase the efficiency of the recovery process 
total proved reserves in arroyo grande field were mmboe at december  with mmboe proved undeveloped which represents approximately of our total proved undeveloped reserves 
in we began final planning  engineering  and permitting for the installation of a reverse osmosis water treatment plant and water out take pipeline needed to remove water from the producing reservoir and increase operating efficiency 
we expect to install those facilities during and with completion anticipated in mid to late during we will continue with an active program of side track drilling existing wells  converting existing wells to steam injection  and recompleting wells to open additional pay intervals 
accelerated drilling of new wells is anticipated in in the fourth quarter of our net production from the field averaged mboe per day 
santa maria basin offshore california point arguello unit 
we hold a working interests in the point arguello unit and the various partnerships owning the related transportation  processing and marketing infrastructure 
the sellers of those interests retained responsibility for certain abandonment costs  including removing  dismantling and disposing of the existing offshore platforms  removing and disposing of all existing pipelines  and removing  dismantling  disposing and remediating all existing onshore facilities 
we are responsible for our share of all other abandonment costs  primarily well bore abandonments and conductor removals 
we are the operator for the point arguello unit  which consists of three offshore platforms 
in  we spent million on capital projects and our net average daily oil production for the unit in the fourth quarter of was mboe per day 
p e development 
we are the operator of federal offshore lease p and have agreements in place between the p owners and the point arguello unit owners that will allow us to participate with at least a working interest in the development of the east half of the p lease 
we applied for and received all the appropriate permits or modifications to existing permits from federal  state  and local agencies to allow for drilling into the east half of offshore lease p the west half of lease p has already been developed as part of the point arguello unit 
in october  we successfully completed the initial development well into the p e field also known as the rocky point structure 
a second well was placed on production in january and at the end of february the two wells were producing at a combined rate of approximately  barrels per day gross 
a third well was drilling in late february and we estimate up to five additional wells may be drilled to complete p e exploitation 
in we spent million on capital projects on p e point pedernales 
as a result of the nuevo acquisition  we acquired a working interest in the pt 
pedernales field which includes the onshore lompoc facilities and one platform  which is utilized to exploit the federal ocs monterey reservoir 
in we spent million on capital projects 
our net average daily production from our pt 
pedernales field in the fourth quarter of was mboe per day 
efforts are also underway to obtain the necessary permits and leasehold rights to exploit the offsetting tranquillon ridge monterey structure  utilizing directional wells drilled from the existing platform to a reservoir within the three mile state water limit 

table of contents gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana in  we spent million on exploration and development projects in this area 
we drilled a total of wells  six of which were successful success rate 
our successful wells included one non operated onshore well  four operated wells in state waters and one operated well in federal waters of the gulf of mexico 
planned activity includes two to three onshore wells  six to eight wells in state waters and five to seven wells in federal waters 
our net average daily oil and gas production for this area was mboe in the fourth quarter of in we acquired an interest in the breton sound extension area which is located east southeast of new orleans 
we operate portions of the area where we have a working interest and portions are operated by others where we have a working interest 
the wells are in water depths of ten to twenty five feet 
in we drilled and completed our first operated well in federal waters  in chandeleur area  as an expansion of our breton sound extension joint venture 
in we entered into a new joint venture covering six blocks in main pass area where two to three wells are planned for we have a working interest in the joint venture which is operated by an industry partner 
we are pursuing additional opportunities and to date have acquired the right to participate in six deep water drilling opportunities in the gulf of mexico 
east texas basin and north louisiana as a result of the tec merger we acquired interests included in the rosewood  white oak glenwood  beckville  carthage  east henderson and oak hill fields in east texas 
the predominant producing formation is the cotton valley sand gas reservoir with indicated potential additional pay in the shallower travis peak and pettit formations 
there are many proved undeveloped cotton valley drilling locations under regulatory field rules that now permit wells to be drilled on acre spacing as opposed to acre or larger spacing 
at year end we had identified proved undeveloped locations in this area 
in  we spent million on exploitation and development projects on these properties and participated in the drilling of development wells  all of which were successful 
our net average daily oil and gas production for this area was mboe in the fourth quarter of permian basin in west texas as a result of the nuevo acquisition we acquired an interest in the pakenham field in west texas which currently has producing gas wells 
the field is located in terrell county  texas within the overall permian basin complex of west texas on the southern margin of the val verde basin 
we are the operator with working interests ranging from to 
in we spent million on capital projects that included the drilling of seven development wells  one of which was dry 
production from the field averaged mboe per day in the fourth quarter of property divestments we periodically evaluate and from time to time elect to sell certain of our mature producing properties that we consider to be nonstrategic 
such sales enable us to focus on our core properties  maintain financial flexibility and redeploy the proceeds therefrom to activities that we believe potentially have a higher financial return 

table of contents in december  we completed the sale of certain properties located offshore california and onshore south texas  new mexico  and south louisiana 
these transactions included the divestment of platforms in federal and state waters off the coast of california and three related onshore facilities and essentially all our remaining assets in south texas and new mexico 
these divestments were conducted via negotiated and auction transactions 
in aggregate  we received net proceeds of approximately million from these transactions 
these amounts are subject to customary post closing adjustments and the offshore california sale is subject to certain post closing regulatory approvals and transfer conditions 
the offshore california properties were acquired in may as a result of the nuevo acquisition 
we have agreed to retain certain abandonment obligations in connection with the offshore california properties 
in a series of transactions in the first and second quarters of we sold our interests in certain non core producing properties in new mexico  texas  mississippi  louisiana  and illinois for proceeds of approximately million 
our oil and gas interests in the illinois basin were not in our core areas of operation and did not compete well for capital with the properties within our core areas 
the illinois properties also had high operating costs 
these factors led to the sale of our illinois properties through an extensive auction process 
the sale was completed through a stock purchase agreement with standard terms  including typical purchase price adjustments  representations and warranties  and assumption of liabilities by the purchaser for an adjusted purchase price of approximately million 
the reserves attributable to our illinois properties were not material in relation to our total reserves 
in  we sold our interest in predominantly non operated and noncore fields in the permian basin  the texas panhandle  east texas  the mid continent area  alabama  arkansas  mississippi  north dakota and new mexico for aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
other during the second and third quarters of  we sold certain real estate parcels acquired in the nuevo merger and received aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
the properties represented approximately surface acres located in santa barbara and los angeles counties in california 
in april  nuevo entered into definitive agreements for the sale of the stock of its subsidiaries that held oil and gas interests in the republic of congo 
the sale closed on july  and we received net cash consideration of approximately million 
when we acquired nuevo  the fair value of the investment in the congo operations was accounted for as an asset held for sale 
in december  nuevo sold its tonner hills residential development property for approximately million 
to date approximately million of the purchase price has been received and the remainder is due upon completion of certain habitat restoration activities  which we expect to complete during

year ended december  in thousands of dollars property acquisitions costs unproved properties proved properties exploration costs exploitation and development costs in connection with the acquisition of an additional interest in the point arguello field  offshore california  we assumed certain obligations of the seller 
as consideration for receiving the transferred properties and assuming such obligations  we received million 
in addition  we received million as our share of revenues less costs for the period april to july   the period prior to ownership 
exploitation and development costs include expenditures of million in  million in and million in related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves included in our proved oil and gas reserves at the beginning of each year

historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our oil and gas production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including location and quality differentials  seasonality  economic conditions  foreign imports  political conditions in other oil producing and gas producing countries  the actions of opec  and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
decreases in oil and 
table of contents gas prices have had  and could have in the future  an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
to manage our exposure to commodity price risks  we use various derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on oil and gas sales 
our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set 
however  ceiling prices in our hedges may cause us to receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
substantially all of our oil and gas production is transported by pipelines and trucks owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a reasonable fee could result in our having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary decreases in a significant portion of our oil and gas production 
a substantial portion of our oil and gas reserves are located in california and approximately of our production is attributable to heavy crude generally degree api gravity crude oil or lower 
our heavy crude is primarily sold to conocophilips under a year contract which expires on december  this contract provides for pricing based on a percentage of the nymex crude oil price for each type of crude oil that we produce and deliver to conocophillips in california 
this percentage may be renegotiated every two years  with the current percentage rates eligible for renegotiation effective at the end of we are currently receiving approximately of the nymex index price for crude oil sold under the conocophillips contract  representing approximately of our total crude oil production 
approximately of our crude oil production is sold through plains all american pipeline  lp paa with sold under contracts that provide for nymex less a fixed price differential currently averaging nymex less and sold under contracts that provide for monthly field posted prices 
these contracts expire at various times from january  through the marketing agreement with paa provides that paa will purchase for resale at market prices certain of our oil production for which paa charges a marketing fee of either or per barrel based upon the contract the barrels are resold under 
the remaining of our crude oil production is sold to others under contracts tied to monthly field posted prices 
all production volumes in the foregoing discussion are based on the company s fourth quarter production volumes  pro forma as if the property sales completed in the fourth quarter were effective as of october  the market price for california crude oil differs from the established market indices in the us  due principally to the higher transportation and refining costs associated with heavy oil 
while the contracts providing for nymex based pricing do not reduce our exposure to price volatility  they do help manage the risk of widening basis differentials between the nymex index price and the field posted prices for our california oil production 
during  the basis differentials for california crude oil widened significantly from past levels and the prices received by the company under nymex based crude oil contracts were favorable relative to the current market prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to receive the favorable differentials when the price differentials are renegotiated or that the market differentials will not decrease below our contracted prices 
deregulation of gas prices has increased competition and volatility of gas prices 
prices received for our gas are subject to seasonal variations and other fluctuations 
approximately of our gas production is sold monthly based on industry recognized  published index pricing 
the remaining is priced daily on the spot market 
fluctuations between the two pricing mechanisms can significantly impact the overall differential to the henry hub 

table of contents during  and sales to paa accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues and during sales to conocophillips accounted for of our total revenues 
during such periods no other purchaser accounted for more than of our total revenues 
the loss of any single significant customer or contract could have a material adverse short term effect  however  we do not believe that the loss of any single significant customer or contract would materially affect our business in the long term 
we believe such purchasers could be replaced by other purchasers under contracts with similar terms and conditions 
however  their role as the purchaser of a significant portion of our oil production does have the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that they may be affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions

the following table sets forth information with respect to our developed and undeveloped acreage as of december  developed acres undeveloped acres gross net gross net onshore california offshore california kansas louisiana oklahoma texas total less than of total net undeveloped acres are covered by leases that expire from through drilling activities information with regard to our drilling activities during the years ended december   and is set forth below year ended december  gross net gross net gross net exploratory wells oil gas dry development wells oil gas dry 
table of contents at december  there were development wells net and exploratory wells net in progress 
real estate we currently own surface and mineral rights in the following tracts of real property  portions of which are used in our oil and gas operations property location approximate acreage net to our interest inglewood los angeles county  california montebello los angeles county  california arroyo grande san luis obispo county  california  lompoc santa barbara county  california  gaviota santa barbara county  california in the course of our business  certain of our properties may be subject to easements or other incidental property rights and legal requirements that may affect the use and enjoyment of our property 
title to properties our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions 
we do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business 
we believe that we have generally satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we make minimal investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties 
we make title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel only before we commence drilling operations 
we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets 
although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases  we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business 
competition our competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies and numerous independent oil and gas companies  individuals and drilling and income programs 
many of our larger competitors possess and employ financial and personnel resources substantially greater than ours 
these competitors are able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry 
regulation our operations are subject to extensive regulations 
many federal  state and local departments and agencies are authorized by statute to issue  and have issued  laws and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual participants 
the failure to comply with these rules and 
table of contents regulations can result in substantial penalties 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
however  we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than are our competitors 
due to the myriad complex federal  state and local regulations that may affect us directly or indirectly  you should not rely on the following discussion of certain laws and regulations as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting our operations 
osha 
we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act  or osha  and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard  the united states environmental protection agency community right to know regulations  and similar state statutes require that we maintain certain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to our employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 
mms 
the mms has broad authority to regulate our oil and gas operations on offshore leases in federal waters 
it must approve and grant permits in connection with our drilling and development plans 
additionally  the mms has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications restricting the flaring or venting of gas  governing the plugging and abandonment of wells and controlling the removal of production facilities 
under certain circumstances  the mms may suspend or terminate any of our operations on federal leases  as discussed in risk factors governmental agencies and other bodies  including those in california  might impose regulations that increase our costs and may terminate or suspend our operations 
the mms has proposed regulations that would permit it to expel unsafe operators from offshore operations 
the mms has also established rules governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of oil produced from federal offshore leases and regulations regarding costs for gas transportation 
delays in the approval of plans and issuance of permits by the mms because of staffing  economic  environmental or other reasons could adversely affect our operations 
regulation of production 
oil and gas production is regulated under a wide range of federal and state statutes  rules  orders and regulations 
state and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties  the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the regulation of the spacing  plugging and abandonment of wells 
many states also restrict production to the market demand for oil and gas  and several states have indicated interest in revising applicable regulations 
these regulations limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
also  each state generally imposes an ad valorem  production or severance tax with respect to production and sale of oil  gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
pipeline regulation 
we have pipelines to deliver our production to sales points 
our pipelines are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement  and management of pipeline facilities 
in addition  we must permit access to and copying of records  and must make certain reports and provide information  as required by the secretary of transportation 
the states in which we have pipelines have comparable regulations 
some of our pipelines related to the point arguello unit are also subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc 
we believe that our pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements 

table of contents sale of gas 
the ferc regulates interstate gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions 
although the ferc does not regulate gas producers such as us  the agency s actions are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the gas industry 
to date  the ferc s pro competition policies have not materially affected our business or operations 
it is unclear what impact  if any  future rules or increased competition within the gas industry will have on our gas sales efforts 
the ferc  the united states congress or state regulatory agencies may consider additional proposals or proceedings that might affect the gas industry 
we cannot predict when or if these proposals will become effective or any effect they may have on our operations 
we do not believe  however  that any of these proposals will affect us any differently than other gas producers with which we compete 
environmental 
our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to safety  health and environmental protection  including the generation  storage  handling  emission and transportation of materials and the discharge of materials into the environment 
other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include  but are not necessarily limited to  the marine mammal protection act  the marine protection  research and sanctuaries act  the fish and wildlife coordination act  the fishery conservation and management act  the migratory bird treaty act and the national historic preservation act 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities  limit or prohibit construction  drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness or wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
as with our industry generally  our compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business  including our capital costs to construct  maintain  upgrade and close equipment and facilities 
although these regulations affect our capital expenditures and earnings  we believe that they do not affect our competitive position because our competitors that comply with such laws and regulations are similarly affected 
environmental laws and regulations have historically been subject to change  and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of these laws and regulations on our operations 
if a person violates these environmental laws and regulations and any related permits  they may be subject to significant administrative  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and construction bans or delays 
if we were to discharge hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment  we could  to the extent the event is not insured  incur substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage 
permits 
our operations are subject to various federal  state and local regulations that include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding and insurance requirements to drill  operate  plug and abandon  and restore the surface associated with our wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandonment of wells  the disposal of fluids and solids used in connection with our operations and air emissions associated with our operations 
also  we have permits from the city and county of los angeles  california  the city of culver city  california  the county of kern  california  and the county of santa barbara  california to operate crude oil  natural gas and related pipelines and equipment that run within the boundaries of these governmental entities 
the permits required for various aspects of our operations are subject to revocation  modification and renewal by issuing authorities 

table of contents plugging  abandonment and remediation obligations consistent with normal industry practices  substantially all of our oil and gas leases require that  upon termination of economic production  the working interest owners plug and abandon non producing wellbores  remove tanks  production equipment and flow lines and restore the wellsite 
typically when producing oil and gas assets are purchased  one assumes the obligation to plug and abandon wells that are part of such assets 
however  in some instances  we receive an indemnity with respect to those costs 
although we obtained environmental studies on our properties in california and we believe that such properties have been operated in accordance with standard oil field practices  certain of the fields have been in operation for over years  and current or future local  state and federal environmental laws and regulations may require substantial expenditures to comply with such rules and regulations 
in connection with the purchase of certain of our onshore california properties  we received a limited indemnity for certain conditions if they violate applicable local  state and federal environmental laws and regulations in effect on the date of such agreement 
we believe that we do not have any material obligations for operations conducted prior to our acquisition of these properties  other than our obligation to plug existing wells and those normally associated with customary oil field operations of similarly situated properties 
current or future local  state or federal rules and regulations may require us to spend material amounts to comply with such rules and regulations  and there can be no assurance that any portion of such amounts will be recoverable under the indemnity 
we estimate our cash expenditures related to plugging  abandonment and remediation will be approximately million 
due to the long life of our onshore california reserve base we do not expect our cash outlays for such expenditures for these properties will increase significantly in the next several years 
although our offshore california properties have a shorter reserve life  third parties have retained the majority of the obligations for abandoning these properties 
in connection with the sale of certain properties offshore california in december we retained the responsibility for certain abandonment costs  including removing  dismantling and disposing of the existing offshore platforms 
the present value of such abandonment costs  million million undiscounted  are included in our asset retirement obligation as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we agreed to guarantee the performance of the purchaser with respect to the remaining abandonment obligations related to the properties approximately million 
employees as of february  we had full time employees  of whom were field personnel involved in oil and gas producing activities 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
volatile oil and gas prices could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our success is largely dependent on oil and gas prices  which are extremely volatile 
any substantial or extended decline in the price of oil and gas below current levels will have a negative 
table of contents impact on our business operations and future revenues 
moreover  oil and gas prices depend on factors we cannot control  such as supply and demand for oil and gas and expectations regarding supply and demand  weather  actions by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  political conditions in other oil producing and gas producing countries including the possibility of insurgency or war in such areas  the prices of foreign exports and the availability of alternate fuel sources  general economic conditions in the united states and worldwide  and governmental regulations 
with respect to our business  prices of oil and gas will affect our revenues  cash flows  profitability and earnings  our ability to attract capital to finance our operations and the cost of such capital  the amount that we are allowed to borrow  and the value of our oil and gas properties 
any prolonged  substantial reduction in the demand for oil and gas  or distribution problems in meeting this demand  could adversely affect our business 
our success is materially dependent upon the demand for oil and gas 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including the demand for and supply of oil and gas  the availability of alternative energy sources  the proximity of reserves to  and the capacity of  oil and gas gathering systems  pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities 
we may also have to shut in some of our wells temporarily due to a lack of market or adverse weather conditions including hurricanes 
if the demand for oil and gas diminishes  our financial results would be negatively impacted 
in addition  there are limitations related to the methods of transportation for our production 
substantially all of our oil and gas production is transported by pipelines and trucks owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a reasonable fee could result in our having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary curtailment of a significant portion of our oil and gas production  any of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
the majority of our oil production in california is dedicated to two customers and as a result  our credit exposure to those customers is significant 
we have entered into oil marketing arrangements with plains all american pipeline  lp  or paa  and with conocophillips under which paa or conocophillips purchase the majority of our net oil production in california 
we generally do not require letters of credit or other collateral from paa or from conocophillips to support these trade receivables 
accordingly  a material adverse change in paa s or conocophillips s financial condition could adversely impact our ability to collect the applicable receivables  and thereby affect our financial condition 

table of contents if we are unable to replace the reserves that we have produced  our reserves and revenues will decline 
our future success depends on our ability to find  develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable which  in itself  is dependent on oil and gas prices 
without continued successful exploitation  acquisition or exploration activities  our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 
we may not be able to find or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs 
we may not be successful in acquiring  exploiting  developing or exploring for oil and gas properties 
the successful acquisition  exploitation or development of  or exploration for  oil and gas properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices and operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities  and other factors 
these assessments are necessarily inexact 
as a result  we may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property  or may not recognize an acceptable return from properties we do acquire 
in addition  our exploitation and development and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves 
our operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of inadequate capital or other factors  such as title problems  weather  compliance with governmental regulations or price controls  mechanical difficulties  or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
in addition  exploitation and development costs may greatly exceed initial estimates 
in that case  we would be required to make unanticipated expenditures of additional funds to develop these projects  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  exploration for oil and gas  particularly offshore  has inherent and historically higher risk than exploitation and development activities 
future reserve increases and production may be dependent on our success in our exploration efforts  which may be unsuccessful 
estimates of oil and gas reserves depend on many assumptions that may be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies could adversely affect the quantity and value of our oil and gas reserves 
the proved oil and gas reserve information included in this document represents only estimates 
these estimates are based on reports prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
the estimates were calculated using oil and gas prices in effect on the dates indicated in the reports 
any significant price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our reserves 
petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including historical production from the area compared with production from other comparable producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  
table of contents assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the timing of the recovery of oil and gas reserves  the production and operating costs incurred  and the amount and timing of future development expenditures 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will vary from estimates and the variances may be material 
the discounted future net revenues included in this document should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net revenues will also be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which the sec requires to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and gas industry in general 
the geographic concentration and lack of marketable characteristics of our oil reserves may have a greater effect on our ability to sell our oil compared to other companies 
a substantial portion of our oil and gas reserves are located in california 
because our reserves are not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors  our business is subject to local conditions more than other  more diversified companies 
any regional events  including price fluctuations  natural disasters  and restrictive regulations  that increase costs  reduce availability of equipment or supplies  reduce demand or limit our production may impact our operations more than if our reserves were more geographically diversified 
our california oil production is heavier than premium grade light oil 
due to the processes required to refine this type of oil and the transportation requirements  it is difficult to market california oil production outside california 
additionally  the margin sales price minus production costs on heavy oil sales is generally less than that of lighter oil due to price differentials  and the effect of material price decreases will more adversely affect the profitability of heavy oil production compared with lighter grades of oil 

table of contents operating hazards  natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities  which may not be fully covered by our insurance 
the oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  pollution  and releases of toxic gas 
in addition  our operations in california are especially susceptible to damage from natural disasters such as earthquakes  mudslides and fires 
any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries  fatalities  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages  or property damage  which could expose us to liabilities 
the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce  or even eliminate  the funds available for exploration  development  and acquisition  or could result in a loss of our properties 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities 
the insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years 
as a result  we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability  especially environmental liability  is currently available at reasonable cost 
if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits  or if we incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  then our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our offshore operations are subject to substantial regulations and risks  which could adversely affect our ability to operate and our financial results 
we conduct operations offshore california and louisiana 
our offshore activities are subject to more extensive governmental regulation than our other oil and gas activities 
in addition  we are vulnerable to the risks associated with operating offshore  including risks relating to hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions  oil field service costs and availability  compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations  remediation and other costs resulting from oil spill releases of hazardous materials and other environmental damages  and failure of equipment or facilities 
if we experience any of these events  we may incur substantial liabilities  which could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

table of contents governmental agencies and other bodies  including those in california  might impose regulations that increase our costs and may terminate or suspend our operations 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations as interpreted by governmental agencies and other bodies  including those in california  vested with broad authority relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
existing laws and regulations  or their interpretations  could be changed  and any changes could increase costs of compliance and costs of operating drilling equipment or significantly limit drilling activity 
under certain circumstances  the united states minerals management service  or mms  may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated 
these circumstances include our failure to pay royalties or our failure to comply with safety and environmental regulations 
the requirements imposed by these laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to new interpretations 
environmental liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 
the oil and gas business is subject to environmental hazards  such as oil spills  gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of petroleum products and hazardous substances  and historic disposal activities 
these environmental hazards could expose us to material liabilities for property damages  personal injuries or other environmental harm  including costs of investigating and remediating contaminated properties 
we also may be liable for environmental damages caused by the previous owners or operators of properties we have purchased or are currently operating 
a variety of stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of our business and impose strict requirements for  among other things well drilling or workover  operation and abandonment  waste management  land reclamation  financial assurance under the oil pollution act of  and controlling air  water and waste emissions 
any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative  civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 
additionally  our compliance with these laws may  from time to time  result in increased costs to our operations or decreased production  and may affect our costs of acquisitions 
in addition  environmental laws may  in the future  cause a decrease in our production or cause an increase in our costs of production  development or exploration 
pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
some of our onshore california fields have been in operation for more than years  and current or future local  state and federal environmental and other laws and regulations may require substantial expenditures to remediate the properties or to otherwise comply with these laws and regulations 
in addition  approximately acres of our acres in the montebello field have been designated as california coastal sage scrub  a known habitat for the coastal california gnatcatcher  which is a type of bird designated as threatened under the federal endangered species act 
a variety of existing laws  rules and guidelines govern activities that can be conducted on properties that contain coastal sage scrub and gnatcatchers and generally limit the scope of operations that we can conduct on this property 
the presence of coastal sage scrub and gnatcatchers in the montebello field and other 
table of contents existing or future laws  rules and guidelines could prohibit or limit our operations and our planned activities for this property 
our acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
our growth strategy may include acquiring oil and gas businesses and properties 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  the need to integrate acquired operations  potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies  difficulty in assuming recoverable reserves  future production rates  operating costs  infrastructure requirements  environmental and other liabilities  and other factors beyond our control  potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired business  and an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows from the acquired businesses or realize other anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
we intend to continue hedging a portion of our production  which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and gas 
we reduce our exposure to the volatility of oil and gas prices by actively hedging a portion of our production 
hedging also prevents us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the hedge agreement 
in a typical hedge transaction  we have the right to receive from the hedge counterparty the excess of the maximum fixed price specified in the hedge agreement over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the maximum fixed price  we must pay the counterparty this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged even if we had insufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge agreement 
accordingly  if we have less production than we have hedged when the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we must make payments against which there are no offsetting sales of production 
if these payments become too large  the remainder of our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  our hedging agreements expose us to risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations 
loss of key executives and failure to attract qualified management could limit our growth and negatively impact our operations 
successfully implementing our strategies will depend  in part  on our management team 
the loss of members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
our exploration and exploitation success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced engineers  geoscientists and other professionals 
competition for experienced professionals is extremely intense 
if we cannot attract or retain experienced technical personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed 
we do not have key man insurance 

table of contents under our tax allocation agreement with our former parent  plains resources inc  if we take actions that cause the distribution of our stock by plains resources to its stockholders to fail to qualify as a tax free transaction  we will be required to indemnify plains resources for the resulting tax liability and may not have sufficient financial resources to achieve our growth strategy or ability to repay debt  or it may prevent a change in control of us 
prior to december  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of plains resources inc plains resources  now known as vulcan energy corporation 
on december  plains resources distributed of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to the holders of record of plains resources common stock as of december  each plains resources stockholder received one share of our common stock for each share of plains resources common stock held 
plains resources received a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service stating that for united states federal income tax purposes  the distribution of our common stock qualified as a tax free distribution under section of the internal revenue code 
we have agreed with plains resources that we will not take any action inconsistent with any information  covenant or representation provided to the internal revenue service in connection with obtaining the tax ruling stating that the spin off will generally be tax free to plains resources and its stockholders and we further agreed to be liable for any taxes arising from a breach of that agreement 
in addition  we have agreed that  for three years following the spin off  we will not engage in any transaction that could adversely affect the tax treatment of the spin off without the prior written consent of plains resources  unless we obtain a supplemental tax ruling from the internal revenue service or a tax opinion acceptable to plains resources of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that the proposed transaction would not adversely affect the tax treatment of the spin off 
moreover  we will be liable to plains resources for any corporate level taxes incurred by plains resources as a result of the spin off or to specified transactions involving us following the spin off including the acquisition of of our common stock by any person or persons 
to the extent the taxes arise as a result of a change of control of plains resources  failure of plains resources to continue the active conduct of its trade or business or failure of plains resources to comply with the representations underlying its tax ruling or a supplemental tax ruling relating to the spin off  plains resources will be solely responsible for the taxes resulting from the spin off 
if there are any corporate level taxes incurred by plains resources as a result of the spin off and not due to any of the factors discussed in the two preceding sentences  we would be responsible for of any such liability 
the amount of any indemnification payments would be substantial and would likely result in events of default under all of our credit arrangements 
as a result  we likely would not have sufficient financial resources to achieve our growth strategy or  possibly  repay our indebtedness after making these payments 
as a result of the tax principles and agreements with plains resources discussed above  we may be highly limited in our ability to take the following steps in the future issue equity in public or private offerings  issue equity as part of the consideration in acquisitions of additional assets  or undergo a change of control 
our net income could be negatively affected by stock appreciation rights charges 
stock appreciation rights sars are subject to variable accounting treatment 
as a result  at the end of each quarter  we compare the per share closing price of our common stock to the exercise price of each stock appreciation right that is vested or for accounting purposes is deemed vested at the end of the quarter 
under current accounting rules  to the extent the closing price exceeds the exercise price  we will recognize the excess as an accounting charge to the extent we did not previously recognize such excess 
if  at the end of the quarter  the per share closing price of our common stock 
table of contents decreased  the stock appreciation right accounting charge would decrease  resulting in increased net income for us 
for the year ended december  we recognized million of sar expense 
based on the number of stock appreciation rights outstanding at december   a change in the price of our common stock would result in a change of million in our net income 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements effective with the third quarter of  under sfas no 
r our sars will be remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
we have not determined how the new method of valuing stock based compensation as prescribed in sfas r will be applied to valuing stock based awards and the impact the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on our financial statements 
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of goodwill impairments 
in a purchase transaction  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price plus the liabilities assumed  including deferred income taxes recorded in connection with the merger  over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in our acquisitions of tec and nuevo  goodwill totaled million and represented of our total assets at december  goodwill is not amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill is deemed impaired to the extent of any excess of its carrying amount over the residual fair value of the reporting unit 
such impairment could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill and stockholders equity 
the most significant factors that could result in the impairment of our goodwill would be significant declines in oil and gas prices and or reserve volumes which would result in a decline in the fair value of our oil and gas properties 
item legal proceedings we are a defendant in various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business 
while the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  we do not believe that the outcome of these legal proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
company overview we are an independent oil and gas company primarily engaged in the activities of acquiring  developing  exploiting  exploring and producing oil and gas properties in the united states 
we own oil and gas properties in five states with principal operations in the los angeles and san joaquin basins onshore california  the santa maria basin offshore california  the gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana  including the gulf of mexico  the east texas basin in east texas and north louisiana  and the val verde portion of the greater permian basin in texas 
assets in our principal focus areas include mature properties with long lived reserves and significant development and exploitation opportunities as well as newer properties with development  exploitation and exploration potential 
we have historically hedged portions of our oil and gas production to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations and our revolving credit facility 
at december  we had approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
we have a capital budget for of approximately million 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity through our cash from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to meet our short term and long term normal recurring operating needs  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
in addition  the majority of our capital expenditures are discretionary and could be curtailed if our cash flows declined from expected levels 
our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and gas  the success of our acquisition and drilling activities and the operational performance of our producing properties 
we hedge to limit our commodity price exposure 
the level of hedging activity depends on our view of market conditions  available hedge prices and our operating strategy 
under our hedging program  we have typically hedged up to of our production for the current year  up to of our production for the next year and up to of our production for the following year 
our hedging activities mitigate our exposure to price declines and allow us the flexibility to continue to execute our capital plan even if prices decline during the period our hedges are in place 
hedging also prevents us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the hedge agreement 
in a typical hedge transaction  we have the right to receive from the hedge counterparty the excess of the maximum fixed price specified in the hedge agreement over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the maximum fixed price  we must pay the counterparty this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged even if we had insufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge agreement 
accordingly  if we have less production than we have hedged when the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we must make payments against which there are no offsetting sales of production 
if these payments become too large  the remainder of our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  our hedging agreements expose us to risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations 

table of contents completion of our acquisition of nuevo had a significant impact on our company 
we now have a large proved reserve base that is proved developed  a significantly improved balance sheet and an attractive growth profile 
the combined company is expected to generate significant cash flow that will be available for debt reduction and future growth opportunities 
acquisitions and dispositions on may  we acquired nuevo in a stock for stock transaction

in connection with our acquisition of nuevo we have completed a series of transactions to refinance a portion of our and all of nuevo s outstanding debt the recapitalization transactions 
see financing activities 
on june   we acquired tec for a combination of cash and common stock 
we accounted for the acquisition of tec as a purchase effective june  see items and business and properties 
acquisition of tec energy corporation 
we periodically evaluate and from time to time have elected to sell certain of our mature producing properties that we consider to be nonstrategic 
such sales enable us to focus on our core properties  maintain financial flexibility and redeploy the proceeds therefrom to activities that we believe potentially have a higher financial return 
in december  we completed the sale of certain properties located offshore california and onshore south texas  new mexico  and south louisiana 
these divestments were conducted via negotiated and auction transactions and we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in a series of transactions in the first and second quarters of we sold our interests in certain non core producing properties in new mexico  texas  mississippi  louisiana  and illinois for proceeds of approximately million 
in  we sold our interest in predominantly non operated and noncore fields in the permian basin  the texas panhandle  east texas  the mid continent area  alabama  arkansas  mississippi  north dakota and new mexico for aggregate proceeds of approximately million

description of properties property divestments 
hedge restructuring in september we entered into new oil price collars for the period through and eliminated approximately of our fixed price crude oil swaps 
by converting fixed price swaps to collars we retained downside protection while potentially capturing significantly higher cash flow 
in addition  we now have certainty of an attractive price range for a meaningful amount of our production for the next several years 
specifically  we exchanged existing oil price swaps with respect to  barrels of oil per day at an average price of for new oil price collars relating to  barrels of oil per day during the period through that have a floor price of and an average ceiling price of 
our only remaining crude oil swaps involve  barrels of oil per day in the first quarter and  barrels of oil per day in the second quarter  at fixed prices averaging and  respectively 
the restructured collars as well as certain other commodity derivative contracts to which we are a party  do not qualify for hedge accounting 
consequently  these contracts are marked to market each quarter with changes in fair value recognized currently as a derivative gain or loss on the income statement 
for example  if the forward curve for oil prices is higher at the end of an accounting period than at the beginning of the period a derivative fair value loss will be recorded 
conversely  if the forward curve for oil prices declines during the accounting period a fair value gain will be recorded 
as a consequence of this accounting treatment we expect that there will be significant volatilty in our reported earnings 
cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making or receiving a payment from the counterparty 

table of contents during we recognized a pre tax loss of million from derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the foregoing amount consists of mark to market losses of million and cash settlements of million 
price differentials our realized wellhead oil and gas prices are lower than the nymex index level as a result of location and quality differentials 
a substantial portion of our oil and gas reserves are located in california and approximately of our production is attributable to heavy crude generally degree api gravity crude oil or lower 
our heavy crude is primarily sold to conocophilips under a year contract which expires on december  this contract provides for pricing based on a fixed percentage of the nymex crude oil price for each type of crude oil that we produce and deliver to conocophillips in california 
this fixed percentage may be renegotiated every two years  with the current fixed percentage rates eligible for renegotiation effective at the end of we are currently receiving approximately of the nymex index price for crude oil sold under the conocophillips contract  representing approximately of our total crude oil production 
approximately of our crude oil production is sold through plains all american pipeline  lp paa with sold under contracts that provide for nymex less a fixed price differential currently averaging nymex less and sold under contracts that provide for monthly field posted prices 
these contracts expire at various times from january  through the marketing agreement with paa provides that paa will purchase for resale at market prices certain of our oil production for which paa charges a marketing fee of either or per barrel based upon the contract the barrels are resold under 
the remaining of our crude oil production is sold to others under contracts tied to monthly field posted prices 
all production volumes in the foregoing discussion are based on the company s fourth quarter production volumes  pro forma as if the property sales completed in the fourth quarter were effective as of october  the market price for california crude oil differs from the established market indices in the us  due principally to the higher transportation and refining costs associated with heavy oil 
while the contracts providing for nymex based pricing do not reduce our exposure to price volatility  they do help manage the risk of widening basis differentials between the nymex index price and the field posted prices for our california oil production 
during  the basis differentials for california crude oil widened significantly from past levels and the prices received by the company under nymex based crude oil contracts were favorable relative to the current market prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to receive the favorable differentials when the price differentials are renegotiated or that the market differentials will not decrease below our contracted prices 
deregulation of gas prices has increased competition and volatility of gas prices 
prices received for our gas are subject to seasonal variations and other fluctuations 
approximately of our gas production is sold monthly based on industry recognized  published index pricing 
the remaining is priced daily on the spot market 
fluctuations between the two pricing mechanisms can significantly impact the overall differential to the henry hub 
results overview primarily as a result of the million derivative mark to market loss  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share for compared to net income of million  or per diluted share for net income includes the effect of the properties in our acquisition of nuevo  which are included in our results effective may   and the effect of the properties in our 
table of contents acquisition of tec which are included in our results effective june  net income for includes a non cash  after tax million credit related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
income from operations increased to million in from million in the improvement is primarily attributable to higher oil and gas sales as a result of increased sales volumes due to the nuevo and tec properties and increased oil and gas prices 
the increase in income from operations was offset by the derivative mark to market loss  debt extinguishment costs  expenses related to stock appreciation rights and higher interest costs related to the nuevo and tec acquisitions 
general we follow the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development activities are capitalized 
our revenues are derived from the sale of oil  gas and natural gas liquids 
we recognize revenues when our production is sold and title is transferred 
our revenues are highly dependent upon the prices of  and demand for  oil and gas 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our oil and gas and our levels of production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including supply and demand  economic conditions  foreign imports  the actions of opec  political conditions in other oil producing countries  and governmental regulation  legislation and policies 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules  we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter to determine a ceiling value of our properties 
the rules require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed the allowed ceiling 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves will fluctuate in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 
decreases in oil and gas prices have had  and will likely have in the future  an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
our oil and gas production expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel involved in production activities  steam gas costs  electric costs  maintenance costs  production  ad valorem and severance taxes  and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties 
depletion of capitalized costs of producing oil and gas properties is provided using the units of production method based upon proved reserves 
for the purposes of computing depletion  proved reserves are redetermined as of the end of each year and on an interim basis when deemed necessary 
general and administrative expenses g a consist primarily of salaries and related benefits of administrative personnel  office rent  systems costs and other administrative costs

our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and gas and the success of our acquisition and drilling activities 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging portions of our production and thereby mitigate our exposure to price declines 
this allows us the flexibility to continue to execute our capital plan even if prices decline during the period our hedges are in place

we will incur cash expenditures upon the exercise of sars  but our common shares outstanding will not increase 
at december  we had approximately million sars outstanding of which million were vested 
if all of the vested sars were exercised  based on  the price of our common stock as of december   we would pay million to holders of the sars 
in we made cash payments of million for sars that were exercised during that period 

table of contents commitments and contingencies contractual obligations 
at december   the aggregate amounts of contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years are as follows in thousands and and thereafter operating leases producing property remediation long term debt interest on debt natural gas purchase contract other operating leases relate primarily to obligations associated with our office facilities and certain cogeneration operations in california 
the obligation for producing property remediation consists of obligations associated with the purchase of certain of our california properties 
the long term debt and interest payments amounts consist of amounts due under our credit facility  notes and notes and interest payments to maturity 
the principal amount under our credit facility varies based on our cash inflows and outflows and the amounts reflected in this table assume the principal amount outstanding at december  remains outstanding to maturity with interest and commitment fees calculated at the rates in effect at that date 
our liabilities also include asset retirement obligations million current and million long term that represent the estimated fair value at december  of our obligations with respect to the retirement abandonment of our oil and gas properties 
each reporting period the liability is accreted to its then present value 
the ultimate settlement amount and the timing of the settlement of such obligations is unknown because they are subject to  among other things  federal  state and local regulation and economic factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity derivative contracts million current and million long term that represent net liabilities for oil and gas commodity derivatives based on their estimated fair value at december  the ultimate settlement amounts of such contracts are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk

see critical accounting policies and factors that may affect future results stock appreciation rights 
environmental matters 
as discussed under business properties regulation environmental  as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties  we are subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of  
table of contents the environment 
often these regulations are more burdensome on older properties that were operated before the regulations came into effect such as some of our properties in california that have operated for over years 
we have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
we also maintain insurance coverage for environmental matters  which we believe is customary in the industry  but we are not fully insured against all environmental risks 
there can be no assurance that current or future local  state or federal rules and regulations will not require us to spend material amounts to comply with such rules and regulations 
in january we discovered and self reported a violation related to flared gas emissions in excess of permitted levels on properties acquired in the nuevo acquisition 
estimated excess emissions from the san joaquin valley casing vent recovery system located on the gamble lease are approximately tons over a day period 
we brought the facility into compliance within days of discovering the violation 
plugging  abandonment and remediation obligations 
consistent with normal industry practices  substantially all of our oil and gas leases require that  upon termination of economic production  the working interest owners plug and abandon non producing wellbores  remove tanks  production equipment and flow lines and restore the wellsite 
typically  when producing oil and gas assets are purchased the purchaser assumes the obligation to plug and abandon wells that are part of such assets 
however  in some instances  we received an indemnity with respect to those costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect on these indemnities 
we estimate our cash expenditures related to plugging  abandonment and remediation will be approximately million 
due to the long life of our onshore california reserve base we do not expect our cash outlays for such expenditures for these properties will increase significantly in the next several years 
although our offshore california properties have a shorter reserve life  third parties have retained the majority of the obligations for abandoning these properties 
in connection with the sale of certain properties offshore california in december we retained the responsibility for certain abandonment costs  including removing  dismantling and disposing of the existing offshore platforms 
the present value of such abandonment costs  million million undiscounted  are included in our asset retirement obligation as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we agreed to guarantee the performance of the purchaser with respect to the remaining abandonment obligations related to the properties approximately million 
for a further discussion of our obligations to incur plugging  abandonment and remediation costs  see items and business and properties plugging  abandonment and remediation obligations 
other commitments and contingencies 
as is common within the industry  we have entered into various commitments and operating agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from proved crude oil and natural gas properties and the marketing  transportation and storage of crude oil 
it is management s belief that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
operating risks and insurance coverage 
our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and gas  including well blowouts  cratering  explosions  oil spills  gas or well fluids  fires  pollution and releases of toxic gas  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells  production facilities or other property  or injury to persons 
our operations in california  including transportation of oil by pipelines within the city and county of los angeles  are especially susceptible to damage from earthquakes and involve increased 
table of contents risks of personal injury  property damage and marketing interruptions because of the population density of southern california 
although we maintain insurance coverage considered to be customary in the industry  we are not fully insured against all risks  either because insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
we maintain coverage for earthquake damages in california but this coverage may not provide for the full effect of damages that could occur and we may be subject to additional liabilities 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating our pipelines  including the potential loss of significant revenues 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences 
sale of nuevo s congo operations 
upon our acquisition of nuevo  we became a party to an existing agreement between nuevo  cms nomeco oil gas co 
cms and a third party 
under the agreement  nuevo and cms may be liable to the third party for the recapture of dual consolidated losses dcls in connection with each company s acquisition of congolese properties 
nuevo and cms agreed to indemnify each other for any act that would cause the third party to experience a liability from the recapture of dcls as a result of a triggering event 
cms sold its interest in the congolese properties to a subsidiary of perenco  sa perenco in the sale did not trigger recapture  as both cms and perenco filed a request for a closing agreement with the internal revenue service irs in accordance with the u 
s consolidated return regulations 
similarly  we do not expect that our merger with nuevo  nor the sale of our interest in the congolese properties to perenco will trigger recapture 
we  along with perenco and the irs  expect to finalize two closing agreements in the near future 
the estimated remaining contingent liabilities are million relative to nuevo s former interest  and million relative to cms former interest  for which we would be jointly liable 
we believe the occurrence of a triggering event is remote and we do not believe the agreements will have a material adverse affect upon us 
industry concentration financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable with respect to our oil and gas operations and derivative instruments related to our hedging activities 
during  and sales to paa accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues and during sales to conocophillips accounted for of our total revenues 
during such periods no other purchaser accounted for more than of our total revenues 
the loss of any single significant customer or contract could have a material adverse short term effect  however  we do not believe that the loss of any single significant customer or contract would materially affect our business in the long term 
we believe such purchasers could be replaced by other purchasers under contracts with similar terms and conditions 
however  their role as the purchaser of a significant portion of our oil production does have the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that they may be affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
the contract counterparties for our derivative commodity contracts are all major financial institutions with standard poor s ratings of a or better 
six of the financial institutions are participating lenders in our credit facility  with one such counterparty holding contracts that represent approximately of the fair value of all of our open positions at december there are a limited number of alternative methods of transportation for our production 
substantially all of our oil and gas production is transported by pipelines and trucks owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a 
table of contents reasonable fee could result in our having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary curtailment of a significant portion of our oil and gas production which could have a negative impact on future results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and factors that may affect future results based on the accounting policies which we have in place  certain factors may impact our future financial results 
the most significant of these factors and their effect on certain of our accounting policies are discussed below 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
prices for oil and gas have historically been volatile 
decreases in oil and gas prices from current levels will adversely affect our revenues  results of operations  cash flows and proved reserves 
if the industry experiences significant prolonged future price decreases  this could be materially adverse to our operations and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures 
periodically  we enter into hedging arrangements relating to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce our exposure to adverse price fluctuations 
hedging instruments used are typically fixed price swaps and collars and purchased puts and calls 
while the use of these types of hedging instruments limits our downside risk to adverse price movements  we are subject to a number of risks  including instances in which the benefit to revenues is limited when commodity prices increase 
certain collars and other commodity derivative contracts to which we are a party do not qualify for hedge accounting 
consequently  these contracts are marked to market each quarter with changes in fair value recognized currently as a derivative gain or loss on the income statement 
for example  if the forward curve for oil prices is higher at the end of an accounting period than at the beginning of the period a derivative fair value loss will be recorded 
conversely  if the forward curve for oil prices declines during the accounting period a fair value gain will be recorded 
as a consequence of this accounting treatment we expect that there will be significant volatilty in our reported earnings 
cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making or receiving a payment from the counterparty 
the estimation of fair values of hedging derivatives requires substantial judgment 
we estimate the fair values of our derivatives using an option pricing model 
the option pricing model utilizes various factors including nymex and over the counter price quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted using rates under our revolving credit facility 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differentials and interest rates 
for a further discussion concerning our risks related to oil and gas prices and our hedging programs  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
write downs under full cost ceiling test rules 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  and deferred income taxes may not exceed a ceiling equal to the standardized measure including  for this test only  the effect of any related hedging activities  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties not included in the costs being amortized net of related tax effects 

table of contents these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  even if only for a short period of time  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 
oil and gas reserves 
our proved reserve information is based on estimates prepared by outside engineering firms 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than these estimates 
estimates of proved reserves may be different from the actual quantities of oil and gas recovered because such estimates depend on many assumptions and are based on operating conditions and results at the time the estimate is made 
the actual results of drilling and testing  as well as changes in production rates and recovery factors  can vary significantly from those assumed in the preparation of reserve estimates 
as a result  such factors have historically  and can in the future  cause significant upward and downward revisions to proved reserve estimates 
you should not assume that pv is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
a large portion of our reserve base approximately at december  is comprised of oil properties that are sensitive to oil price volatility 
historically  we have experienced significant upward and downward revisions to our reserves volumes and values as a result of changes in year end oil and gas prices and the corresponding adjustment to the projected economic life of such properties 
prices for oil and gas are likely to continue to be volatile  resulting in future downward and upward revisions to our reserve base 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves including future development and abandonment costs as well as our level of capital spending 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing our net income 
this decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the ceiling test discussed above 
in addition  increases in costs required to develop our reserves would increase the rate at which we record dd a expense 
we are unable to predict changes in future development costs as such costs are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions 
stock appreciation rights 
sars are subject to variable accounting treatment under us generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result  at the end of each quarter  we compare the closing price of our common stock on the last day of the quarter to the exercise price of each outstanding or unexercised sar that is vested or for accounting purposes is deemed vested at the end of the quarter 
for example  if a sar is scheduled to vest on december  for accounting purposes one fourth of the shares are deemed to vest at the end of each quarter even though no vesting occurs until december under current accounting rules  to the extent the closing price at the end of each quarter exceeds the exercise price of each sar  we will recognize such excess as an accounting charge for the sars deemed vested to the extent such excess has not previously been recognized as expense 
if the quarter end closing price decreases compared to prior periods  we will recognize credits to income  to the extent we have previously recognized expense 
these quarterly charges and 
table of contents credits will make our results of operations depend  in part  on fluctuations in the price of our common stock and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we will incur cash expenditures as sars are exercised  but our outstanding common shares will not increase 
we recognized compensation expense of million related to sars for the year ended december   representing the increase in our stock price and the vesting deemed to have occurred during the year 
in we made cash payments of million for sars that were exercised during the year 
as of december   we have approximately million sars outstanding with an average exercise price of  of which million of the sars were deemed vested 
based on the number of stock appreciation rights outstanding at december   a change in the price of our common stock would result in a change of million in our net income 
under sfas no 
r revised  effective with the third quarter of  our sars will be remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
we have not determined how the new method of valuing stock based compensation as prescribed in sfas r will impact the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards in our financial statements 
goodwill 
in a purchase transaction  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price plus the liabilities assumed  including deferred income taxes recorded in connection with the merger  over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
at december  goodwill totaled million and represented approximately of our total assets 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized  it is tested at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
a two step impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
we follow the full cost method of accounting and all of our operations are located in the united states 
we have determined that for the purpose of performing an impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 the company is the reporting unit 
sfas states that quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement  if available 
accordingly  we use the quoted market price of our common stock to determine the fair value of our reporting unit 
an impairment of goodwill could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill and stockholders equity 
the most significant factors that could result in the impairment of our goodwill would be significant declines in oil and gas prices and or estimated reserve volumes which would result in a decline in the fair value of our reporting unit 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september the sec published staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which is effective january  sab relates to the staff s views regarding the application of sfas by oil and gas producing companies following the full cost accounting method 
sab requires that the future outflows associated with settling aros that have been accrued on the balance sheet should be excluded from the computation of the present value of estimated future net revenues for purposes of the full cost ceiling test calculation 
sab also requires that to the extent that estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values  have not been included as capitalized costs in the base for computing depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a because they have not yet been capitalized as asset retirement costs under sfas  such costs that will be incurred as a result of future development activities on proved reserves should be estimated and included in the costs to be amortized 
our computation of dd a is in compliance with the guidance in sab our ceiling test calculation at december  is in compliance with the guidance in sab and compliance with such guidelines in prior periods would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r that requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
public entities other than those filing as small business issuers will be required to apply sfas r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are in the process of determining how the new method of valuing stock based compensation as prescribed in sfas r will be applied to valuing stock based awards and the impact the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on our financial statements 
in february  the sec issued guidance concerning the specific circumstance of a property disposition by a company that follows the full cost accounting method that resulted in a less than alteration of the proved oil and gas reserve quantities within a full cost center 
in connection with that disposition  the sec considered if goodwill should be allocated to the property disposed  and  if so  whether that allocated goodwill should remain as a component of the capitalized full cost center or be reflected in the statement of operations 
the sec concluded that only the fair value allocated to the oil and gas properties in a business acquisition should be included in the costs accounted for under rule c of regulation s x 
goodwill associated with acquisitions of oil and gas properties that constitute a business is recognized in accordance with sfas but accounted for outside of the full cost rules 
therefore  when dispositions of these properties occur  the goodwill previously recognized does not affect the associated adjustments contemplated under rule c i 
rather  the accounting for the goodwill and any potential impairment should follow the provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
companies are required to consider whether a property disposition that results in a less than alteration of the proved oil and gas reserve quantities within a given cost center is a trigger that requires goodwill be evaluated for impairment under sfas the sec has not yet addressed whether any portion of goodwill should be allocated to a disposition of greater than  but less than  of the oil and gas reserves in a given cost center 
we determined that the property dispositions completed in the fourth quarter of did not cause an impairment of goodwill 
in the first quarter of  prior to the sec guidance on this issue  we 
table of contents recorded a million decrease in goodwill in connection with the sale of our illinois properties and recognized this amount as an adjustment to oil and gas properties subject to amortization 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks commodity price risk commodity derivatives 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging portions of our oil and gas production through the use of derivative instruments 
the derivative instruments currently consist of oil and gas swaps  collars and option contracts entered into with financial institutions 
although certain of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting  we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
derivative instruments utilized to manage commodity price risk are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
under sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if a derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the changes in fair value are recognized currently in our earnings as other income expense 
if a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting  the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income oci  a component of stockholders equity until the sale of the hedged oil and gas production 
realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are designated as a hedge and qualify for hedge accounting are generally included in oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged volumes are sold 
however  in the case of the derivatives acquired in connection with our acquisitions of nuevo and tec  only changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date will be reflected in our oil and gas revenues 
as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hedge restructuring  in september we entered into new oil price collars for the period and eliminated approximately of our fixed price crude oil swaps 
by converting fixed price swaps to collars we retained downside protection while potentially capturing significantly higher cash flow 
in addition  we now have certainty of an attractive price range for a meaningful amount of our production for the next several years 
the restructured collars as well as certain other commodity derivative contracts to which we are a party do not qualify for hedge accounting 
consequently  these contracts are marked to market each quarter with changes in fair value recognized currently as a derivative gain or loss on the income statement 
cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making or receiving a payment from the counterparty 
during we recognized a pre tax loss of million from derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the foregoing amount consists of mark to market losses of million and cash settlements of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements derivative instruments and hedging activities for a complete discussion of our hedging activities

the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from independent reporting services compared to the contract price of the agreement  and approximate the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at period end 
all hedge positions offset physical positions exposed to the cash market 
none of these offsetting physical positions are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board increase in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual change in prompt month prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
the contract counterparties for our derivative commodity contracts are all major financial institutions with standard poor s ratings of a or better
