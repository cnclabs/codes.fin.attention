as of december  in thousands consolidated balance sheet data working capital total assets long term debt  including current maturities shareholders equity year ended december  in thousands supplemental data ebitda cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities ebitda means earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we present ebitda to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
ebitda is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations 
in addition  we provide our ebitda because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find ebitda to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the following provides a reconciliation of ebitda to the financial information in our consolidated statement of operations year ended december  in thousands net income loss add back items income taxes interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs depreciation of property  plant and equipment amortization of intangibles total ebitda item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a one stop provider of time critical and technologically complex  multilayer printed circuit boards  which serve as the foundation of sophisticated electronic products 
we serve high end commercial markets including networking communications infrastructure  high end computing and industrial medical which are characterized by high levels of complexity  short product life cycles and moderate production volumes 
our customers include oems and ems companies 
our time to market and high technology focused manufacturing services enable our customers to reduce the time required to develop new products and bring them to market 
the market for our products experienced a sustained downturn during and  due to the economic slowdown in the electronics industry 
during this period  we reduced our work force and focused on cost reduction by improving the efficiency of our operations and negotiating lower prices on key supplies from our vendors 
throughout this period  we generated positive cash flow from operations  added new customers  and continued to invest in our future growth  adding capital equipment and acquiring advanced circuits in december during  we generated increased sales due to the inclusion of advanced circuits  market share gains  and the improving economic conditions in our customers end markets 
our gross profit margin also increased from to  due to our improved operating leverage as costs that are largely fixed in nature  such as labor  were absorbed over greater production volume 
market conditions continued to improve in  resulting in further revenue growth and expanded gross margins 
we manufacture printed circuit boards at three specialized and integrated facilities in the united states 
our facility in santa ana  california  specializes in quick turn work  which has delivery times of ten days or less and is characterized by small volumes of printed circuit boards 
our chippewa falls  wisconsin  facility focuses on higher volume production runs of technologically complex multilayer printed circuit boards with average lead times of two to ten weeks 
our redmond  washington  facility focuses on mid volume production of standard lead time printed circuit boards 
although our facilities are specialized  we are able to transfer work among our plants to maximize production during periods of peak demand 
in response to increased customer demand and higher capacity utilization rates  in february  our board of directors approved a plan to significantly expand production capacity at our chippewa falls  wisconsin  facility 
chippewa falls is our largest facility and serves the high end  complex technology needs of some of our largest and most sophisticated commercial customers 
the plan included a two phase expansion  enabling us to incrementally match our capital expenditures with demand and market conditions 
together  the two phases of the plan represent an increase in production capacity 
all capacity increases described in phases one and two  below  represent cumulative increases from capacity levels as of the first quarter of at year end  we completed phase one  which featured the construction of a  square foot addition and the purchase of capital equipment 
the expansion increased physical capacity by approximately  at a capital cost of approximately million 
while we realized approximately half of this capacity expansion in the second half of  we expect to add employees and realize the remaining capacity over the course of  as necessary  based on demand 
the second phase of the expansion plan will allow us to increase production capacity at the chippewa falls facility by an additional  or a total of  over first quarter capacity levels 
we expect to accomplish this second phase through additional staffing and the purchase of approximately million in capital equipment 
we will proceed with phase two  as warranted  based on demand and market conditions 
once we have decided to proceed  phase two can be completed within three to six months 
we believe that our ability to expand at our existing facilities allows us to efficiently grow without having to qualify customers for  and develop management infrastructure at  a new facility 
we reviewed numerous alternatives to meet our customers needs and believe that this expansion plan provides us with a significant opportunity for growth with relatively limited risk 
however  if our customers demand for our services does not increase to anticipated levels  we may decide to scale back or delay our implementation of phase two of the expansion 
we measure customers as those companies that have placed at least two orders in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately customers and approximately as of december  sales to our largest customers accounted for of our net sales in and of our net sales in we sell to oems both directly and indirectly through ems companies 
sales attributable to our five largest oem customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in the following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated year ended december  end markets networking communication high end computing industrial medical computer peripherals handheld cellular other total sales to ems companies are classified by the end markets of their oem customers 
we measure the time sensitivity of our products by tracking the quick turn percentage of our work 
we define quick turn orders as those with delivery times of days or less  which typically captures research and development  prototype  and new product introduction work  in addition to unexpected short term demand among our customers 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and the time and volume requirements from our customers 
our quick turn services command a premium price as compared to standard lead time products 
quick turn orders declined from of net sales in to of net sales in  due to faster growth in standard lead time products 
we also deliver a large percentage of compressed lead time work with lead times of to days 
we receive a premium price for this work as well 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns  which typically has been less than of gross sales 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards 
we record an amount for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on our historical results 
to the extent actual returns vary from our historical experience  revisions to the allowances may be required 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume and yield 
as of the end of  we were operating at approximately to of our production capacity 
we do not participate in any significant long term supply contracts  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
we believe that our cost of goods sold will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
for example  we experienced a laminate price increase in october that was responsible for an approximate one percent decline in our gross margin in the fourth fiscal quarter selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and commissions paid to independent sales representatives  salaries paid to our sales support staff as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
as general economic conditions continue to improve  we expect to receive more quick turn orders due to increased prototype work and new product introduction among our customers 
as these quick turn sales become a higher percentage of total sales  our average commission rate is expected to increase 
we generally pay higher commissions to our independent sales representatives for quick turn work  which generally has a higher gross profit component than standard lead time work 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  information technologies  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses  expenses for accounting and legal assistance  incentive compensation expense and bad debt expense 
we expect these expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and the requirements of operating as a public company 
amortization of intangibles consists of intangible assets  which we recorded as a result of the power circuits acquisition in july effective january   we no longer record amortization on goodwill 
however  we continue to amortize our definite lived intangible assets  which are primarily comprised of strategic customer relationships 
our restructuring charges in relate primarily to the costs of closing our burlington  washington plant 
the charges primarily included the costs of laying off employees and non cash impairment charges related to the burlington building  property and equipment 
restructuring charges in relate primarily to severance costs to consolidate overhead operations following the acquisition of advanced circuits in december as well as a further write down of assets held for sale 
restructuring charges in relate to the final write down of assets held for sale associated with the sale of the burlington facility 
our interest expense relates to our senior credit facility and our other long term obligations 
amortization of debt issuance costs consists of the amortization of loan origination fees and related expenses 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest received on our cash balances 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies where significant judgments and estimates are made include asset valuation related to bad debts and inventory obsolescence  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  realizability of deferred tax assets  and self insured medical reserves 
a detailed description of these estimates and our policies to account for them is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
our inventory requirements change based on our projected customer demand  which changes due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes and longer or shorter than expected usage periods 
we maintain finished goods inventories near key customer locations in accordance with agreements 
although this inventory is typically supported by valid purchase orders  should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards using customer supplied engineering and design plans and recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
to the extent actual experience varies from our historical experience  revisions to the allowance may be required 
we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and definite lived intangibles 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually 
our goodwill and intangibles are largely attributable to our quick turn business 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis and determined that no impairment existed 
at december   we determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances which indicated that the carrying amount of long lived tangible assets  goodwill and definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are recoverable 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
at december   we have deferred income tax assets of million  which is net of a valuation allowance of approximately million 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to adjust our valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
in addition  we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred income tax assets would be realizable in an amount greater than what is already recorded  we would reverse all or a portion of valuation allowance in the period the determination is made 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
we are self insured for group health insurance benefits provided to our employees  and we purchase insurance to protect against claims at the individual and aggregate level 
the insurance carrier adjudicates and processes employee claims and is paid a fee for these services 
we reimburse our insurance carrier for paid claims subject to variable monthly limitations 
we estimate our exposure for claims incurred but not paid at the end of each reporting period and use historical information supplied by our insurance carrier and broker to estimate our liability for these claims 
this liability is subject to a total limitation that varies based on employee enrollment and factors that are established at each annual contract renewal 
our actual claims experience may differ from our estimates 
in connection with our acquisition of advanced circuits in december  we became contractually responsible for the majority of a rebate obligation to a customer 
the rebate is based on a percentage of net sales to this customer 
we have made estimates regarding the amount and timing of future net sales to this customer and have applied a discount factor to those estimated rebates to estimate the present value of our obligation 
we have also estimated that portion of the total obligation which we believe is a current liability 
based on our future net sales experience with this customer  we may change our estimate of the portion that is a current liability 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs interest income and other  net income loss before income taxes and extraordinary item income tax provision benefit income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary gain net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in due to increases in both price and production volume 
improving prices accounted for approximately of the increase in net sales 
prices improved due to a number of factors  including a continued strengthening of the economy in and a shift in mix to higher technology products 
we generally charge higher prices for printed circuit boards with time sensitive delivery requirements  high layer counts and other high technology features because of both the higher material content and the greater level of skill required to manufacture these boards 
increased production volume accounted for approximately of the increase in net sales from to this volume increase resulted from higher demand from our customers 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million for to million for higher cost of goods sold resulted primarily from higher labor and materials costs associated with an increase in the number of printed circuit boards sold 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for to for due to greater labor and production efficiencies  lower materials costs and improved absorption of manufacturing overhead 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit increased million  or  from million for to million for our gross margin improved from in to in the improvement in our gross margin was due largely to higher prices as well as greater labor efficiency  lower per unit materials costs and increased absorption of fixed costs 
printed circuit board manufacturing is a multi step process that requires a certain level of equipment and staffing for even minimal production volumes 
as production increases  our employees are able to work more efficiently and produce more printed circuit boards without incurring significant cost increases  except for direct materials 
however  at higher capacity utilization rates  additional employees and capital may be required 
these gains in efficiency helped offset the increased costs related to our shift toward more complex work characterized by higher layer counts 
our average layer count increased from in to in operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for to million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses resulted primarily from additional commission expense related to the increase in net sales 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales resulted from improved absorption of fixed selling costs and a mix shift toward products that bear lower commissions 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for to million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses resulted primarily from higher incentive compensation expense  costs related to a proposed public stock offering and higher accounting and consulting fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  partially offset by lower insurance expense and lower legal fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the relatively fixed nature of these expenses and our higher sales base 
restructuring charges of million recorded in related to severance and other exit costs associated with eliminating positions at our redmond  washington  facility and an impairment for our burlington  washington  building 
in  we recorded a restructuring charge of million to write down the value of our burlington  washington  building prior to selling it 
there are no unutilized restructuring accruals at december  income taxes the provision for income taxes increased from a million provision for to a million provision for the increase in the income tax provision resulted primarily from higher pretax income  partially offset by a lower effective tax rate for our effective tax rate was in  and it was in our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by state income taxes  which vary due to the sales and profitability mix among our facilities  as well as utilization of the federal extraterritorial income exclusion  state income tax credits and certain non deductible items 
in addition  during  we decreased our valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets and benefited our income tax provision by million for the portion that we determined that is more likely than not to be realized 
excluding the favorable impact resulting from the decrease in valuation allowance  our effective tax rate in was 
as of december   our valuation allowance was approximately million 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  the effective income tax rate could change due to changes in the mix of income  changes to income tax credits and changes to the valuation allowance 
extraordinary gain in  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million after resolving contingencies concerning the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of our acquisition of advanced circuits  including the settlement of a claim for a working capital adjustment 
see note to our consolidated condensed financial statements for a description of the extraordinary gain 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the full year includes the results of operations of advanced circuits  which was acquired in a stock purchase on december  advanced circuits results of operations are included for six days in net sales net sales increased from million in to million in due to increases in both price and production volume 
improving prices accounted for approximately of the increase in total revenue 
this price improvement was due to a number of factors  including an improving economy in  the shift toward end markets  such as networking and high end computing  that are characterized by faster growth and higher prices  and the increasing complexity of our product offering 
we generally charge higher prices for printed circuit boards with high layer counts and other high technology features because of both the higher material content and the greater level of skill required to manufacture these boards accurately 
increased production volume accounted for approximately of the increase in revenue from to advanced circuits  which we acquired in december  accounted for more than one half of our total net sales for the combined net sales of our remaining facilities declined by approximately due to the closure of our burlington  washington plant in december gross profit cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million in to million in higher cost of goods sold resulted from higher labor  materials and variable overhead costs associated with an increase in the number of printed circuit boards sold 
the volume of boards sold increased due to the acquisition of advanced circuits partially offset by lower aggregate volumes sold at our remaining facilities 
in addition  a reduction in fixed costs due to the closure of our burlington facility favorably impacted our cost structure 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for to for primarily due to improved absorption of manufacturing overhead and greater labor efficiency 
in addition  we benefited from lower unit pricing for our direct materials  partially offset by higher direct materials costs associated with a sales mix shift towards higher layer count boards and expenses associated with our up front investments in in equipment  additional employees and expanded capacity at our redmond facility 
in connection with our acquisition of advanced circuits  no value was assigned to the acquired property and equipment and accordingly  we record no depreciation expense for these acquired assets 
we expect our depreciation expense to increase in the future as a result of our chippewa falls facility expansion 
expenditures for information technology salaries and expenses for have been reclassified to general and administrative expenses to conform to the presentation for this reclassification more appropriately reflects the overall corporate nature of our information technology expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  the reclassification reduced cost of goods sold and increased gross profit by in as a result of the foregoing  gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in our gross margin improved to in from in the improvement in our gross margin was due largely to increased absorption of fixed costs 
printed circuit board manufacturing is a multi step process that requires a certain level of equipment and staffing for even minimal production volumes 
as production increases  our employees are able to work more efficiently and produce more printed circuit boards without incurring significant cost increases 
these gains in efficiency helped offset the increased costs related to our shift in toward more complex work characterized by higher layer count 
our average layer count increased from in to in primarily due to the acquisition of advanced circuits 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  in to million  or of net sales  in the decrease as a percentage of net sales resulted from improved absorption of fixed selling costs and a lower commission rate associated with a mix shift to more standard lead time products due primarily to our acquisition of advanced circuits 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  in to million  or of net sales  in the increase in expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from higher personnel costs principally attributable to our acquisition of advanced circuits  higher corporate governance expenses  principally higher directors and officers liability insurance premiums and accounting and legal fees  increased incentive compensation expense  transition costs to integrate advanced circuits  an increase in the bad debt provision  and higher information technology costs 
information technology salaries and expenses for have been reclassified from cost of goods sold to general and administrative expenses to conform to the presentation for amortization of intangibles was for intangible assets with finite lives from the power circuits acquisition  which occurred in july amortization of intangibles was million in both and during the second quarter of  we reduced our labor force at our burlington  washington  facility 
during the fourth quarter of  we consolidated manufacturing capabilities by closing our burlington  washington facility to better manage and control our business 
as a result  we recorded million in total restructuring charges in these charges included the impairment of the building  property and equipment of million  employee termination and severance of million and other exit costs of million associated with the facility closure 
we terminated a total of employees  who were primarily involved in the manufacturing process 
during the first quarter of  we took a million restructuring charge for severance and other exit charges primarily in connection with the lay off of employees at our redmond  washington facility 
during  we designated building and equipment with a remaining net book value of million as assets held for sale 
during  we reviewed the fair value of the remaining assets held for sale for possible impairment and recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
at december   the carrying value of the remaining assets held for sale was million 
these assets were stated at their estimated fair value less selling costs  and we were actively marketing the assets for sale 
we sold the building in the chart below shows the additions to and utilization of the accrued restructuring charges during the years ended december  and severance other exit charges impairment charge total in thousands charge utilization accrued at december  charge utilization accrued at december  as a result of the reduction in force at our burlington  washington facility in the second quarter of  we realized annualized cost savings of approximately million beginning in the third quarter of we realized annualized cost savings of approximately million beginning in the first quarter of from the closure of burlington  washington facility in the fourth quarter of income taxes the provision for income taxes increased by million from a benefit of million in to a provision of million in the income tax benefit in resulted from a pretax loss before extraordinary item  and the income tax provision in resulted from pretax income before extraordinary item 
our effective income tax rate in was  and it was in our effective income tax rate is primarily impacted by state income taxes  which vary due to the sales and profitability mix among our facilities as well as certain non deductible items 
extraordinary gain in  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million after resolving contingencies concerning the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of our acquisition of advanced circuits  including the settlement of a claim for a working capital adjustment 
in  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million as part of our acquisition of advanced circuits 
the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the cost to purchase advanced circuits  resulting in negative goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the amount of negative goodwill was allocated proportionately to reduce the assigned values of acquired assets except current assets and deferred income taxes 
the remaining unallocated negative goodwill was recorded as an extraordinary gain 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the extraordinary gains 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  proceeds from our public offerings and proceeds from employee exercises of stock options 
our principal uses of cash have been to meet debt service requirements  finance capital expenditures  fund working capital and finance mergers and acquisitions 
we anticipate that these uses will continue to be the principal demands on our cash in the future 
as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million  compared to million as of december  the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to increases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
the following table provides information on future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases  current purchase obligation related to capital expenditures  and other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations our balance sheet reflects these other long term liabilities at their net present value 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  available cash  and amounts available under our senior credit facility will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next months and beyond 
our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond the next months are for other contractual obligations as indicated in our contractual obligations table above and for capital purchases under the proposed second phase of our chippewa falls expansion 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in our operating cash flow of million primarily reflects net income of million  million of depreciation and amortization  a million decrease in deferred income taxes  a million income tax benefit from stock options and a million impairment loss on the sale of a building  partially offset by a net increase in working capital of million  excluding cash and short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in in  we made net purchases of million of property  plant and equipment and a net reduction of million in net short term investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million used in financing activities in our financing net cash flow reflects million in principal repayments on our long term debt partially offset by proceeds of million from employee stock option exercises 
as of december   we have no outstanding long term debt obligations 
we have a committed revolving loan facility of million with a final maturity date of september  we may borrow  repay and reborrow under the revolving loan facility at any time 
the revolving loan bears interest at rates ranging from libor plus to or the alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus to 
the amount added to the libor rate or the alternate base rate varies depending upon the company s leverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
our borrowings under the revolving facility are subject to a borrowing base or formula that is based on our accounts receivable and inventory 
as of december   we had no outstanding revolving loan balances 
we pay quarterly a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused revolving commitment amount 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants customary for this type of financing 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and had million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving loan facility 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and as a result we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
we do have minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to salary expense for a few overseas employees 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not dependent upon moderate changes in the inflation rate as we expect that we will be able to pass along component price increases to our customers 
seasonality we have historically experienced some seasonality in our second and third fiscal quarters in our computer peripherals and consumer electronics products 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt sfas r in the third fiscal quarter  beginning july  under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expects that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
the company has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by the company beginning on january  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect sfas to have a material impact 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the issue s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our senior credit facility bears interest at floating rates 
the revolving loan bears interest ranging from to per annum plus the applicable libor or from to per annum plus the alternate base rate  as defined in the agreement governing the amended and restated credit facility 
a change in interest rates is not expected to materially affect the interest expense to be incurred on this facility during such period 
as of december   we have no outstanding revolving loans
