overview we are an applied genomics company that develops and commercializes proprietary dna based tests for the early detection of cancer 
our first commercial test  pregen plus  is used for screening colorectal cancer  the second leading cause of cancer death in the us and the leading cause of cancer death among non smokers 
since our inception on february   our principal activities have included researching and developing our technologies for colorectal cancer screening  conducting clinical studies to validate our colorectal cancer screening tests  negotiating licenses for intellectual property of others  developing relationships with opinion leaders in the scientific and medical communities  conducting market studies and analyzing alternative approaches for commercializing our technologies  hiring research and clinical personnel  sales personnel  management and other support personnel  raising capital  licensing our proprietary technologies to labcorp and working with labcorp on activities necessary for the commercialization  marketing and sale of pregen plus 
on june   we entered into a license agreement  subsequently amended on january   with labcorp for an exclusive  long term strategic alliance to commercialize pregen plus  our proprietary  non invasive dna based technology for the early detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk population 
pursuant to this agreement  we exclusively licensed to labcorp all us and canadian patents and patent applications owned or exclusively licensed by us relating to our technology through august  followed by a non exclusive license for the life of the patents 
in return for the license  labcorp agreed to pay us certain up front and per test royalty fees 
labcorp made an initial payment of million upon the signing of the agreement  and a second payment of million was made in august upon the commercial launch of pregen plus 
in addition to the per test royalty fee  under our amended license agreement  we may also be eligible for milestone payments from labcorp totaling up to million based upon company deliverables related to the acceptance and inclusion of pregen plus in certain clinical guidelines and certain policy level reimbursement approvals from third party payors  as well as performance based payments totaling up to million based upon the achievement of certain significant labcorp revenue thresholds 
the amended license agreement also clarified the obligations of each party with respect to certain third party technology which has been incorporated into the commercial version of the pregen plus test 
in conjunction with the strategic alliance  we issued to labcorp a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock  exercisable over a three year period at an exercise price of per share 
we assigned a value to the warrant of million under the black scholes option pricing model which was recorded as a reduction in the initial up front deferred license fee of million 
we are amortizing the two up front payments totaling million  net of the million value of the warrant  as license fee revenue over the exclusive license period 
we have generated limited operating revenues since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have historically resulted from costs incurred in conjunction with our research and development initiatives  salaries and benefits associated with the hiring of additional personnel  and more recently  the initiation of marketing programs and the build out of our sales infrastructure to support the commercialization and marketing of pregen plus 
we expect that our losses will continue for the next several years as a result of continuing research  development  sales and marketing expenses 
our future revenues will depend  in large part  upon whether our technologies are broadly ordered by medical practitioners  requested by patients  and ultimately reimbursed by third party payors 
we believe that the market demand for our first commercial product  pregen plus  which is being sold through labcorp  is dependent upon a number of factors  including the following inclusion of stool based dna screening in colorectal cancer screening guidelines  formal acceptance of stool based dna screening for reimbursement by medicare and other third party payors  patient acceptance of pregen plus  including its novel sample collection process  stool based dna screening becoming a standard of care among prescribing physicians  the impact the publication of our multi center study results and accompanying editorial in a peer reviewed journal have on market acceptance of pregen plus and effective sales processes to educate physicians and their office staff to facilitate patient compliance 
our revenue is comprised of product royalty fees on pregen plus tests sold by labcorp  product revenue from the sale to labcorp of certain components of our effipure technology  which is incorporated into the pregen plus test  and the amortization of license fees for the licensing of product rights to labcorp under our license agreements 
we account for pregen plus royalty fees on a cash basis and will continue to do so until such time as we have sufficient history and experience to estimate the percentage of pregen plus accessions that will ultimately result in revenue for us 
laboratory operating factors incurred at labcorp such as turnaround times for the testing process  possible pre and post analytical sample deficiencies and third party reimbursement all influence whether an accession by labcorp will eventually be recognized as revenue by us 
we recognize our license fee revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable exclusive license period 
we expect that product royalty fees and product revenue will increase in on an aggregate basis as compared to due to the ongoing commercial sales of pregen plus by labcorp 
license fee revenue for is expected to be consistent with license fee revenue recorded in due to the ratable recognition of upfront license fees received from labcorp 
research and development expenses include costs related to scientific and laboratory personnel  research and clinical studies and reagents and supplies used in the development of our technologies 
our research and development efforts in will focus on improving the sensitivity and other performance aspects of pregen plus and thus we do not expect to engage in large scale clinical trials 
we expect research and development expenses to decrease in from levels as we plan on allocating more resources to sales and marketing efforts than in previous years 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses and professional fees 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to be flat in as compared however  we do expect a shift in the allocation of spending which will result in higher sales and marketing expenses as we supplement the direct sales efforts of labcorp and implement marketing initiatives in certain regions of the us and lower headcount and professional fees in the general and administrative functions 
stock based compensation expense  a non cash expense  primarily represents the difference between the exercise price and fair value of common stock on the date of grant for certain options granted prior to our initial public offering as well as charges resulting from stock option grants to non employees which are recorded at fair value based on the fair value measurement criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the stock based compensation expense related to options granted prior to our initial public offering is being amortized on an accelerated method over the vesting period of the applicable options  which is generally months  and will end in the amount of stock based compensation expense that we record each quarter in connection with options granted to non employees may fluctuate with changes in our stock price 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach to accounting for share based payments in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure of the fair value of share based payments is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies excluding small business issuers at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material effect on our financial statements  in the form of additional compensation expense  on a quarterly and annual basis 
it is not possible to precisely determine the expense impact of adoption since a portion of the ultimate expense that is recorded will likely relate to awards that have not yet been granted  but are likely to be granted prior to the july  adoption date 
the expense associated with these future awards can only be determined based on factors such as the price of our common stock  the volatility of our stock price and risk free interest rates as measured at the grant date 
however  the pro forma disclosures related to sfas no 
included in our historic financial statements are relevant data points for gauging the potential level of expense that might be recorded in future periods 
significant accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was issued in december by the securities and exchange commission  requires all registrants to discuss critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
further  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and actual results may differ from those estimates 
the areas that require the greatest degree of management judgment are the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets  primarily intellectual property  and revenue recognition 
patent costs 
patent costs  which consist of related legal fees and disbursements and purchases of intellectual property  are capitalized as incurred and are amortized beginning when patents are issued in the united states over an estimated useful life of five years 
capitalized patent costs are expensed upon disallowance of the patent  or upon a decision by us to no longer pursue the patent  or when the related intellectual property is deemed to be no longer of value to us 
revenue recognition 
license fees for the licensing of product rights on initiation of strategic agreements are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the license period 
royalties fees earned on pregen plus tests performed by labcorp are based upon the customer s remittance to labcorp  not the amount billed 
service revenue is recognized when services are performed earned  amounts can be objectively determined measurable  and collection is reasonably assured collectible or realizable 
until such time that estimates utilized are supported by measurable  historical remittance data  we will recognize royalties as labcorp customers make payments 
the timing of payments is uncertain because of the number of parties involved in the reimbursement process 
product revenue from the sale of certain components of our effipure technology to labcorp is recognized upon shipment of the components provided that title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is probable 
revenue from milestone and other performance based payments will be recognized as revenue when the milestone or performance is achieved and collection of the receivable is estimable and probable 
we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the periods presented 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue is primarily composed of amortization of up front technology license fees associated with agreements signed with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the license period 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the amortization of the second million up front license fee received upon the commercial launch of pregen plus in august as well as an increase in revenues related to sales of effipure components to labcorp 
cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the cost of product revenue includes the costs of effipure components while the cost of product royalty revenue represents royalties owed to third parties for technology currently incorporated into pregen plus 
the increase in the cost of product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of an increase in the number of effipure components shipped to labcorp 
in addition  we recorded charges of approximately  during to write off excess and expired effipure inventory units 
we have contractual commitments to certain of our effipure contract manufacturers which require us to pay minimum aggregate dollar amounts over the life of the commitments  which expire in april a portion of the charges to write off excess and expired effipure inventory units was based upon payments related to these minimum purchase commitments 
as we fulfill these minimum purchase commitments  we may need to make additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory 
for the year ended december   product cost of sales primarily represented the cost of performing commercial colorectal screening tests at our facilities 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the completion of our multi center study in the fourth quarter of and the completion of certain other research and development initiatives in to support of the commercialization of pregen plus 
included in the decrease in research and development expenses were decreases of million in laboratory expenses  million in personnel related expenses  million in clinical study expenses and  in professional fees 
also included in the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was a decrease of  in laboratory space costs as a result of the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements recorded in associated with our former facility 
the decreases noted above were partially offset by an increase of  in severance costs associated with the termination of certain officers and employees during the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information on employee terminations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the completion of programs related to the pre marketing of pregen plus which ended in resulting in lower professional fees and expenses of million as well as a decrease in facility related expenses of  these decreases were partially offset by an increase of  in severance costs in connection with the termination of certain officers and employees during see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information on employee terminations 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense  decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in stock based compensation was primarily due to the accelerated method of amortization being utilized to amortize the deferred compensation recorded in connection with options granted prior to our initial public offering 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we recorded  of stock based compensation associated with our agreement to forgive an outstanding loan of a former executive officer  which was offset by a reduction of  in stock based compensation associated with the forfeitures of restricted stock and the cancellation of unvested stock options due to the departure of certain officers and employees 
interest income 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during as compared to as a result of the completion of our public offering of million shares of common stock in february  which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  revenue is primarily composed of amortization of up front technology license fees associated with agreements signed in july and june with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the respective license periods 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the cost of product revenue includes the costs of effipure components sold to labcorp as well as the estimated cost of performing commercial colorectal screening tests at our facilities while the cost of product royalty fees represents royalties owed to third parties for technology currently incorporated into pregen plus 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the completion of our  patient multi center study which was initiated in october and included a decrease of million in trials and studies expenses partially offset by increases of  in personnel related expenses   in professional fees and expenses   in laboratory expenses  and  related to the leasing of additional laboratory space 
the increase in the expenses noted above were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of tests being performed in support of our multi center study and the mayo clinic study  in addition to other research and development initiatives undertaken to further develop our technologies in support of the commercial launch of pregen plus 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to increases in sales personnel and marketing programs in support of the commercial launch of pregen plus and included increases of million in personnel related expenses  million in professional fees and expenses   in travel related expenses and  related to office space and related office expenses 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  a non cash expense  decreased to million for the year ended december   of which  related to research and development personnel and  related to general and administrative personnel from million for the year ended december  the decrease in stock based compensation in from is due to the accelerated method of amortization being used to record this expense 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on our investments and overall decreases in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
employee terminations on february   we reduced our workforce by ten employees  principally in the research and development functions 
employees terminated were eligible to receive three to four months of salary and benefits  depending on their position and length of service with the company 
in connection with the employee terminations  we expect to record severance charges ranging from to in the quarter ended march  with the completion of our  patient multi center study in  and with no large clinical studies anticipated in the near term  we determined that a reduction in force was warranted to reduce costs 
this workforce reduction reflects our intention to validate product improvements through smaller  less expensive research studies that leverage the results of our prior studies including our large scale multi center study that was published in the new england journal of medicine in december liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of preferred stock  our initial public offering of common stock in february  cash received from labcorp in connection with our strategic alliance and a public offering of million shares of common stock in february as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  of which approximately million has been pledged as collateral for an outstanding letter of credit 
all of our investments in marketable securities are comprised of fixed income investments and all are deemed available for sale 
the objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the upfront deferred licensing fees from labcorp  net cash used in operating activities would have been million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on this basis  the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the decrease in our operating loss  which was the result of lower research and development spending due to the completion of our  patient multi center study in late  partially offset by approximately million in severance costs associated with the termination of certain employees and officers during the increase in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the increase in our operating loss  which was the result of higher research and development spending during our  patient multi center study as well as an increases in selling  general and administrative expenses to support the commercial launch of pregen plus in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in and net cash used by investing activities of million in excluding the impact of the purchases and maturities of marketable securities  net cash used in investing activities was  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment of  during were significantly lower than purchases of property and equipment of million in and million in investment in property and equipment in was related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters and lab operations to marlborough  massachusetts while the investment in related to the expansion of our laboratory operations to prepare for our multi center study and the mayo clinic study 
we expect that purchases of property and equipment in will be consistent with amounts spent in cash used for the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio was  for the year ended december   as compared to  in and  in patent costs  which historically consisted of related legal fees  are capitalized as incurred and are amortized beginning when patents are issued in the united states over an estimated useful life of five years 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million in and  in in february  we completed an offering of million shares of our common stock which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million 
also in  issuances of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans and the repayment of notes receivable provided an additional  in cash to us 
during the years ended december  and  issuances of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans and the repayment of notes receivable provided million and  respectively  in cash flows from financing activities 
we expect that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments currently on hand at december   will be sufficient to fund our operations for the at least the next two years  based upon our current operating outlook 
product royalty fee payments and milestone payments from labcorp may supplement our liquidity position 
however  as we are in the early stage of commercialization of pregen plus  we cannot forecast how rapidly sales of pregen plus and  consequently  royalty payments from labcorp  will increase  if at all 
further  milestone and other performance based payments from labcorp for which we may be eligible under our strategic agreement may supplement our liquidity position 
however  the timing and receipt of milestone and performance based payments is similarly unpredictable at this time 
of the remaining million of payments for which we may be eligible under our amended agreement with labcorp  million relates to milestone payments associated with the inclusion of pregen plus into certain clinical guideline acceptance and policy level reimbursement approvals that  in large part  depend upon decisions to be made by third parties  and million relates to the achievement of certain significant cumulative labcorp revenue thresholds that depend upon labcorp s success with respect to its sales of pregen plus and are not expected for the next several years  if at all 
as such  no assurance can be given that any payments pursuant to our agreement with labcorp will be sufficient or timely enough to meet our liquidity needs 
if revenue and other payments from labcorp are insufficient to meet our liquidity needs  we will be required to raise additional capital or reduce the scale of our operations 
our shelf registration statement on form s filed with the sec was declared effective on september   which permits us to offer  from time to time  any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase each of the foregoing  up to an aggregate of million 
on february   we completed an offering of million shares of common stock under this shelf registration statement which generated net proceeds of million 
while we may  from time to time  seek to access the capital markets  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any future capital raising efforts  or that we would be able raise additional funds at an acceptable price level 
the table below reflects our estimated fixed obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations     purchase obligations obligations under license and collaborative agreements   total      operating leases reflect remaining obligations associated with leased facilities in marlborough and maynard  massachusetts 
effective january   we amended the lease for our corporate headquarters in marlborough to reduce the total space leased at that facility from approximately  square feet to approximately  square feet 
in connection with this lease amendment  we expect to write off approximately in the quarter ended march   relating to leasehold improvements to the space being vacated 
in addition  we expect to save approximately million in lease costs over the remaining term of the lease as a result of this amendment 
the fixed obligation and commitments table above reflects this lease amendment 
purchase obligations represent purchase commitments associated with the manufacture and production of effipure 
obligations under license and collaboration agreements represent on going commitments under various research collaborations and licensing agreements 
commitments under license agreements generally expire concurrent with the expiration of the intellectual property licensed from the third party 
we do not have any special purpose entities or any other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued investment in our research and development programs and related initiatives  supporting research and clinical study efforts on our technologies  sales and marketing efforts associated with the commercialization of pregen plus  capital expenditures primarily associated with purchases of laboratory equipment and continued investment in our intellectual property estate 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of our applied research efforts and clinical studies  the inclusion of stool dna screening in colorectal cancer screening guidelines  formal acceptance of stool dna screening for reimbursement by medicare and other third party payors  our ability to achieve milestones under our strategic agreement with labcorp the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities and the successful commercialization and sales growth of pregen plus 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that we will be able to liquidate our investments or obtain financing when needed or desirable 
an inability to fund our operations would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation s utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income within the next two years in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate 
factors that may affect future results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
this discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 
we may never successfully commercialize any of our technologies or become profitable 
we have incurred losses since we were formed and have had only modest product and royalty fee revenues since product introduction in august from our date of inception on february  through december   we have accumulated a total deficit of approximately million 
we expect that our losses will continue for the next several years as a result of continuing research and development expenses  as well as increased sales and marketing expenses 
if our revenue does not grow significantly to offset these expenses  we will not be profitable 
we cannot assure you that the revenue from the sale of any of our technologies will be sufficient to make us profitable 
our future revenues will depend  in large part  upon whether our technologies are broadly ordered by medical practitioners  requested by patients  and ultimately reimbursed by third party payors 
we believe that the market demand for our first commercial product  pregen plus  which is being sold through labcorp  is dependent upon a number of factors  including the following inclusion of stool based dna screening in colorectal cancer screening guidelines  formal acceptance of stool based dna screening for reimbursement by medicare and other third party payors  patients acceptance of pregen plus  including its novel sample collection process  stool based dna screening becoming a standard of care among prescribing physicians  the impact the publication of our multi center study results and accompanying editorial in a peer reviewed journal have on market acceptance of pregen plus and effective sales processes to educate physicians and their office staff to facilitate patient compliance 
many of these factors are outside our control and  accordingly  we cannot assure you that one or more of the foregoing will occur in the near term  or at all 
failure to achieve one or more of the foregoing events could substantially impair our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability and will negatively impact the successful commercialization of pregen plus 
our ability to generate revenue depends on labcorp s and our commercial sales of pregen plus 
pursuant to our exclusive license agreement with labcorp  our current operating revenue is primarily dependent upon labcorp s commercial sales of pregen plus 
although we are actively working together with labcorp on initiatives designed to promote our joint success with regard to pregen plus  we cannot assure you that we or labcorp will be successful in achieving sufficient sales of pregen plus for us to become profitable 
such initiatives include the following physician and consumer education and demand  implementation of marketing and sales initiatives and programs  broad based reimbursement initiatives  advocacy development  sales force training and contracting with manufacturers and suppliers 
if we or labcorp are unsuccessful in our efforts with respect to one or more of the foregoing initiatives  our revenues could be materially adversely affected 
moreover  given the number of products that labcorp sells  we cannot assure you that labcorp will devote the resources and attention necessary to make pregen plus commercially successful 
any failure of the labcorp sales force or our sales and marketing employees  in whole or in part  to give continued and sustained focus to pregen plus would harm the demand creation for pregen plus and  in turn  could materially adversely effect our revenues and delay any performance based payments for which we might otherwise be eligible under our strategic agreement with labcorp 
any change in the senior management or organizational structure within labcorp or exact sciences  could negatively impact our ability to successfully commercialize pregen plus 
further  laboratory operating factors incurred at labcorp such as turnaround times for the testing process  possible pre and post analytical sample deficiencies  and efforts to obtain third party reimbursement all influence the rate of market adoption of pregen plus 
if labcorp encounters difficulty performing pregen plus tests on an accurate and timely basis or has difficulty obtaining reimbursement  our revenue could be materially and adversely affected 
future demand for the pregen plus test may require labcorp to further optimize operational and quality assurance processes to support commercial testing 
no assurance can be given that such improvements will be successfully implemented by labcorp  and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues 
our business is substantially dependent on the success of our strategic relationship with labcorp 
we have a strategic alliance with labcorp  under which we licensed to labcorp certain of our technologies that are required for the commercialization of pregen plus  a proprietary  non invasive dna based screening test for the early detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk population 
the license to labcorp is exclusive within the united states and canada for a five year term followed by a non exclusive license for the life of the underlying patents 
labcorp has the ability to terminate this agreement for  among other things  a material breach by us 
if labcorp were to terminate the agreement  fail to meet its obligations under the agreement or otherwise decrease its commitment to pregen plus  our revenues would be materially adversely affected  the commercialization of pregen plus would be interrupted and we could become insolvent 
further  we cannot guarantee that we would be able to enter into a similar agreement with another company to commercialize this technology 
moreover  if we do not achieve certain milestones  or labcorp does not achieve certain revenue and performance thresholds within the time periods prescribed in the agreement  we may not fully realize the expected benefits of the agreement to us 
in january  we and labcorp amended our license agreement  to among other things  restructure certain product development milestones and increase the level of our collaboration on sales and product enhancement initiatives 
although this amendment does not change the million of total milestone payments that we may be eligible to receive under the agreement  the amendment makes it more difficult for us to fully realize these payments if labcorp is unable to achieve significant revenue thresholds with respect to its sales of pregen plus or if we are unable to obtain clinical guideline acceptance and policy level reimbursement approvals for pregen plus 
moreover  we cannot assure you that this amendment or other strategic initiatives with labcorp will accomplish the long term goals of either party 
if one or more additional amendments to our agreement with labcorp become necessary as a result of the continuing evolution of pregen plus  developments in our relationship with labcorp or otherwise  we cannot assure you that any such amendment could be entered into on more favorable terms  if at all 
we cannot effectively control whether labcorp will devote sufficient resources to pregen plus under our strategic agreement or whether it will elect to pursue the development or commercialization of competing products or services 
disagreements with labcorp could delay or terminate the continued commercialization of pregen plus by labcorp or result in litigation or arbitration  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  if we are unsuccessful in managing our strategic relationship with labcorp  we would be required to enter into other strategic relationships for the commercialization of pregen plus or commercialize the test ourselves 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to license our technology to another commercial laboratory or otherwise successfully commercialize the technology  and our failure to do either of the foregoing would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues 
our business would suffer if we are unable to license certain technologies or obtain raw materials and components or if certain of our licenses were terminated 
the current configuration of pregen plus that we have commercialized with labcorp requires access to certain technologies and supplies of raw materials  including components for our effipure technology  for which licensing and supply agreements are required 
there can be no assurance that we  or labcorp  can obtain these technologies and raw materials on acceptable terms  if at all 
any such licenses may require us to pay royalties or other fees to third parties  which would have an adverse effect on our revenues or gross margin 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any current contractual arrangements between us and third parties  us and labcorp  or between our strategic partners and other third parties  will be continued  or not breached or terminated early  or that we or our strategic partners will be able to enter into any future relationships necessary to the continued commercial sale of pregen plus or necessary to our realization of material revenues 
any failure to obtain necessary technologies or raw materials would require pregen plus to be re configured which could negatively impact its commercial sale and increase the costs associated with pregen plus  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and gross margin  respectively 
the time and attention of our management team may be diverted from domestic sales and operational issues if opportunities in foreign markets are pursued 
our license with labcorp is exclusive in north america and canada and we have the ability to license our technologies for colorectal cancer screening in other markets beyond these territories 
our success materially depends upon our management team devoting adequate time and attention to sales and operational issues within the united states 
in the event we enter into business relationships with entities abroad  there can be no assurance that our management team will be able to continue to devote the time and attention necessary to adequately manage and support domestic initiatives 
if our clinical studies do not prove the superiority of pregen plus  we may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of physicians to order  and third party payors to pay for tests based on pregen plus 
if the results of our research and clinical studies do not convince third party payors  physicians  thought leaders and colorectal cancer screening guideline writers of the clinical value of pregen plus  we may never successfully commercialize pregen plus and  as a consequence  we may not be able to remain a viable business 
in  we completed our multi center study of our pregen plus technology that included approximately  asymptomatic  average risk patients aged and older from over academic and community based medical practices 
the goal of this study was to provide additional data supporting the superiority of tests utilizing our technology versus the most widely used brand of fobt  hemoccult ii  in detecting colorectal cancer in this average risk population 
although this study achieved its primary endpoint of showing that our original  bead based dna capture version of pregen plus was more sensitive than hemoccult ii  the point sensitivity from our multi center study was lower than that seen in our previous research and clinical studies 
accordingly  we and labcorp may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of third party payors to pay for tests using our technologies which could slow the demand for the pregen plus test and adversely and materially impact revenues and profitability 
in october  mayo clinic initiated a study of the bead based version of our pregen plus test that was intended to include approximately  patients at average risk for developing colorectal cancer 
this three year study  similar to our multi center study  was designed to compare the results of our bead based technologies with those of the hemoccult ii  a common first line colorectal cancer screening option 
after this study commenced  hemoccult sensa  another brand of fobt  was added to the study 
subsequently  we and the mayo clinic sought to include exact sciences effipure technology in the study  rather than our older  bead based technology 
in connection with this technology transition  mayo clinic reviewed preliminary data from the study which showed that  while pregen plus was nearly twice as sensitive as hemoccult ii and as sensitive as hemoccult sensa in detecting screen relevant neoplasia a category that includes high grade displasia  invasive cancer  and adenomas cm  hemoccult ii and hemoccult sensa appeared to have outperformed  at a preliminary stage  the older  bead based version of our technology in the detection of cancer among the thirteen cancer samples collected in the study 
while we believe that the sample collection protocols used in this study  which were the same as those used in our multi center study  resulted in dna degradation that  in turn  resulted in lower sensitivity of our technology than that demonstrated in our prior published studies  this preliminary data is susceptible to varying interpretations that could negatively impact the market acceptance of our technologies 
moreover  although we believe that the preliminary data from the mayo clinic study is clinically inconclusive given the small sample size of significant colorectal lesions and the dna degradation that resulted from the sample collection methods used in the study  thought leading gastroenterologists and primary care physicians may be reluctant to order tests using our technologies based on this preliminary data  which would materially harm our business and materially adversely affect our revenues 
there is additional risk that thought leading gastroenterologists  guidelines organizations  primary care physicians and others may  despite the small sample size referenced above  assign disproportionate significance to this preliminary data  if published by the nci and or mayo clinic  which may significantly adversely affect commercialization 
although we may work with mayo clinic in the future on studies involving our newer technologies  we cannot assure you that we will reach an agreement with mayo clinic regarding acceptable study protocols or that the nci will agree to fund such a study 
if the nci declines to fund a study with us  we may decide to devote considerable financial resources to such a study on our own  which could harm our results of operations 
moreover  if we cannot work with mayo clinic on a study of our technologies  under study protocols that are mutually acceptable to us and mayo clinic  such an outcome could materially harm the ability of pregen plus to be included in colorectal cancer screening guidelines  to obtain adequate third party reimbursement  or to achieve market acceptance 
if the results of our clinical studies  including the results of a mayo clinic study  do not show that tests using our technologies are superior to existing screening methods  including hemoccult ii and hemoccult sensa  or show that our tests are superior but not by a large enough margin to affect prevailing clinical practice  we may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of physicians to order  and third party payors to pay for tests using our technologies  which could slow the demand for  and successful commercialization of  pregen plus 
if medicare and other third party payors  including managed care organizations  do not provide adequate reimbursement for pregen plus  the commercial success of pregen plus could be compromised 
many physicians may decide not to order colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies unless the tests are adequately reimbursed by third party payors  including medicare  and covered by managed care organizations 
there is significant uncertainty concerning third party reimbursement for the use of any test incorporating new technology 
reimbursement by a third party payor may depend on a number of factors  including a payor s determination that tests using our technologies are sensitive for colorectal cancer  not experimental or investigational  medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient  and cost effective 
while we and labcorp have had some success in obtaining reimbursement from third party payors for tests performed to date  neither we nor labcorp has secured any broad based policy level reimbursement approval from medicare or a sufficient amount of third party payors to ensure the long term commercial success of pregen plus 
if pregen plus cannot be effectively sold at a price acceptable to the market  we may not be able to successfully commercialize pregen plus 
the success of pregen plus depends  in material part  on the ability of labcorp to price the test at a level acceptable to consumers  physicians  and third party payors 
currently  screening for colorectal using our technology is more expensive than fobt because it is labor intensive and uses highly complex processes and expensive reagents 
in order to make our technologies less costly and more commercially attractive to consumers  physicians and third party payors  we or labcorp will need to reduce the costs of tests using our technologies through significant automation of key operational processes or other cost savings procedures 
there can be no assurance that such parties  including medicare  will pay for pregen plus at levels that will enable us to earn a profit  if at all 
if we or labcorp fail to create and improve technologies that sufficiently reduce costs  labcorp s sales of pregen plus and  as a result  our revenues may be limited 
moreover  if we and labcorp are unable to sell a sufficient number of tests at favorable pricing levels  we will not be successful and we may not be able to remain viable as a company 
if our effipure technology and our or labcorp s other technological advancements do not increase the performance of pregen plus in a cost effective manner  the demand for pregen plus may be negatively impacted 
we continue to work to improve the performance characteristics of pregen plus through research on technical innovations such as our effipure technology 
however  there can be no assurance that future generations of pregen plus  or the commercial version of the pregen plus test currently offered by labcorp  which incorporates effipure and other technology improvements  will have sufficient sensitivity or performance to be commercially successful 
we have conducted studies of the pregen plus test  which included our effipure technology 
these studies  which have consisted of cohorts from previously conducted clinical studies  including the multi center study  have shown that the pregen plus test  which includes effipure  detected cancer in additional samples that the original bead based version of our technology did not 
however  the number of samples in each of these studies has been small and the ranges of sensitivity improvement with effipure have been broad  thus making it difficult to definitively quantify the increase in sensitivity of the pregen plus test including effipure  as compared to the original bead based test 
if future generations of the pregen plus test  or the commercial version of the pregen plus test with effipure  does not significantly increase the sensitivity or performance over that of the original bead based technology in a cost effective manner  we may never achieve the expected demand for tests using our technologies or such demand could be significantly reduced  either of which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
if an insufficient number of medical practitioners order tests using our technologies  our revenue and profitability may be limited 
if we  or labcorp  fail to convince a sufficient number of medical practitioners to order tests using our technologies  we will not be able to create sufficient demand for tests using our technologies in sufficient volume for us to become profitable 
an important element to the successful commercialization of pregen plus is the inclusion of the test in colorectal cancer screening guidelines 
we and labcorp will need to make gastroenterologists and primary care physicians aware of the benefits of tests using our technologies through published papers  presentations at scientific conferences  favorable results from clinical studies and obtaining reimbursement from insurers 
our failure to be successful in these efforts or to be included within colorectal cancer screening guidelines would make it difficult for us  or labcorp  to convince medical practitioners to order colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies for their patients which could materially adversely affect our revenues 
we may experience limits on our revenue and profitability if only a small number of people decide to be screened for colorectal cancer using our technologies 
even if our technologies are superior to other colorectal cancer screening options  adequate third party reimbursement is obtained and we convince medical practitioners to order tests using our technologies  only a small number of people may decide to be screened for colorectal cancer 
despite the availability of current colorectal cancer screening methods as well as the recommendations of the american cancer society that all americans over the age of be screened for colorectal cancer  most of these individuals do not complete a colorectal cancer screening test 
if only a small portion of the recommended population is regularly screened for colorectal cancer or decides to utilize colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies  we will  despite our efforts  experience limits on our revenue and profitability 
if we or our partners fail to comply with fda requirements  we may be limited or restricted in our ability to market our products and services and may be subject to stringent penalties 
the fda does not actively regulate laboratory tests that are developed and used by a laboratory to conduct in house testing 
the fda does regulate specific reagents and certain components  some of which are used with our technologies and react with a biological substance including those designed to identify a specific dna sequence or protein 
for instance  a key component of our technologies includes our effipure technology for the recovery of dna from biological samples 
the fda s regulations provide that most such reagents  which the fda refers to as analyte specific reagents  or asrs  are exempt from the fda s pre market review requirements 
we believe the asrs that we provide currently fall within these exemptions 
however  if the fda were to decide to more actively regulate in house developed laboratory tests  or significantly change the regulations for asrs  commercial sales of pregen plus and the sale of effipure components to labcorp could be delayed  halted or prevented 
if the fda were to view any of our or labcorp s actions as non compliant  it could initiate enforcement action  which could involve criminal or civil penalties 
moreover  while we believe that effipure qualifies as an asr  and is therefore exempt from the fda s pre market review requirements  there can be no assurance that the fda or other regulatory bodies will agree with our assessment and the commercialization of our products and services could be impacted by being delayed  halted or prevented altogether 
finally  any asrs that we provide will be subject to a number of fda requirements  including compliance with restrictions regarding performance claims as well as the fda s quality system regulation  which establishes extensive regulations for quality assurance and control as well as manufacturing procedures 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in enforcement action against us  our partners  or our contract manufacturers 
adverse fda action in any of these areas could significantly increase our expenses and limit our revenue and profitability 
we may be subject to substantial costs and liability or be prevented from selling our screening tests for cancer as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent rights 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against our licensors  our licensees  our suppliers  our strategic partners  or us 
we pursue a patent strategy that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the non invasive early detection of colorectal cancer and is designed to maximize our patent protection against third parties in the us and in foreign countries 
we have filed patent applications that we believe cover methods we have designed to detect colorectal cancer and other cancers  including our testing process 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may have to initiate actions against third parties 
any actions regarding patents could be costly and time consuming  and divert our management and key personnel from our business 
additionally  such actions could result in challenges to the validity or applicability of our patents 
because the us patent trademark office maintains patent applications in secrecy until a patent application publishes or the patent is issued  others may have filed patent applications covering technology used by us or our partners 
additionally  there may be third party patents  patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our technologies that may block or compete with our technologies 
even if third party claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit may result in substantial expense to us and may divert the attention of management and key personnel 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that we would prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies  if any  awarded against us would not be substantial 
claims of intellectual property infringement may require that we  or our strategic partners  enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
these claims may also result in injunctions against the further development and commercial sale of pregen plus  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  patents and applications owned by us may become the subject of interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost to us  as well as a possible adverse decision as to the priority of invention of the patent or patent application involved 
an adverse decision in an interference proceeding may result in the loss of rights under a patent or patent application subject to such a proceeding 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively  we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property  which would impair our competitive advantage 
we rely on patent protection as well as a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret protection  and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies  all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  we will be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies and they will be able to compete more effectively against us 
as of december   we have issued patents  allowed patent applications and pending patent applications in the united states and we also have issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications 
we cannot assure you that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents  and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be issued 
further  we cannot assure you that other parties will not challenge any patents issued to us  or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid or enforceable 
a third party institution is a co owner of one of our issued patents relating to pooling patient samples in connection with our loss of heterozygosity detection method 
we cannot guarantee you that we will be successful in defending challenges made in connection with our patents and patent applications 
any successful third party challenge to our patents could result in co ownership of such patents with a third party or the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents 
in addition  we and a third party institution have filed a joint patent application that is co owned by us and that third party institution relating to the use of various dna markers  including one of our detection methods  to detect cancers of the lung  pancreas  esophagus  stomach  small intestine  bile duct  naso pharyngeal  liver and gall bladder in stool under the patent cooperation treaty 
this patent application designates the united states  japan  europe and canada 
co ownership of a patent allows the co owner to exercise all rights of ownership  including the right to use  transfer and license the rights protected by the applicable patent 
in addition to our patents  we rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
we require our employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements and employees to sign agreements assigning to us all intellectual property arising from their work for us 
nevertheless  we cannot guarantee that these measures will be effective in protecting our intellectual property rights 
we cannot guarantee that the patents issued to us will be broad enough to provide any meaningful protection nor can we assure you that one of our competitors may not develop more effective technologies  designs or methods to test for colorectal cancer or any other common cancer without infringing our intellectual property rights or that one of our competitors might not design around our proprietary technologies 
if we become subject to additional regulations from the us department of transportation  or other domestic and international regulatory agencies  for the transport of diagnostic specimens  it could increase the cost of transporting stool specimens and limit revenue growth 
on august   the us department of transportation  or dot  issued revised hazardous materials regulations for the packaging and transport of infectious materials  including diagnostic specimens 
in anticipation of the application of these regulations to our current specimen container and transport system  we submitted an exemption request to the dot to minimize the changes that would be necessary for our specimen collection system  while still providing an equivalent level of safety 
on february   the dot issued a formal determination that stool samples intended for clinical research or diagnostic purposes would not be deemed an infectious substance subject to the hazardous materials regulations 
while this decision is favorable  we cannot be certain that the dot  or other domestic and international regulatory agencies  will not more actively regulate or restrict the transportation of stool samples  such as those used in our diagnostic tests 
any regulation or restriction on the transportation of stool samples used in the pregen plus test could require us to make time consuming and costly changes to the specimen collection system which could materially adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
other companies may develop and market novel or improved methods for detecting colorectal cancer  which may make our technologies less competitive  or even obsolete 
the market for colorectal cancer screening is large  approximating million americans age and above  of which over million fail to follow the american cancer society s screening guidelines 
as a result  the colorectal cancer screening market has attracted competitors  some of which have significantly greater resources than we have 
currently  we face competition from procedure based detection technologies such as flexible sigmoidoscopy  colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy  a new procedure being performed in which a radiologist views the inside of the colon through a scanner  as well as existing and possibly improved traditional screening tests such as immunochemical fobt 
in addition  some companies are developing serum based tests  or screening tests based on the detection of proteins or nucleic acids produced by colon cancer in the blood including proteomics in which protein patterns are analyzed for links to disease 
these and other companies may also be working on additional methods of detecting colon cancer that have not yet been announced 
we may be unable to compete effectively against these competitors either because their test is superior or because they may have more expertise  experience  financial resources and stronger business relationships 
we rely on third party contract manufacturers and suppliers and may experience a scarcity of raw materials and components 
we rely on contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain components for our technologies 
we believe that there are relatively few manufacturers that are currently capable of supplying commercial quantities of the raw materials and components necessary for the current configuration of the pregen plus test  including our effipure technology 
although we have identified suppliers that we believe are capable of supplying these raw materials and components in sufficient quantity today  there can be no assurance that we  or labcorp  will be able to enter into or maintain agreements with such suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms  if at all 
furthermore  prior to august  pregen plus had never been offered on a commercial scale  and there can be no assurance that the raw materials and components necessary to meet demand will be available in sufficient quantities or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we  or labcorp  should encounter delays or difficulties in securing the necessary raw materials and components for pregen plus  we may need to reconfigure the pregen plus test which would result in delays in commercialization or an interruption in sales and would materially adversely impact our revenues 
the failure of labcorp or any other laboratory using pregen plus to comply with regulations governing clinical laboratories would materially adversely affect our business 
labcorp and any other laboratory that uses pregen plus is subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of  or clia 
clia is a federal law which regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis  prevention or treatment of disease 
clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the us by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications  administration  participation in proficiency testing  patient test management  quality control  quality assurance and inspections 
if labcorp were to lose its clia certification  it may no longer be able to offer pregen plus  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
our success depends largely on the skills  experience and performance of key members of our senior management team  including don m 
hardison  our president and chief executive officer and anthony p 
shuber  our executive vice president and chief technology officer 
anthony p 
shuber has been critical to the development of our technologies and business 
although messrs 
hardison and shuber have each signed a non disclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreement and a non compete agreement  they have no employment agreements currently in place 
we also have a severance agreement with each of messrs 
hardison and shuber that provides for twelve months severance under certain circumstances 
the efforts of each of these persons will be critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies and testing processes 
if we were to lose one or more of these key employees  we may experience difficulties in competing effectively  developing our technologies and implementing our business strategies 
if we lose the support of our key scientific collaborators  it may be difficult to establish tests using our technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening  which may limit our revenue growth and profitability 
we have established relationships with leading scientists  including members of our scientific advisory board  and research and academic institutions  such as mayo clinic and john hopkins university  that we believe are key to establishing tests using our technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening 
if our collaborators determine that colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies are not appropriate options for colorectal cancer screening  or superior to available colorectal cancer screening tests  or that alternative technologies would be more effective in the early detection of colorectal cancer  we would encounter significant difficulty establishing tests using our technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening  which would limit our revenue growth and profitability 
our inability to apply our proprietary technologies successfully to detect other common cancers may limit our revenue growth and profitability 
while  to date  we have focused substantially all of our research and development efforts on colorectal cancer  we have used our technologies to detect cancers of the lung  pancreas  esophagus  stomach and gall bladder 
in the future  we intend to evaluate and potentially extend our technology platform to the development of screening tests for these or other common cancers 
to do so  we may need to overcome technological challenges to develop reliable screening tests for these cancers 
there can be no assurance that our technologies will be capable of reliably detecting cancers  beyond colorectal cancer  with the sensitivity and specificity necessary to be clinically and commercially useful for such other cancers  or that we can develop such technologies at all 
we may never realize any commercial benefit from our research and development activities 
changes in healthcare policy could subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of the pregen plus test and increase our costs 
healthcare policy has been a subject of extensive discussion in the executive and legislative branches of the federal and many state governments 
we and labcorp developed our commercialization strategy for pregen plus based on existing healthcare policies 
changes in healthcare policy could substantially interrupt the sales of pregen plus  increase costs  and divert management s attention 
we cannot predict what changes  if any  will be proposed or adopted or the effect that such proposals or adoption may have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future may limit our growth 
if our capital resources become insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operations 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may have to restrict our operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms 
further  to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
product liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages and increases in our insurance rates 
the sale and use of our test  or activities related to our research and clinical studies  could lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect which resulted in the failure to detect the disease for which it was designed 
a product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend  either of which could materially harm our business or financial condition 
we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance would protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future 
certain provisions of our charter  by laws and delaware law may make it difficult for you to change our management and may also make a takeover difficult 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to change our management and may also enable our management to resist a takeover 
these provisions include a staggered board of directors  limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders and advance notice procedures required for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and cause us to take other corporate actions 
in addition  the existence of these provisions  together with delaware law  might hinder or delay an attempted takeover other than through negotiations with our board of directors 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely 
consequently  the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market under the symbol exas 
factors affecting our stock price may include technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors  clinical trial results relating to the pregen plus tests or those of our competitors  inclusion of stool dna screening in colorectal cancer screening guidelines  stool dna screening becoming a standard of care among prescribing physicians  reimbursement decisions by medicare and other third party payors  fda regulation of our products and services  the establishment of collaborative partnerships  health care legislation  intellectual property disputes and other litigation  additions or departures of key personnel  the performance characteristics of our technologies  general market conditions  the rate of market acceptance of pregen plus and sales of our common stock or debt securities 
because we are a company with no significant operating revenue  you may consider any one of these factors to be material 
our operating results may fluctuate  which may adversely affect our share price 
fluctuations in our operating results may lead to fluctuations  including declines  in our share price 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors  including demand by physicians and consumers for pregen plus  new technology introductions  reimbursement acceptance success  changes in our agreement with labcorp  the number and timing of milestones that we achieve under collaborative agreements  impairment of our intellectual property  the level of our development activity conducted for  and our success in commercializing these developments and the level of our spending on pregen plus commercialization efforts  licensing and acquisition initiatives  clinical studies  and internal research and development 
variations in the timing of our future revenue and expenses could also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated earning shortfalls or losses 
in addition  the nasdaq national market in general  and the market for biotechnology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies
