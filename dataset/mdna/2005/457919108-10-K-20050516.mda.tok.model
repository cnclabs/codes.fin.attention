as a result  the information presented above is not comparative from year to year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the trust is engaged in the ownership and operation of hotel properties 
at january   the innsuites system included six moderate and full service hotels with hotel suites 
certain of our hotels are branded through franchise agreements  which include four best western hotels and one holiday inn hotel 
subsequent to january   the trust ended its franchise agreement with holiday inn and entered into a franchise agreement with best western international for the trust s ontario  california property 
all six hotels are trademarked as innsuites hotels 
we are also involved in various operations incidental to the operation of hotels  such as the operation of restaurants and meeting banquet room rentals 
our operations consist of one reportable segment  hotel ownership  which derives its revenue from the operation of the hotels 
in addition  we receive management fees and trademark license fees 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
we anticipate that the improved economic conditions  combined with the disposition of previously underperforming properties  will create opportunities for the trust in fiscal year better overall economic conditions are expected to result in increased business and leisure travel and support higher room rates  and therefore higher operating margins 
challenges in fiscal year are expected to include continued competition for group business in the markets in which we operate and the trust s ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
we will continue to focus on managing our costs  achieving increased daily rates in the markets where we operate and building occupancy 
we believe that our focus on customer service  adding more two room suites and leveraging technology will enable us to remain competitive 
nbsp  effective february   the trust relinquished its reit status 
as of that date  any distributions to its shareholders are not deductible for purposes of computing the trust s taxable income and the trust will be subject to income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  without offset for distributions of such income to its shareholders 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the trust s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical and involve the most subjective judgments include our estimates and assumptions of future revenue and expenditures used to project property cash flows 
future cash flows are used in the valuation calculation of our hotel properties to determine the recoverability or impairment of the carrying amounts in the event management is required to test the asset for recoverability of its carrying value under statement of financial accounting standards no 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows over its estimated remaining life  the trust recognizes an impairment expense to reduce the asset s carrying value to its fair value 
fair value is determined by either the most current third party property appraisal  if available  or the present value of future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
our evaluation of future cash flows is based on our historical experience and other factors  including certain economic conditions and committed future bookings 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below 
at january   the trust owned a interest in five of the hotels through its sole general partner s interest in the partnership and owned a interest in one hotel 
the trust purchased   and  partnership units during the years ended january   and  respectively 
prior to may   the partnership leased its hotel properties to innsuites hotels 
the corresponding rent expense for innsuites hotels and rent revenue for the partnership  as well as the resulting rent receivable and payable  eliminate in consolidation 
on may   the percentage lease agreements between the partnership and innsuites hotels were terminated 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the partnership agreed to waive innsuites hotels accrued but unpaid rent in exchange for innsuites hotels extending its lease agreements one year 
the total amount waived was  this transaction had a net effect of increasing the trust s stockholders equity by  the expenses of the trust consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees  depreciation of the hotels  management and trademark fees to affiliates and hotel operating expenses 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse the trust for all such expenses 
accordingly  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the hotels 
adr increased by to in fiscal year from in fiscal year occupancy increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily as a result of the disposition of lower occupancy properties 
these dispositions also resulted in an increase in revpar of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions

the trust s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to its shareholders  is its share of the partnership s cash flow and  as of january   its direct ownership of the yuma  arizona property 
the partnership s principal source of revenue after may  is hotel operations for the five properties it owns 
the trust s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to its shareholders  will depend upon the ability of itself and the partnership to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
historically  as a reit  the trust was required to distribute to its shareholders at least of its taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
the termination of the trust s status as a reit  effective february   eliminated this requirement 
however  by relinquishing its status as a reit  the trust will become subject to the payment of income taxes

management believes that cash on hand  future cash receipts from operations  proceeds from hotel sales and borrowings from affiliates in fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the trust s obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
the trust may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by the trust may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as the trust considers prudent 
the trust will acquire or develop additional hotels only as suitable opportunities arise  and the trust will not undertake acquisition or redevelopment of properties unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from borrowings or from the proceeds of additional issuances of shares of beneficial interest or other securities 
however  there can be no assurance that the trust will successfully acquire or develop additional hotels or that proceeds from borrowings or issuances of shares of beneficial interest will be available or in amounts and on terms sufficient to allow such transactions

in cases where the trust does not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for sale  it will reduce the carrying value to the sales price less costs to sell 
the trust did not recognize impairment expense in fiscal year for the twelve months ended january  and  the trust recorded impairment losses of  and  respectively

is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements or results of operations 
in february  the trust adopted fin r  which amended fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin r requires an existing unconsolidated variable interest entity to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risk among all parties involved or if other parties do not have significant capital to finance activities without subordinated financial support from the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity 
as of february   the trust recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from its recognition of the  net stockholder s deficit of the management company  which was the trust s variable interest entity under fin r 
the  charge represented the net effect of the trust reporting  in net assets consisting primarily of receivables and  in net liabilities consisting primarily of debt upon consolidating the financial results of the management company 
all revenue and expense items for the management company and licensing corp 
relating to services provided to the hotels were eliminated when their financial results were consolidated with the trust s results 
revenues and expenses relating to services provided by the management company and licensing corp 
to hotels not owned by the trust  however  were not eliminated 
payroll reimbursements shown in the current period represent amounts received from hotels not owned by the trust 
the effect of consolidating the financial results of the management company and licensing corp 
was accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as a result of consolidating the financial results of the management company with its results  as of february   the trust s financial results include a  charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on the statements of operations resulting in a reduction in its stockholders equity which represents the aggregate stockholders deficit reported by the management company as of february  after june   consolidation of the financial results of the management company and licensing corp 
is no longer required by fin r since innsuites hotels acquired the management contracts and licensing agreements from the management company on that date 
see note to the trust s consolidated financial statements purchase of management and licensing contracts 
inflation the trust s revenue is based on the underlying hotel revenue 
therefore  the trust relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and innsuites hotels ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general  and innsuites hotels in particular  can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit innsuites hotels ability to raise rates faster than inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its mortgage notes payable  notes payable to banks  other notes payable and notes and advances payable to related parties 
the proceeds from these loans were used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand the trust s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the trust s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the trust borrows using fixed rate debt  when possible 
the trust could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
to date  the trust has not entered into any such derivative transactions 
the trust s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair value and other terms required  by year of expected maturity  in order to evaluate the expected cash flow and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
fiscal debt type thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt interest rate available on january  the fair value of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt were determined based on current rates offered for fixed rate debt and variable rate libor debt with similar risks and maturities 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of january  and does not consider those exposures or positions  which would arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the trust s interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during any particular period and future interest rates
