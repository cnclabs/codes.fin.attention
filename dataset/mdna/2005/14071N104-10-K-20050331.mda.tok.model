we distribute our products primarily through independent distributors and value added resellers 
our products run on off the shelf server hardware and on microsoft certified software platforms including microsoft windows nt  windows  windows and windows xp 
we utilize the microsoft 
net development tools widely in our suite of products and interface with a wide variety of hardware equipment and enterprise software products 
captaris was incorporated in the state of washington in our principal executive offices are located in bellevue  washington 
we sell our products primarily through an indirect channel of resellers and distributors  strategic partnerships  original equipment manufacturers oems and private label agreements  as well as through our team of global national account managers that hold dedicated business relationships with assigned accounts on the fortune list 
we believe the use of multiple distribution channels that access many of the same potential customers increases the likelihood that our products will be sold to a particular customer 
other than cisco systems  inc cisco in  when we accelerated the conclusion of our oem agreement with cisco and recognized million in revenue  as discussed below  no single customer represented more than of our net revenue for the years ended december   and oem partners market and sell our products and services in conjunction with their own core products and service portfolios  adding more value to their customers with an integrated go to market approach 
in some cases  these oem agreements provide minimum revenue commitments 
our order fulfillment operations consist primarily of compact disc duplication  documentation fulfillment and distribution of fax boards 
we contract with outside vendors to provide full systems integration and assembly in certain product distribution situations 
our products incorporate a number of commercially available application cards and fax cards that enable integration with certain fax servers 
we currently purchase fax boards from brooktrout  inc  eicon networks corporation and the dialogic division of intel  inc we depend upon these third party manufacturers for fax boards 
if these manufacturers terminate their relationships with us or are unable to fill orders on a timely basis  or experience quality performance issues  we may be unable to meet customer demands  which could delay or decrease our revenue or otherwise have an adverse impact on our operations 
our rightfax and alchemy product lines include third parties software for which we pay royalties 
the software from other companies provides generic or non strategic functionality 
our total royalty expense was less than of revenue in  of revenue in and less than of revenue in we have extensive service offerings that are sold in conjunction with our products  including maintenance  support  professional services and solutions 
all of these offerings are designed to help customers protect and extend their software investment 

table of contents we work with approximately  resellers and distributors located throughout the world 
these resellers and distributors sell and install our products and they receive discounts based on the volume of sales 
within our sales and marketing groups  we dedicate significant resources to monitoring our resellers and distributors and to generating demand and providing market positioning and support for our resellers and distributors 
utilizing the indirect channel approach provides several advantages  including minimizing the investment in office facilities and personnel in field locations and applying greater resources to sales and implementation efforts 
however  with a channel sales model  it is more difficult to track the number and locations of all end users utilizing our products 
this is limiting our ability to capture intelligence around product usage  system integration character  and deployment satisfaction directly from the customer s perspective in order to enhance or build new products  solutions and services 
professional services include implementation consulting  training and other service support 
the vast majority of product implementation is performed by our channel partners 
in some instances  customers request high level installation and consulting services directly from us 
we continually seek opportunities to expand our professional services as we grow our business 
in january  we made the decision to incorporate the mobility technology associated with our infinite product line directly into our business information delivery products 
accordingly  in january  we made an end of life announcement of our standalone infinite mobile delivery product line 
as a result we deemed that the intangible asset related to the infinite technology trade name was impaired and an impairment charge of approximately  was recorded in december acquisitions and divestitures in early  we recognized that our resources were stretched across a breadth of product lines and markets  and in mid  we resolved to narrow our focus to enterprise business information delivery solutions 
as a result  we have completed a number of divestitures and acquisitions which we believe will bring our product lines and markets in line with our growth objectives 
on october   we acquired information management research  inc imr  an englewood  colorado company 
imr s alchemy product line  which helps organization capture  archive and retrieve business information will enable us to provide complete solutions for business information delivery solutions to our worldwide enterprise customers 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we acquired imr for a total of million 
we paid million in cash  including transaction costs of approximately million and assumed liabilities of million  net of cash acquired of  the assumed liabilities include million of deferred tax liabilities related to purchased intangibles not deductible for tax purposes  deferred revenue of million and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million 
the acquisition of imr has been accounted for as a purchase 
on the acquisition date  million of the purchase price was deposited in a third party escrow account for two years as security for certain post closing obligations of the imr shareholders  including indemnification obligations 
in connection with the acquisition we adopted a plan to consolidate all imr finance and administrative functions to our bellevue headquarters 
as such  as part of the purchase price allocation  we recorded a liability of  for severance expenses related to the involuntary termination of fourteen imr employees 
on october   we purchased a distribution business from axient pty limited axient  our former distributor in australia  and established our own distribution subsidiary in australia 
this acquisition provides an operating and service base in one of our key international markets 
the majority of our sales in this market are made through the indirect channel and we expect our resellers and distributors to continue to provide the majority of sales 
we acquired teamplate  inc teamplate on september  to expand our business information delivery product offerings as an extension and complement to our existing rightfax product line and to further penetrate the business process automation market 
we place significant importance on retaining the teamplate senior management team and executed an incentive plan that allows the teamplate management team to earn a minimum of million and up to million over the thirteen quarters following the acquisition  subject to their continued employment and our success in achieving certain performance targets 
our callxpress product line historically had significantly lower margins than our rightfax products and sales of callxpress continued to decline over time  which reflected the depressed market for most telephony products 
in july of  we announced our intent to sell the callxpress voice mail and unified messaging product line 
this announcement prompted some prospective customers to delay buying decisions  which caused a further decline in callxpress sales 
on september   we sold the callxpress product line for million to applied voice and speech technologies  inc avst 
since many activities related to callxpress were shared with the rightfax product line  the callxpress product line results  including the gain 
table of contents on disposition  are included in our results from continuing operations 
at the time of the transaction  we recorded restructuring costs of  primarily associated with terminating employees not retained by avst 
concurrent with the transaction  we entered into an earn out agreement with avst which entitled us to receive additional payments of up to million per year for each of the three years following the sale  depending on avst s success in achieving certain revenue targets 
this gain will be classified on our income statements as a reduction to operating expenses in on march   we received a report from avst  and payment of million  confirming achievement of the revenue target for at the same time as our decision to divest the callxpress product line  we began negotiating an acceleration and conclusion of our oem agreement with cisco 
in october of  we reached an agreement with cisco and accordingly  cisco paid us million as payment in full for all remaining unpaid aggregate license fees  plus an additional hours of support and training services for a period not exceeding months  valued at  as a result of this agreement  million was recorded as license revenue in the fourth quarter of training revenue related to this oem agreement was recognized when the service was rendered in support revenue was recognized ratably from october of through the first nine months of as of december   all the revenue related to the support and training was recognized 
we sold the assets of mediatel corporation mediatel  our wholly owned subsidiary that operated the medialinq business  our outsource e document services division  on september  for million in cash to xpedite systems  inc xpedite  a division of ptek holdings  inc 
ptek 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  mediatel s results of operations  net of income taxes  have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
concurrent with this transaction  we entered into license and reseller agreements with xpedite  under which we license our fax to mail technology to xpedite over a three year period following the sale for a minimum aggregate license fee of million 
in  we recognized  of revenue in connection with these agreements 
in august  we acquired the distribution activities  assets and fifteen employees of officecom bv officecom  our former distributor in the netherlands 
we paid  in cash  assumed net liabilities of  and recorded goodwill of  critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates used  including those related to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  useful lives of intangible assets and equipment and leasehold improvements  inventory valuation allowances  revenue recognition and the estimated allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting policies relate to the following areas revenue recognition  allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts  valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value  classification of investments and assessment of related unrealized losses  valuation of acquired businesses  assets and liabilities  
table of contents impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  impairment of equipment  leasehold improvements and long lived assets  useful lives of intangible assets  equipment and leasehold improvements  and contingencies revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies follow the guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we sell products through resellers  oems and other channel partners  as well as directly to end users 
except for oem sales described below  we recognize product revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
all software licenses are bundled with days of telephone support 
we consider revenue associated with this telephone support to be insignificant  and therefore  we recognize this revenue when the software is shipped and record an estimate for the related cost of the telephone support 
revenue from term software licenses is recognized over the term of the license  generally twelve months 
whenever a software license  hardware  installation and post contract customer support or pcs elements are sold together  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each element based on its respective fair value  which is the price charged when that element is sold separately 
the amount of revenue assigned to each element is impacted by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vsoe for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition for these items 
revenue for pcs is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  ranging from one to five years 
pcs includes rights to unspecified upgrades and updates  when and if available  and bug fixes 
installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer s site and accepted by the customer 
recognition of revenue from software sold with installation services is recognized either when the software is shipped or when the installation services are completed  depending on our agreement with the customer and whether the installation services are integral to the functionality of the software 
revenue from perpetual software licenses is recognized when the software has been shipped  provided that collection for such revenue is deemed probable 
for software sold to resellers in which we have granted exchange rights  we defer the revenue until the reseller sells the software through to end users 
we have entered into agreements with certain oems from which we receive royalty payments periodically 
under the terms of the oem license agreements  each oem will qualify our software on their hardware and software configurations 
once the software has been qualified  the oem will begin to ship products and report net sales to us 
most oems pay a license fee based on the number of copies of licensed software included in the products sold to their customers 
these oems pay fees on a per unit basis and we record associated revenue when we receive notification of the oems sales of the licensed software to an end user 
the terms of the license agreements generally require the oems to notify us of sales of our products within to days after the end of the month or quarter in which the sales occur 
as a result  we recognize the revenue in the month or quarter following the sales of the product to these oems customers 
in general  customers are granted a day right of return for product sales 
we reduce revenue recognized for estimated product returns at the time the related revenue is recorded 
when customer acceptance provisions are present and we cannot reasonably estimate returns  we recognize revenue upon the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
costs related to insignificant customer support obligations  which include telephone support  are recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized 
consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates  plus out of pocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed 
however  if it is determined that a consulting engagement will be unprofitable  we recognize the loss at the time of such determination 
training revenue is recognized when the training is completed 
allowance for sales return 
we estimate potential future product returns related to current period revenue based on our historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
we periodically review the adequacy of our sales returns allowance and underlying assumptions 
if the assumptions we use to calculate the estimated sales returns do not properly reflect future returns  a change in accruals for sales returns would be made in the period in which such a determination was made 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make ongoing assumptions as to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make estimates based on our historical bad debts  the aging of customer accounts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
our reserves historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  if actual credit losses were to fluctuate significantly from the reserves we have established  our general and administrative expenses could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value 
due to rapid changes in technology  it is possible that older products in inventory may become obsolete or that we may sell these products below cost 
when we determine that the carrying value of inventories is not recoverable  we write down inventories to market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  inventory write downs may be required  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
classification of investments and assessment of related unrealized losses 
we classify our short term and long term investments as available for sale 
our investments are comprised of government agency issues  mortgage backed securities  corporate debt securities  municipal securities and certificates of deposit and are recorded at fair market value 
we determine the fair value of our investments based on quoted market prices 
investments with expected maturities of one year or less are classified as short term 
we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method 
we believe that the expected lives of our mortgage backed securities investments are much shorter than the stated maturities due to mortgage refinances and sales of homes 
accordingly  we have estimated the portion of the mortgages likely to be prepaid within one year based on historical prepayment data  current interest rates and other economic factors  and classified a portion of these investments as short term 
unrealized gains and losses  net of any income tax effect  are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
interest income is recorded using an effective interest rate  with the associated premium or discount amortized to interest income over the term of the investment 
we recognize an impairment charge for unrealized losses when an investment s decline in fair value is below the cost basis and is judged to be other than temporary 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial condition and near term business outlook for the investee and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
valuation of acquired businesses  assets and liabilities 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
as of december  and  our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million and million  respectively 
the determination of the fair value of such intangible assets and goodwill is a critical and complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions and estimates are based on our best judgments and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the first quarter of the year  and on an interim basis in certain circumstances 
we conducted our annual assessment during the first quarter of and determined our goodwill at march   was not impaired 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators include our assessment of the impacts of legal factors  market and economic conditions  the results of our operational performance and strategic plans  competition and market share  and any potential for the sale or disposal of a significant portion of our principal operations 
if we conclude that indicators of impairment exist  we then assess the fair value of goodwill 
the valuation process provides an estimate of a fair value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow model and includes many assumptions and estimates 
once the valuation is determined  we will write down goodwill to its determined fair value  if necessary 
any write down could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of equipment  leasehold improvements  long lived assets and other intangible assets 
we periodically review long lived assets  other intangibles and product lines that we are more likely than not to sell or otherwise dispose of before the end of the asset s previously estimated useful life to determine if there is any impairment of these assets 
we assess the impairment of these assets  or the need to accelerate amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our long lived assets and other intangibles 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the assets should be reviewed to determine their fair value 
the valuation process provides an estimate of a fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and includes many assumptions and estimates 
once the valuation is determined  we will write down these assets to their determined fair value  if necessary 
any write down could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for information regarding intangible asset impairment  see discussion under impairment of intangible assets below 

table of contents useful lives of equipment  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
equipment and leasehold improvements  identifiable intangible assets and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives for equipment and leasehold improvements are based on our estimates of the period that the equipment or leasehold improvement will be used 
useful lives for intangible assets are based on our estimates of the period that the intangible assets will generate cash 
changes in estimated useful lives could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
contingencies 
we are periodically involved in litigation or claims  including patent infringement claims  in the normal course of our business 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to record litigation or claim related expenses 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
we accrue for settlements when the outcome is probable and the amount or range of the settlement can be reasonably estimated 
in addition to our judgments and use of estimates  there are inherent uncertainties surrounding litigation and claims that could result in actual settlement amounts that differ materially from estimates 
we expense our legal costs associated with these matters when incurred 
in addition  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
to record potential income tax claims 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish accruals for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these accruals are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of potential tax claims and changes to accruals that we consider appropriate  as well as the related interest expense 
in addition to our judgments and use of estimates  there are inherent uncertainties surrounding income taxes that could result in actual amounts that differ materially from our estimates 
any adjustments in our tax provision related to these contingencies could have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow

table of contents net revenue we derive net revenue primarily from licensing software as well as follow on sales of add on software modules and the sale of maintenance and support agreements 
we continue to distribute fax boards with a significant number of our software product sales for which we receive a margin significantly less than the margin on our software products 
percent change from percent change from in thousands net revenue rightfax product line workflow product line alchemy product line cisco oem agreement callxpress product line net revenue years ended december  and the decrease in net revenue in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the fact that fiscal included million of revenue from the acceleration of an oem agreement with cisco and million of revenue from our callxpress product line which we divested in september excluding the effect of this oem agreement and callxpress revenue in  net revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in revenue from the rightfax product line  an increase of million from the workflow product line formally teamplate and million from the alchemy product line  which we acquired on october  the increase in rightfax revenue was primarily due to an increase in the volume of maintenance and support contracts sold as a result of our decision in february to begin requiring first year maintenance with our software licenses 
this significantly increased revenue derived from maintenance agreements compared to prior periods 
revenue for maintenance agreements is recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance contract term  ranging from one to five years 
in addition  the increase in revenue from the rightfax product line was also attributable to an increase in the volume of software licenses and hardware sold 
the increase in workflow revenue was due to only three months of sales in compared to a full twelve months of sales in sales of the workflow product began in september with the acquisition of teamplate 
international net revenue represented approximately   and of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
international revenue from the rightfax product line represented of total net revenue for compared to for the increase in revenue from our international regions is due to our continued investment and expansion into international markets 
in october  we acquired a distribution business from axient pty limited in australia 
revenue in reflected a full twelve months from our operations in australia  compared to revenue in which included only two months of operations in australia 
we expect the portion of our revenue derived from international markets to increase in because a significant portion of alchemy sales are made internationally 
we anticipate that consolidated net revenue will grow approximately to in due to an increase in the volume of software licenses sold as well as experiencing a full twelve months in of revenue from the alchemy product line 
we anticipate that net revenue for compared to from the rightfax product line will be reasonably consistent with the prior year growth rate 
historically  our business experiences seasonality with a decline in revenue during the first quarter as compared to the prior year s fourth quarter  building gradually during the second and third quarters  and ending with our largest quarter for revenue being our fourth quarter 
we anticipate this pattern to continue in years ended december  and the million increase in net revenue in compared to is primarily attributable to additional revenue from the acceleration of an oem agreement with cisco  increased revenue from the rightfax product line and revenue from the workflow product line  which we acquired on september  the increase in revenue was partially offset by the divestiture of the callxpress product line on september  the decline in the callxpress revenue for the first nine months of compared to was primarily due to a prolonged depressed market for most telephony products and the announcement in july of our intent to sell the callxpress product line 
excluding revenue from the callxpress product line and from the cisco oem agreement  net revenue for increased or million from this increase was primarily attributable to increased demand for our rightfax products 
revenue growth from the rightfax product line was much stronger in the second half of which we believe reflected the benefit of narrowing our sales and marketing focus to business information delivery 
in october  we reached an agreement with cisco to accelerate the conclusion of our oem agreement announced in january pursuant to the agreement  cisco paid us million as payment in full for all remaining unpaid aggregate license fees  plus an additional hours of support and training services for a 
table of contents period not exceeding twelve months  valued at  as a result of this agreement  license fees related to the cisco oem agreement were million in  compared to million in training revenue related to this oem agreement is recognized when service has been rendered 
support revenue is recognized ratably from october through the first nine months of international revenue from the rightfax product line represented of total net revenue for compared to for the increase in revenue from our international regions is due to our continued investment and expansion into international markets 
in august  we acquired our long time distributor in the netherlands and in october  we acquired a distribution business from axient pty limited in australia 
revenue in reflected a full twelve months from our operations in the netherlands and two months from our operations in australia  compared to revenue in which included only five months of operations in the netherlands 
workflow  our business process automation product line  contributed net revenue of  during the fourth quarter of gross profit gross profit is calculated as the selling price of our products  net of estimated returns  less cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold  royalties for licensed products  amortization of acquired technology  product warranty costs  operation costs related to product support and costs associated with the delivery of professional services 
percent change from percent change from in thousands gross profit percentage of revenue years ended december  and the decrease in gross profit for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the fact that fiscal revenue included million from the acceleration of an oem agreement with cisco and cost of revenue related to this agreement was insignificant 
excluding the impact of gross profit from the cisco agreement  gross profit as a percent of revenue was for gross profit increased as a percentage of revenue in compared to  excluding the cisco agreement  due to the change from sales of the lower margin callxpress product line  which we divested in september  to sales of the rightfax product line and sales of maintenance and support contracts 
the increase in gross profit percentage was partially offset by amortization of technology intangibles included in cost of revenue related to the workflow product line acquired in september and the alchemy product line acquired on october  in addition  the increase in gross profit percentage was also partially offset by an increase in the portion of revenue attributable to hardware products which are sold at significantly lower gross profit margins than software products 
we anticipate gross profit as a percentage of revenue for will increase slightly from due to increased revenue from the workflow and alchemy product lines which carry a higher gross margin than the rightfax product line 
the rightfax product line has a lower gross margin than the workflow and alchemy products lines because it is bundled with our lower margin hardware products 
years ended december  and the increase in gross profit for compared to is primarily attributable to an million increase in revenue from the oem agreement with cisco in compared to  as noted above 
realization of revenue from the cisco oem agreement had a material impact on our gross profit  as cost of revenue related to this agreement is insignificant 
in addition to the contribution from the oem agreement with cisco  exiting the lower margin callxpress product line in september and higher rightfax sales volume also contributed to the increase in gross profit 
excluding gross profit from the cisco oem agreement  gross profit increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit was in  compared to in due to a higher sales volume from the rightfax product line in conjunction with less sales volume from the lower margin callxpress product line 
this increase in gross profit percentage was offset by amortization of technology intangibles related to the workflow product line included in cost of revenue and an increase in the percent of revenue attributable to hardware products which are sold at significantly lower gross profit margins than software products

percent change from percent change from in thousands research and development percentage of revenue years ended december  and for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased compared to the year ended december   primarily due to additional spending on engineering and testing costs relating to the release of two new versions of the rightfax product line in february and november and the release of a new version of workflow in late additionally  in we incurred twelve months of workflow research and development expenses compared to three months of these expenses in as a result of the acquisition of teamplate in late september we also incurred only two months of research and development expenses in related to the alchemy product line which we acquired in our acquisition of imr in late october the increase in research and development expenses in was partially offset by the divestiture of the callxpress product line in september we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as well as a percentage of revenue during as we invest further in new version releases of our rightfax and workflow product lines and further develop and integrate the newly acquired alchemy product line 
in addition  will reflect a full twelve months of research and development expenses related to the alchemy product line compared to only two months of the expenses in the workflow product line is relatively young and we anticipate more frequent and substantive product releases than with our more mature rightfax and alchemy product lines 
years ended december  and the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to is due to a decrease in staffing costs as a result of having fewer employees in compared to in addition  the research and development expenses for included a reversal of a performance incentive arrangement of approximately  selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and related expenses for sales  marketing  business development  customer service  finance  administrative and information technology personnel  as well as advertising and marketing expenses 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses include legal  accounting and other professional fees 
percent change from percent change from in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of revenue years ended december  and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to the following costs incurred in related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as  increased accountant fees relating to the audit of our financial statements and the restatement of footnote disclosures in our quarterly financial statements for  legal expenses incurred in related to a potential acquisition that we abandoned  a full year of selling and marketing expenses related to our workflow product line that we acquired in september  increased state sales and excise taxes  and increased selling commissions due to the increase in revenue from the rightfax and workflow product lines 
in addition  a portion of the increase in is attributable to the addition of selling  general and administrative expenses for imr which we acquired in late october offsetting the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was a decrease in bad debt expenses compared to the callxpress product line  which we divested in september  experienced a higher rate of bad debts then the rightfax product line 
during  incremental compliance spending included several additions to our finance and legal departments and significant expenses for temporary labor and professional fees associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of total external costs  third party consultants and outside audit services for our sarbanes oxley project in were million 

table of contents we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in to increase resulting from twelve months of selling  general and administrative expenses related to imr in as compared to two months in in  we expect to incur expenses similar to associated with our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
years ended december  and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to lower staffing costs resulting from a reduction in our workforce during and  offset by severance expenses in and further offset by additional incentive compensation awards related to the increase in revenue in compared to approximately  of severance expense was incurred in in connection with the termination of several former management level employees 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets is a result of the acquisitions of imr  teamplate and infinite technologies  in addition to amortization expense associated with two nonexclusive license agreements with syntellect and audiofax

based on the current amount of intangible assets subject to amortization  we estimate amortization expense for the next five years will be as follows million for  million in  million in  million in  million in and  in see additional discussion of amortization expense in patent settlement with audiofax  discussed below 
impairment of intangible assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
prescribes one accounting model for long lived assets and requires these assets to be measured at the lower of book value or fair value 
in connection with our decision to incorporate the mobility technology associated with our infinite product line directly into our business information delivery products  effective january  we deemed that the intangible asset related to the infinite technology trade name was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  we engaged a valuation firm to provide an estimated fair value of each of our intangible long lived assets using a discounted cash flow model 
the determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions and estimates were based on our best judgments 
as a result  we determined that certain intangible assets acquired from infinite technologies in january were impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the mobile delivery reporting unit in the second quarter of this impairment charge consisted of a write down of core technology of approximately million  a write down of customer base and marketing channel of approximately million and a write down of trade name of approximately  in  we merged the mobile delivery reporting unit with our fax and messaging reporting unit 
restructuring charges in september  in conjunction with the sale of our callxpress product line  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  for severance and related benefits for terminated employees 
all costs associated with this restructuring were paid as of december  in january  we announced a reduction of our workforce  affecting approximately employees  or of our total workforce 
this reduction in force resulted in the recognition of a restructuring charge recorded in continuing operations of million related to severance  impairment of certain assets and non cancelable lease obligations and a restructuring charge recorded in discontinued operations of  related to severance 
all costs associated with this reduction in force were paid as of december stock based compensation expense benefit during the second quarter of  we offered a limited non compulsory exchange of employee stock options on a less than one for one basis 
the exchange which closed on july  resulted in the voluntary cancellation of employee stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock with varying exercise prices greater than per share in exchange for  employee stock options with an exercise price of 
the option exchange offer resulted in variable accounting treatment for a total of  options  representing the  new options granted in the exchange as well as all employee options modified during the year 
variable accounting treatment results in charges or credits recorded to stock based compensation  depending on fluctuations in quoted prices for our common stock and the number of stock options subject to 
table of contents variable accounting  neither of which can be predicted 
at december   and  the number of options to purchase common stock subject to variable accounting  were   and  respectively 
in  we recognized a benefit for variable stock compensation of  in  we recorded a charge for variable stock compensation of million consisting of a charge recorded in continuing operations of million and a charge recorded in discontinued operations of  in  we recorded a benefit for variable stock based compensation expense of million  consisting of a benefit recorded in continuing operations of  and a benefit recorded in discontinued operations of  we expect to record stock compensation charges or benefits in the first two quarters of for the options outstanding subject to variable accounting 
the amount of these charges or benefits will depend on our stock price and the number of stock options subject to variable accounting that are outstanding during each quarter  neither of which can be predicted 
these charges or benefits could have a material impact on our reported financial results in a particular quarter or for the year 
when we adopt sfas no 
r in the third quarter of  stock compensation charges or benefits will be calculated in accordance with the new standard and charges or benefits related to options subject to variable accounting will cease 
we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of this new statement and as such  estimates of the effect of this statement cannot be reasonably determined at this time  however  we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

gain on sale of the callxpress product line in september of  we sold our callxpress product line 
we recognized a gain on the sale of callxpress of approximately million before income taxes in the year ended december  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
patent settlement with audiofax in april of  we entered into a nonexclusive license agreement with audiofax ip llc  settling a patent infringement suit filed by audiofax on november  we paid a one time fee to license the technology until the patents expire in and in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of  reflecting our assessment of the fair value of the portion of the license fee that related to prior years 
the balance of the license fee has been capitalized and is amortized over the remaining life of the licensor s patents 
amortization expense related to this license was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and was recorded in cost of revenue 
other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of investment income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
for the years ended december   and  other income was  million and million  respectively 
the decline in other income is primarily a result of a decrease in interest income due to a decrease in our invested cash balances 
our invested cash balances have significantly decreased due to cash used to acquire imr in october  the acquisition of teamplate in september and cash used to repurchase of our common stock in and  partially offset by cash received from the sale in of our mediatel assets and callxpress product line  as well as from exercises of stock options in and assuming interest rates remain at recent levels  we expect interest income to further decline in due to the reduction in our investment balances late in with the acquisition of imr 
income tax expense benefit we are subject to income taxes in both the united states of america and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish accruals for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these accruals are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of potential tax claims and changes to accruals that we consider appropriate  as well as the related penalties and interest 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to acquisition related costs  research and development tax credits  state taxes  the tax impact of foreign operations  tax exempt interest income and accruals for certain tax exposures discussed above 
the effective income tax rates on income and losses from continuing operations in  and were  and  respectively 
in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million which included the reversal of tax accruals of approximately million primarily associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitations on tax years prior to excluding the impact of this benefit  our effective tax rate for was approximately 
we recognized

see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations in september of  we completed the sale of the assets of mediatel 
as such  mediatel s results of operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations for the years  and during  we recorded a net gain of  which included additional proceeds of  net of income taxes  a federal income tax refund of  including associated interest income less professional fees  both net of income taxes  and legal fees incurred in defense of various legal proceedings of  net of expected insurance reimbursements  both net of income taxes 
in  we recognized a gain of approximately million  net of income taxes of million 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in january  in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 we engaged a valuation firm to assist us in assessing the fair value of goodwill recorded on our books as of january  the valuation process provided a fair value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow model that also considered factors such as market capitalization and estimated values of certain assets 
the determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration when assessing impairment under sfas no 
that involves significant assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions and estimates were based on our best judgments  and we recorded a transitional impairment charge in the first quarter of for a portion of the goodwill in our mobile business solutions reporting unit 
this transitional impairment charge was approximately million  and the effect of adopting sfas no 
is reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments available for sale and long term investments available for sale 
our portfolio consists primarily of money market funds  adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  municipal and us government agency backed securities 
at december   cash and cash equivalents and investment balances totaled million  down million from december  the cash and investments decrease in was due primarily to the purchase of imr for million  the repurchase of our common stock for million  the redemption of common stock issued in connection with the purchase of teamplate for million and capital purchases of million 
this decrease in cash was partially offset by net cash flow provided by operations of million  proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of mediatel assets of  net of legal fees of  and income taxes  and an income tax refund of  related to the mediatel business 
cash flow provided by operations during was million compared to million provided during in  cash flow from operations included a million cash receipt from cisco due to the acceleration of an oem agreement 
excluding the cisco transaction in  cash flow from operations in increased million over this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred revenue  a decrease in inventory and a decrease of prepaid expenses  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and the payment of income taxes 
the increase in deferred revenue was primarily attributable to increased sales of maintenance contracts in cash used in investing activities during was million  consisting primarily of the purchase of imr  purchases of marketable investments and capital equipment  partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable investments 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million and consisted of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable investments and proceeds from the sales of our mediatel assets and callxpress product line  partially offset by purchases of marketable investments  the acquisition of teamplate and certain capital equipment 
cash used in financing activities during was million 
we used million to repurchase million shares of our common stock and we used million to redeem  shares of our common stock issued in the acquisition of teamplate 
in  we received million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
cash provided by financing activities during was million and consisted primarily of million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by the repurchase of million of our common stock 
we believe existing cash and short term investments together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital needs and capital expenditure needs for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 

table of contents stock repurchase plan pursuant to a stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors  we repurchased million  million and million of our common stock in  and  respectively 
in january  our board of directors approved an million increase to our previously announced stock repurchase program 
including the increase  approximately million remains available to repurchase shares 
we may repurchase shares in the future subject to open trading windows  overall market conditions  stock prices and our cash position and requirements going forward 
the repurchase program will continue until the earlier of a such time when the maximum dollar amount authorized has been utilized or b our board of directors elects to discontinue the repurchase program 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have operating leases for all of our offices and certain equipment 
rental expense for operating leases was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases over the lease term 
minimum rental expenses are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and estimated commercial commitments as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity in future periods payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases  net of sublease income purchase obligations teamplate incentive program long term commitments purchase commitments total contractual obligations and estimated commercial commitments notes as part of the effort to retain the management team of teamplate  we offered an incentive plan that allows the teamplate management team to earn a minimum of million up to a maximum of million over the thirteen quarter period following the closing  subject to their continued employment and our success in achieving certain performance targets 
long term commitments represent a commitment made to purchase software maintenance and support 
purchase commitments include minimum commitments to purchase telecommunication services 
we have a million cash secured revolving line of credit which is reserved for letters of credit 
as of december   we have used the letter of credit capacity in conjunction with our corporate headquarters lease 
we have placed million in a restricted certificate of deposit with the bank that supports the letter of credit 
prior to august  we had a million unsecured revolving line of credit  of which million was for unsecured borrowings and million was reserved for letters of credit 
we did not borrow under our line of credit during the year ended december  the line of credit expired in august  and we renewed million of the line to be used to secure the corporate headquarters lease as discussed above 
material indemnification obligations pursuant to the terms of the sale of our mediatel assets to ptek and the sale of our callxpress product line to avst in september  we have agreed to indemnify these two parties against various representations and warranties we made in connection with these transactions 
at december   no claims for indemnification were outstanding from ptek or avst  however  there can be no assurance that indemnification claims will not be made in the future 
any such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 

table of contents material intellectual property contingencies we periodically receive letters and other communications from third parties asserting patent rights and requesting royalty payments and will probably receive additional claims in the future 
over the past six years  we have been involved in intermittent communications with avaya  which was spun off from lucent technologies in over this period of time  lucent avaya asserted that we were infringing on their patents or technology  eventually identifying patents as including claims that allegedly cover our current or former products and or services 
several communications and meetings between us and lucent avaya have occurred 
we have also been in communication with bellsouth since december of  at which time bellsouth asserted that we were infringing on two of its patents 
analysis of both patents in light of our current and former products services is still underway 
the last communication with representatives of bellsouth was on june  the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined 
as such  we have not recorded an accrual for these exposures 
the ultimate resolution of these matters  however  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
material legal contingencies as discussed in detail under item legal proceedings in this annual report on form k  we have been named as third party defendants in three lawsuits alleging violations of the telephone consumer protection act in connection with the receipt by the plaintiffs of facsimile advertisements that were transmitted by mediatel corporation  our wholly owned subsidiary  before its business was sold in september the complaints seek injunctive relief and unspecified damages and two of the lawsuits seek certification as a class action on behalf of the plaintiff and others similarly situated throughout the united states that received the facsimile advertisements 
under the telephone consumer protection act  a court can impose liability of per fax on a party that sends a fax without the consent of the recipient and can increase the liability to  per fax if the sending of the fax is willful 
we are vigorously defending these cases  but litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of any of these matters 
moreover  the amount of any potential liability in connection with these cases will depend  to a large extent  on whether a class is certified  and if one is certified  on what the scope of that class will be  neither of which can be predicted at this time 
we have tendered these claims to our general liability insurance carrier and coverage has been disputed 
even if coverage is determined to apply  since the potential liability of these claims is substantially in excess of our coverage limits  there can be no assurance that our coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any damages we are required to pay 
we have not recorded a liability related to these cases 
however  there is no guarantee that we will not determine in the future that an accrual is required or that we will not be required to pay damages in respect of these cases in the future  either of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition for the quarter or year in which any accrual is recorded or any damages are paid 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payments  that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and other forms of share based compensation 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb no 
 and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
under sfas no 
r  share based compensation arrangements  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans  will result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
this cost  including the related income tax effects  will be recognized as the shares vest 
compensation cost for awards that vest would not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
the fair value of the awards can be determined using an option pricing model that appropriately reflects our specific circumstances and the economics of our transactions 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies for periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of this new statement 
as such  at this time  we have not estimated the effect of this statement on our results of operations 
however  we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas no 
b  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act ajca of the ajca introduces a limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fsp fas no 
b provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
we do not anticipate repatriating earnings from our foreign entities in the foreseeable future and therefore no provision for the tax effect of such repatriation has been made 

table of contents also included in the ajca is a provision for a tax deduction on qualified production activities 
we believe that we may benefit from this provision but since this special deduction does not come into effect until  we do not have the necessary information to estimate the amount of this deduction at this time 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf no 
establishes additional disclosure requirements for each category of sfas no 
investments in a loss position and provides guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
effective for years ending after december   companies must disclose the aggregate amount of unrealized losses and the aggregate related fair value of their investments with unrealized losses 
those investments are required to be segregated by those in a loss position for less than twelve months and those in a loss position for greater than months 
additionally  certain qualitative disclosures are required to clarify a circumstance whereby an investment s fair value that is below cost is not considered other than temporary 
in september  the fasb delayed the provisions of eitf no 
which provide guidance on evaluating whether an impairment is other than temporary 
the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual financial statements 
although we will continue to evaluate the application of eitf no 
 management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to market risk  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of the our investments 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of investment grade interest bearing securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the interest bearing securities in our portfolio are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels at december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would be approximately  because we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  we do not expect our operating results  financial condition or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency risk currently  substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 
we price our international sales to the united kingdom in british pounds sterling  to canada in canadian dollars  to australia in australian dollars and to participating european community countries in euros 
increases in the value of the dollar against any local currencies could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region  leading to reduced revenue or profitability in that country or region 
as we continue to expand our international operations  we expect our non us dollar denominated revenue and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions to increase 
we do not currently engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of currency fluctuations  but we may do so in the future 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency translation fluctuations associated with our assets and liabilities denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars  euros and british pounds sterling 
the objective in managing these foreign currency translation exposures is to minimize the risk through minimizing the level of activity and financial instruments denominated in those currencies 
our foreign currency financial instruments primarily consist of cash  trade receivables  trade payables  accrued expenses and intercompany loans 
for an entity with various financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net asset position  a strengthening us dollar would result in less net assets when converted to us dollars 
conversely  for an entity with various financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net liability position  a weakening in the us dollar would result in more net liabilities when converted to us dollars 
historically  we have not hedged our translation risks on these currencies 
we have the ability to hold our foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and do not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would have a material impact on future results of operations or cash flow 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the underlying foreign currency exposures described above 
the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a  loss in fair values of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at december
