overview of performance and company and industry trends 
at the beginning of  because of the strong sales market for well leased  high quality assets  the company decided to sell certain assets in its office portfolio in an attempt to capture some of the value it had created 
by early november  the company and its joint ventures had sold approximately billion of office assets  of which the company s share was approximately million 
in november  it paid million in a special dividend of per share  bringing the company s total special dividends for the past two years to per share 
harvesting value at the right time  reinvesting in new development opportunities and returning value to shareholders is a central part of the company s strategy 
the strength of the office sales market in was contrasted with the lackluster office leasing market 
an oversupply of space and slow job growth continued to depress office market fundamentals  leading to higher than normal vacancies  high tenant concessions and roll downs in rental rates 
however  management now anticipates modest  but steady  improvements in the company s key office markets over the next couple of years 
retail and residential demand  on the other hand  have continued to be strong in retail s strength has come largely from the consumer side of the economy  while residential demand has been driven by a favorable interest rate environment and demographic trends 
one of the company s key strategies for many years has been to recycle capital from mature  stable properties  where management believes the company has maximized its value creation  into new projects that offer better opportunities to create value 
this recycling helps avoid the need for additional equity funding for new development  and management believes that over time it should allow the company to generate higher returns to stockholders 
the company has executed this strategy in the past through financings  joint ventures and sales 
this year  due to the strength in the real estate investment sales market  the company decided to sell a number of high quality assets in its office portfolio 
management believes that the company received attractive pricing on its asset sales  despite the current difficulties in the office leasing markets  and even though many of these properties were encumbered by debt with interest rates above today s market levels 
after giving careful thought to future capital needs  the company decided to pay an all cash special dividend to its common stockholders from the asset sales proceeds 
management concluded the company did not need this capital to fund future growth 
in addition  the company recognized that its ability to maximize total returns in the future depends  at least in part  on the size of its equity capital base 
limiting the size of this base  while the company continues to pursue development projects  should allow the value creation from development to have a greater impact on the company s total returns 
the long term strategy of the company is to produce strong stockholder returns 
other factors  such as the size of the company  or even short term consistency of earnings and ffo  are secondary 
since the company often recycles capital from stable assets into development projects  its earnings will vary from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
management believes that the company s ffo will be less in than in because of the smaller asset base following the asset sales and special dividend  and the high level of development projects that are not yet producing income 
but management believes ffo should grow as the company s development projects become operational  and total returns should be higher in the long run  due to the company s smaller equity base 

table of contents because of the capital recycling from the recent asset sales  management believes the company s financial condition is sound 
in addition to the asset sales  the company issued million of perpetual preferred stock in december  bringing the total outstanding preferred stock to million 
management believes that the proceeds of this offering  along with availability under the company s million credit facility  will provide liquidity to support the company s development plans in and in  the company took a number of steps designed to expand its development capacity 
the land division expanded its partnership with temple inland  and is experiencing a strong volume of residential lot sales as well as sales of tracts for residential and related uses 
the company also began an industrial division 
the company also added several key people to the retail division to help execute its development plans 
in addition  the company has made an effort to retain key talent in the office division 
the company made modest investments in the condominium market in with projects in miami and atlanta  both with development partners 
in miami  the company began marketing a project in partnership with the related group of florida 
in atlanta  the company purchased land for a midtown project that will be developed with the gellerstedt group 
as a result of the company s efforts to expand development capacity  the company is pursuing a large number of projects in several sunbelt markets  including atlanta  austin  dallas  albuquerque and san jose 
however  we expect that will be a challenging year 
rising interest rates could dampen residential demand 
the company needs to make decisions about whether to lease vacant office space in today s difficult markets or wait for possible improvement in the near term 
most of all  the company needs to focus attention on executing its development opportunities well while managing its existing properties to its traditional standards 
management believes that demographic trends will support new development opportunities over the next several years  especially in its core markets such as california  texas  georgia and florida 
the company intends to pursue development opportunities wherever it believes it can create quality projects that present good opportunities for value creation 
these will likely include avenue lifestyle centers  retail power centers  residential lot developments  warehouse and distribution facilities and office buildings 
in addition  the company will continue to look for opportunities to create value with land  both by acquiring strategic tracts of land for future development and by creating value in land it intends to sell to others 
the company will also continue to explore ways to pursue urban mixed use projects  given the strong demographic trends that will drive those types of development in many of the company s markets for years to come 
critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
as the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing office  retail and industrial real estate properties and developing single family residential communities which are parceled into lots and sold to various home builders  its critical accounting policies relate to cost capitalization  impairment of long lived assets  depreciation and amortization  residential lot and land tract sales profit recognition and valuation of receivables 
the company expenses predevelopment costs incurred on a potential project until it becomes probable that the project will go forward 
after a project becomes probable  all subsequently incurred predevelopment costs  as well as interest  real estate taxes and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to the project under development  are capitalized 
if the project s probability comes into question  a reserve may be placed on the assets 
if the decision is made to abandon development of a project that had been deemed probable  all previously capitalized costs are expensed or the project is written off against the reserve  if one was established 
therefore  a change in the probability of a project could result in the expensing of significant costs incurred for predevelopment activity 
furthermore  if a project is developed  a change in the estimated time and cost of construction could adversely impact the return on the project and the amount of value created from the development of the project 
the company periodically evaluates its real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and records impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the evaluation of real estate assets involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
for example  future cash flows from properties are estimated using expected market rental rates  anticipated leasing results and potential sales results 
a change in assumptions concerning future economic events could result in an adverse change in the value of a property and cause an impairment to be recorded 
the company has analyzed all real estate assets that had indicators of impairment and has determined that the carrying value 
table of contents of all real estate assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets does not exceed undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets 
based on this analysis  no impairment losses were required to be recorded 
unconsolidated joint ventures follow the same impairment assessment of their properties as the company 
the company evaluates its investments in joint ventures  if indicators warrant the need for a review  utilizing a discounted cash flow calculation 
if the calculation results in a lower amount than the carrying value  the company determines whether the impairment is other than temporary and records an adjustment  if needed 
real estate assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
management uses its judgment when estimating the life of the real estate assets and when allocating the cost of acquired properties 
historical data  comparable properties and replacement costs are some of the factors considered in determining useful lives and cost allocations 
if management incorrectly estimates the useful lives of the company s real estate assets or if cost allocations are not appropriate  then depreciation and amortization may not be reflected properly in the company s operations 
in its determination of the gross profit percentages to be applied to its residential lot or land tract sales in order to calculate the profits to be recognized on these sales  the company utilizes several estimates 
gross profit percentages are calculated based on the estimated lot sales prices and the estimated costs of the development or on the estimated total land tract sales and any estimated development or improvement costs 
the company must estimate the prices of the lots or land tracts to be sold  the costs to complete the development of the residential community or the land improvements and the time period over which the lots or land tracts will ultimately be sold 
if the company s estimated lot or land tract sales or costs of development  or the assumptions underlying either  were to be revised or be rendered inaccurate  it could affect the gross profit percentages and overall profit recognized on these sales 
receivables  including straight line rent receivables  are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and may be uncollectible in the future 
the company performs credit reviews and analyses on its tenants and reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance recorded against its receivables 
this review process requires the company to make certain judgments regarding collectibility notwithstanding the fact that ultimate collections are inherently difficult to predict 
a change in the judgments made could result in an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding effect to net income

funds from operations 
the table below shows funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and the related reconciliation to net income available to common stockholders for cousins properties incorporated and consolidated entities and its unconsolidated joint ventures 
effective january   the company adopted the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo  which is net income available to common stockholders computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding extraordinary items  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo for prior years has been restated to conform to nareit s definition of ffo 
in october  nareit revised its prior ffo implementation guidance to indicate that impairment losses are not an adjustment when calculating ffo 
the company had an impairment loss in which is not treated as an adjustment to net income in the ffo calculation below 
prior to  the company reported ffo based upon nareit s definition with certain modifications  including the elimination of straight line rents and reporting stock appreciation rights on a cash basis 
a schedule reconciling gaap net income with ffo reported by the company and ffo calculated pursuant to nareit s definition for through is available through the supplemental sec information link on the company s web site at www 
cousinsproperties 
com 

table of contents in  the company incurred a  loss on early extinguishment of debt and treated it as an extraordinary item in accordance with gaap 
extraordinary items are excluded when calculating ffo 
as of january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which no longer characterizes such costs as extraordinary and which requires prior periods to be restated 
ffo for has accordingly been restated 
adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on net income available to common stockholders 
ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the company believes the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
company management evaluates the operating performance of its reportable segments and of its divisions based on ffo 
additionally  the company uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to its officers and employees
