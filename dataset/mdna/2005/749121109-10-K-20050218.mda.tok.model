item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements at the end of this item for additional factors relating to such statements as well as for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
business overview and presentation we provide local telecommunications and related services  long distance services and wireless  data and video services within our local service area  which consists of the state region of arizona  colorado  idaho  iowa  minnesota  montana  nebraska  new mexico  north dakota  oregon  south dakota  utah  washington and wyoming 
we also provide interlata long distance services and reliable  scalable and secure broadband data  voice and video communications outside our local service area as well as globally 
we previously provided directory publishing services in our local service area 
in the third quarter  we entered into contracts for the sale of our directory publishing business 
in november  we closed the sale of our directory publishing business in of the states in which we offered these services referred to as dex east 
in september  we completed the sale of the directory publishing business in the remaining states referred to as dex west 
as a consequence  the results of operations of our directory publishing business are included in income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be instructive for understanding the relevant trends going forward 
however  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  including the footnotes thereto 
our operating revenues are generated from our wireline  wireless and other services segments 
an overview of the segment results is provided in note segment information to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
segment discussions reflect the way we reported our segment results to our chief executive officer in and include revenue results for each of our customer channels within the wireline segment business  consumer and wholesale 
certain prior year revenue and expense amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentations 
business trends our results continue to be impacted by a number of factors influencing the telecommunications industry as follows industry competition is based primarily on pricing  packaging of services and features  quality of service and increasingly on meeting customer care needs 
we expect this trend to continue 
our on going response to industry competition has included initiatives to retain and win back customers by rolling out new or expanded services such as wireless  in region long distance  dsl  video and voip and the bundling of expanded feature rich products 
we expect technology substitution such as wireless substitution for wireline telephones  cable telephony substitution for wireline telephony and cable modem substitution for dial up modem lines and dsl to continue to cause additional access line losses 
we expect industry wide competitive factors to continue to impact our results  however  we believe our competitive position has improved due to recent rulings on une p that allow us to charge higher rates to other telecommunication providers and also due to changes in some of our competitors announced strategies 
our results continue to be impacted by regulatory responses to the competitive landscape for both our local and long distance services 
we expect business users of telecommunication services to increasingly want to receive all of their services from one provider 
results of operations overview our operating revenues are generated from the following three segments wireline services 
the wireline segment utilizes our traditional telephone and fiber optic broadband networks to provide voice services and data and internet services to consumer  business and wholesale customers 
our wireline services include voice services 
voice services revenue includes local voice services  long distance voice services and access services 
local voice services revenue includes revenue from basic local exchange services  switching services  custom calling features  enhanced voice services  operator services  collocation services and related equipment 
long distance voice services revenue includes revenue from interlata and intralata long distance services 
access services revenue includes fees charged to other long distance providers to connect to our network 
data and internet services 
data and internet services revenue includes data services  such as traditional private lines  wholesale private lines  frame relay  atm and related equipment  and internet services  such as dsl  dia  vpn  internet dial access  web hosting  professional services and related equipment 
wireless services 
we offer wireless services and equipment to residential and business customers  providing them the ability to use the same telephone number for their wireless phone as for their home or business phone 
in august  we entered into a services agreement with a subsidiary of sprint that allows us to resell sprint wireless services  including access to sprint s nationwide pcs wireless network  to consumer and business customers  primarily within our local service area states 
we began offering these sprint services under our brand name in march other services 
other services revenue is predominantly derived from the sublease of some of our unused real estate assets  such as space in our office buildings  warehouses and other properties 
as discussed above  until september  we operated a fourth segment  our directory publishing business which  as described in note assets held for sale including discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  has been classified as discontinued operations and accordingly is not presented in our segment results below

operating revenue although total operating revenue continued to decline in  we experienced a deceleration of revenue losses 
this is primarily due to increased sales of our consumer and wholesale long distance and consumer data and internet products 
the following table shows our access lines by channel as of december   and access lines percentage change years ended december  increase decrease v v v v in thousands consumer    business    wholesale    total    we may modify the channel classification of our access lines from time to time in our efforts to better approximate the related revenue channels and better reflect how we manage our business 
we believe that the deceleration in access line losses shown in this table was due in part to qwest corporation s and other ilecs success in achieving favorable regulatory rulings and the success of our customer service initiatives designed to provide our customers with improved service and expanded product offerings 
compared to the following table compares our operating revenue by segment including the detail of customer channels within our wireline segment percentage change years ended december  increase decrease v v dollars in millions wireline revenue voice services local voice business local voice   consumer local voice   wholesale local voice total local voice   long distance business long distance consumer long distance wholesale long distance  total long distance   access business access consumer access wholesale access total access  total voice services   data and internet business data and internet   consumer data and internet wholesale data and internet   total data and internet   total wireline revenue   wireless other services total operating revenue   wireline revenue historically  at least of our revenue comes from our wireline segment  which provides voice services and data and internet services as follows voice services local voice services 
the decrease in our local voice services revenue was primarily due to access line losses from competitive pressures and technology substitution and was also impacted by our customers migrating to our package offerings which generally offer lower pricing than our stand alone products 
in particular  for the past two years  a significant portion of the losses of our consumer and business access lines have been attributable to our competitors use of une p and unbundled local loops to deliver voice services 
these losses have been partially offset by corresponding increases in our wholesale access lines where une ps are reflected in our wholesale channel 
however  the regulated price structure of une ps applied downward pressure on our revenue 
on february   the fcc issued new unbundling rules eliminating the obligations that have required us to provide une p and unbundled switching as a une 
we believe this will lead to greater flexibility in negotiating contract rates with clecs and data access providers 
also  some of our competitors recently announced their intention to discontinue marketing consumer local voice services to new customers 
we believe these factors will help mitigate the downward pressure on wireline margins due to une p 
furthermore  although access line losses continue  the rate of loss of access lines has recently slowed 
we believe this slowing is due to the une p factors discussed previously 
long distance services 
the decrease in local voice services revenue was partially offset by an increase in long distance services revenue from our consumer and wholesale customers 
in january  we began to receive regulatory approval to offer long distance service in each state within our state region 
in the fourth quarter of  we received fcc approval for the last of our in region states 
as we received regulatory approval in each of the states  we began to increase the marketing and promotion of interlata long distance service to our customers  resulting in growth of in region long distance services revenue 
in total  million and million long distance subscribers were added in our state region in and  respectively 
in contrast  out of region long distance consumer and business revenue declined due to continuing competitive pressures  including pricing pressures  and our termination of certain customer agreements 
in our business channel  out of region revenue losses exceeded in region revenue gains 
wholesale long distance revenue increased due to increased international and domestic long distance call volume  partially offset by lower rates 
we expect that further increases in long distance revenue will offset some of the other expected revenue declines 
however  our long distance revenue is being negatively impacted by lower usage of long distance services by our out of region existing subscribers  which will moderate the anticipated increase in long distance revenue due to increased market penetration 
we also experienced growth in long distance revenues from our wholesale customers  however  the related costs are highly variable 
we have implemented pricing changes and are currently evaluating the pricing and terms of certain of these customer relationships as well as the manner in which the services are provided  in order to minimize future costs and improve operating margins 
access services 
the decrease in access services was primarily due to lower volumes resulting from our re entry into in region long distance as we became a competitor to our access services customers and access line losses 
data and internet services data and internet services revenue increased due to increases in our dsl  dia  internet hosting and vpn offerings  and broadband services continue to be expanded geographically to allow more of our customers to convert from dial up internet connections to our dsl services 
the number of consumer dsl subscribers grew by  and we expanded our dsl service area to of our local service area in  however  the impact of increases in consumer dsl subscribers and related revenue was offset in part by decreases in wholesale data and internet services 
wireless revenue the decrease in our wireless revenue is primarily attributable to a net loss of  or of subscribers in a portion of the loss of subscribers occurred in connection with the migration of our customers to the sprint network 
we responded in the fourth quarter of and implemented a plan to simplify the migration process for our customers 
the decrease in subscribers is also due to tightened credit policies 
we are now expanding our wireless offerings through our arrangement with sprint 
compared to the following table compares our operating revenue by segment including the detail of customer channels within our wireline segment percentage change years ended december  increase decrease v v wireline revenue voice services local voice business local voice   consumer local voice   wholesale local voice total local voice   long distance business long distance consumer long distance wholesale long distance total long distance   access business access consumer access wholesale access total access   total voice services   data and internet business data and internet   consumer data and internet wholesale data and internet   total data and internet   total wireline revenue   wireless other services total operating revenue    wireline revenue voice services local voice services 
the decrease in local voice revenue was driven by losses of access lines see table above as we experienced competition from both technology substitution and other telecommunications providers reselling our services by using une ps 
the regulated price structure of une ps also applied downward pressure on our revenue 
the increase in wholesale une p access lines partially offset the loss of retail access lines  but we also experienced declines in sales of enhanced features and installation and repair services in the consumer channel and in the business channel 
wholesale local voice revenue declined in and primarily due to reductions in demand for services such as operator assistance  pay phones  and collocation 
long distance services 
in  we evaluated specific long distance services sold primarily outside of our local service area 
based upon that evaluation  we de emphasized and stopped promoting certain products  including intralata long distance in the consumer and business markets and wholesale long distance  which resulted in a decline in both our and revenue 
however  in  we re entered the long distance market within our local service area and expanded our offerings to provide complementary local and long distance services 
as a result  although total long distance revenue declined  interlata long distance revenue within our service area increased due to the addition of million new subscribers  partially offsetting other long distance revenue declines 
access services 
access services revenue decreased primarily due to the access line losses described above  as well as the increase in the number of customers using our local service area long distance services which took away customers from our competitors who rely on our access services to provide long distance services 
in addition  in  we recorded a reserve  through a reduction of revenue  of million for anticipated customer credits resulting from regulatory rulings that redefined tariffs on local calls 
data and internet services data and internet services revenue was relatively flat with revenue increases in our internet products largely offset by declines in data services 
business channel revenue increased primarily due to increases in internet dial access and vpn 
pursuant to the amendment of our agreement with microsoft in july  we became responsible for providing broadband services directly to end user customers 
prior to that date we had provided these services to microsoft on a wholesale basis 
subsequent to that date we have recognized revenue at higher retail rates rather than the lower wholesale rates we charged microsoft 
we also increased our dsl subscriber base by and expanded our dsl service area to of our local service area in in addition  wholesale channel revenue declined primarily due to decreases in private data lines resulting from the bankruptcies of large customers such as touch america and mci 
wireless revenue revenue from wireless services decreased due to our decision in to de emphasize marketing of wireless services on a stand alone basis  coupled with tightened credit policies and intense industry competition 
although the wireless industry revenue grew in total in  our wireless revenue decreased from to  due in part to our limited ability to offer a competitive wireless product 
our wireless offerings  however  were expanded to allow the bundling of wireless and local voice services in august through our arrangement with sprint 
operating expenses operating expense trends our expenses continue to be impacted by shifting demand due to increased competition and the expansion of our product offerings 
these and other factors have led to some of the following trends affecting our operating expenses increased variable expenses 
expenses associated with our product offerings outside our local market and wireless tend to be more variable in nature 
while our traditional local market product offerings tend to rely upon our embedded cost structure  the mix of products we expect to sell  combined with regulatory and market pricing pressures  will continue to depress operating margins 
in addition  facility costs described below are not always reduced at the same rate that revenue declines due to long term contract commitments 
at the same time  local voice services revenue reductions have not resulted in a significant reduction of our network expenses or related employee costs due to our embedded cost structure 
improved facility costs 
facility costs are third party telecommunications expenses we incur to connect customers to networks or to end user product platforms not owned by us 
we have benefited in this area from the renegotiation  termination or settlement during and of various service arrangements  from network optimization initiatives and from regulatory approval allowing us to provide long distance services in our local service area using our own telecommunications equipment  thereby decreasing our reliance on third party providers 
however  these decreases are being partially offset by increases due to increased long distance traffic  consistent with increases in our in region international and wholesale long distance  as well as data and internet volumes and new wireless facility costs due to our sprint agreement 
pension and healthcare costs 
the combined costs of pension and healthcare are expected to rise modestly in the short term due to a net increase in amortization of previously identified actuarial benefits and losses 
reduced depreciation expense 
we experienced a reduction in the carrying value of certain assets in and to a much lesser extent and  resulting in the impairment charges discussed in note property  plant and equipment to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the impact of the  and impairments have cumulatively reduced our annual depreciation and amortization expenses by a total of approximately billion 
beginning in  we reduced capital expenditures and expect to continue at a reduced level for the foreseeable future 
this reduction has in turn led to a reduction in our depreciation and amortization expense 
given the current business environment as discussed in item of this report  we believe that our current level of capital expenditures will sustain our business at existing levels and support our anticipated core growth requirements in areas such as dsl  long distance and voip products 
compared to the following table provides further detail regarding our operating expenses percentage change years ended december  increase decrease v v dollars in millions operating expenses cost of sales facility costs   network expenses employee related costs   other non employee related costs total cost of sales   selling  general and administrative property and other taxes bad debt restructuring costs employee related costs   other non employee related costs   total selling  general and administrative   depreciation   capitalized software and other intangible assets amortization asset impairment charges total operating expenses   operating expenses cost of sales cost of sales includes employee related costs  such as salaries and wages directly attributable to products or services  and benefits  network facility costs and other non employee related costs such as facility costs  materials and supplies  contracted engineering services  computer system support and the cost of cpe sold 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in due to decreases in facility costs from the renegotiation  termination or settlement of service arrangements and network optimization initiatives 
these activities resulted in savings during the period of over million  of which approximately million were caused by one time termination charges in additionally  we experienced a decrease of approximately million as a result of reduction in our reliance on third party facility providers 
these additional decreases were more than offset by international  consumer and wholesale long distance volume increases  facility costs associated with the increase in long distance revenue in our local service area and commencement of usage of the sprint wireless network as we migrated our wireless customers 
the decrease in employee related costs is primarily due to employee reductions from our restructuring plans 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include employee related costs such as salaries and wages not directly attributable to products or services  restructuring charges  benefits and sales commissions and other non employee related costs such as transaction taxes  bad debt charges  rent for administrative space  advertising  professional service fees  real estate and computer systems support 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the million of charges recorded as other non employee related costs for litigation matters that are further discussed in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  as compared with a net charge of million for such items in these charges were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense primarily due to a favorable settlement of approximately million in the second quarter from a customer emerging from bankruptcy  and improved credit policies and collection processes  as well as a decrease in employee related expenses due to employee reductions 
decreases in property and other taxes are due to reduced property values as a result of our impairments 
the increase in restructuring costs is primarily due to our restructuring plan in which we reduced  employees in certain job functions  including information technology  network construction  customer installations  sales and back office areas  in response to continued declines in revenue and our plans for improved operational efficiencies 
million of the increase in restructuring costs is due to changes in sublease projections for idle real estate properties 
as a result of these restructuring activities  we expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately million 
the million increase in restructuring costs was more than offset by a million reduction in employee costs as a result of the restructuring 
this reduction is comprised of employee related costs of million in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expense in the statement of operations and million in lower capitalized employee expenditures 
the lower capitalized employee expenditures is primarily related to improved capital efficiencies due to a reduced demand for access lines  a slowdown of our dsl footprint expansion and a greater focus on our capital expansion programs 
pension and post retirement benefits our pension and post retirement benefit expense of million declined slightly from the expense of million 
this decrease was primarily due to a million benefit from recently passed medicare legislation that subsidizes the costs to employers of providing prescription drug coverage for their retirees 
this reduction was partially offset by lower expected returns on plan assets as we lowered our expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to 
for additional information on our pension and post retirement plans see note employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
operating expenses by segment segment expenses include employee related costs  facility costs  network expenses and other non employee related costs such as customer support  collections and marketing 
we manage indirect administrative services costs such as finance  information technology real estate and legal centrally  consequently  these costs are allocated to the other services segment 
we evaluate depreciation  amortization  interest expense  interest income  and other income expense on a total company basis 
as a result  these charges are not allocated to any segment 
similarly  we do not include impairment charges in the segment results 
our chief operating decision maker codm regularly reviews the results of operations at a segment level to evaluate the performance of each segment and allocate capital resources based on segment income

wireless operating expenses increased  primarily due to facility and network costs associated with the sprint agreement including usage costs and roaming costs on the sprint wireless network  development costs and handset costs associated with the migration 
other non employee related costs increased due to additional marketing and advertising costs as we aggressively marketed the new wireless products 
certain of these costs are not expected to continue as the migration of our customers onto the sprint nationwide pcs wireless network is substantially complete 
other services segment expense other services expenses include unallocated corporate expenses for direct services such as finance  information technology  legal  marketing services and human resources  which we centrally manage 
the following table sets forth additional expense information to provide greater detail as to the composition of the other services segment for the years of and percentage change years ended december  increase decrease v v dollars in millions other services expenses property and other taxes real estate costs restructuring costs employee related costs other non employee related costs   total other services expenses   certain immaterial expenses for facility costs  bad debt and network expenses in the other segment are grouped in other non employee related costs 
the increase in other services expense is primarily due to increased other non employee related costs attributable to the million of additional charges for litigation matters that are further discussed in more detail above in selling  general and administrative expenses and an increase in professional fees related to the outsourcing of our information technology services 
this increase was partially offset by lower hardware  software and maintenance costs resulting from such outsourcing 
partially offsetting the increase in other non employee related costs were lower employee related costs  attributable to decreases in salaries and wages and overtime related to our agreement to outsource certain information technology services  the restructuring of certain administrative functions and lower property and other taxes were due to changes in property tax estimates and a one time million expense reduction from a successful property tax appeal 
non segment operating expenses depreciation the decrease in depreciation from billion in to billion in was primarily the result of reduced capital expenditures beginning in in addition  asset impairment charges we recorded in and resulted in decreases in the depreciable basis of our fixed assets 
capitalized software and other intangible assets amortization the increase in amortization expense from million in to million in was attributable to the increase in total capitalized software 
asset impairment charges in conjunction with our efforts to sell certain assets during  we determined that the carrying amounts of those assets were in excess of our expected sales proceeds 
this  in addition to the abandonment of various leased long term network capacity routes  resulted in the asset impairment charge of million 
the asset impairment charges of million were due to the anticipated decrease in usage of our wireless network following the transition of our customers onto sprint s network 
for more information on our asset impairment charges  please see note property  plant and equipment to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
compared to the following table provides further detail regarding our operating expenses percentage change years ended december  increase decrease v v dollars in millions operating expenses cost of sales facility costs   network expenses employee related costs   other non employee related costs  total cost of sales   selling  general and administrative property and other taxes bad debt restructuring costs employee related costs   other non employee related costs   total selling  general and administrative   depreciation   capitalized software and other intangible assets amortization goodwill impairment charge   asset impairment charges   total operating expenses    operating expenses cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in primarily due to the increase in facility costs  which is attributable to over million of charges resulting from the termination of our services arrangements with calpoint and another service provider 
exclusive of these one time charges  facility costs would have decreased million  or  which reflected our focus on eliminating and renegotiating contracts 
also contributing to the increase in cost of sales was an increase in employee related costs  which was attributable to costs related to our pension and post retirement benefit plans 
these costs increased million due to lower expected and actual return on plan assets  lower discount rates and increased medical costs for plan participants 
partially offsetting the increase in facility costs and employee related costs was a decrease in non employee related costs associated with a decline in costs of cpe sold to customers corresponding with lower cpe revenue 
selling  general and administrative the primary cause of the reduction in selling  general and administrative was the decrease in other non employee related costs from reduced professional fees to third party vendors as we re incorporated certain previously outsourced customer service functions into our operations 
bad debt also decreased as a result of large provisions associated with uncollectible receivables from mci  touch america and others that we recorded in  improved collection practices and tighter credit policies in property and other taxes decreased primarily as a result of reduced property taxes  which resulted from lower asset valuations related to our impairments 
the partially offsetting increase in employee related costs resulted from increases in incentive compensation and increases related to our pension and post retirement benefit plans similar to the increase seen in cost of sales 
these increases were in turn partially offset by lower salaries and wages resulting from staffing reductions implemented in and as well as reduced sales commissions due to lower revenues and a revision to our sales compensation plan 
the decrease in restructuring costs is due to the provision of million offset by reversals of million of the provision compared to the provision of million offset by million of reversals of a portion of the provision 
the provision is primarily related to real estate exit costs 
pension and post retirement benefits the change to pension and post retirement benefit expense for of million from a credit of million in was due primarily to a million reduction in the expected return on plan assets from to  and million resulting from recognition of actuarial gains and losses

the increase in other services expense was primarily due to increases in employee related costs  which was primarily due to the increase in the combined benefits and post retirement plan expenses discussed above and increased employee incentive compensation costs 
offsetting the increase in employee related costs were other non employee related costs driven by a million net charge related to litigation  and a decrease in property and other taxes resulting from lower asset valuations 
non segment operating expenses depreciation the decrease in depreciation was primarily the result of the asset impairment charges we recorded as of june  and september  and the resulting decreases in the depreciable basis of our fixed assets 
these decreases resulted in the elimination of approximately billion in accumulated depreciation and reduced our annual depreciation and amortization expense by approximately billion  beginning july  capitalized software and other intangible assets amortization the decrease was primarily the result of the asset impairment charge we recorded as of june   which included an impairment charge of approximately billion to other intangible assets with finite lives  reducing the amortizable basis by that amount 
the impact of the impairment reduced our annual amortization expense by approximately million  beginning july  the impact of the discontinuance of amortization on indefinite lived intangibles reduced our annual amortization expense by approximately billion  beginning january  goodwill impairment charges as discussed in greater detail under critical accounting policies and estimates below  on january  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we reviewed our goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives for potential impairment based on the fair value of our entire enterprise using undiscounted cash flows 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill impairments be assessed based on allocating our goodwill to reporting units and comparing the net book value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below 
we performed a transitional impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on january  based on this analysis  we recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
of billion on january  changes in market conditions  downward revisions to our projections of future operating results and other factors indicated that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill should be evaluated for impairment as of june  based on the results of that impairment analysis  we determined that the remaining goodwill balance of billion was completely impaired and we recorded an impairment charge on june  to write off the remaining balance 
asset impairment charges asset impairment charges were million and billion in and  respectively 
the reason for the impairment charge  discussed in more detail in note property  plant and equipment to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  was a general deterioration of the telecommunications market in causing downward revisions to our expected future results 
this  and other factors  indicated that our investments in our long lived assets may have been impaired at that date 
therefore  we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets using gross undiscounted cash flow projections 
for the year ended december   we determined that the fair values were less than our carrying amounts by billion in the aggregate

interest expense net 
interest expense decreased primarily due to the significant pay down of debt in the fourth quarter of using cash proceeds from the sale of our directory business 
net gain on early retirement of debt 
the change was primarily attributable to the million gain due to the exchange of debt for shares of our common stock in other income net 
other income includes interest income  gains related to termination and settlements of agreements with certain vendors and customers  as well as other items 
gains on termination and settlements in were approximately million less than in income tax benefit our continuing operations effective tax benefit expense rate was in and in the decline in our income tax benefit is primarily due to a net charge to tax expense of million in  which was primarily for the million increase to our asset valuation allowance for the clas issue 
this increase was offset primarily by a reduction in our liability for other uncertain tax positions and investment tax credit amortization 
this and other related contingencies could require significant cash outlay if they are not successfully defended

interest expense 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction of our total outstanding debt by billion during a significant portion of these payments occurred in the fourth quarter of as a result of the timing of the reductions  there was only a minimal impact on interest expense for losses and impairment of investment in kpnqwest 
during  kpnqwest filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations 
as a result we wrote off the remaining billion of our investment 
for more information  please see note investments to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
loss on sale of investments and other investment write downs 
we recorded write downs of our investments for other than temporary declines of million and million for the years ended december  and additionally  during we sold various equity investments 
as a result of these sales we received approximately million in cash and recognized a loss of million 
we had no significant sales of investments in qwest owns an interest in qwest digital media  llc as discussed in note investments to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting 
we recorded a charge of million in the year ended december   representing primarily our equity share of losses in this investment 
net gain on early retirement of debt 
on december   we completed a cash tender offer for the purchase of billion aggregate face amount of outstanding debt of qwest  qwest services corporation  or qsc  and qcf for approximately billion in cash 
as a result  we recorded a loss of million on the early retirement of this debt 
in addition  during  we exchanged million of face amount of existing qcf and qwest communications corporation  or qcc  notes for million of cash and million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million 
as a result  a gain of million was recorded on the early retirement of this debt 
on december   we completed an offer to exchange up to billion in aggregate principal face amount of outstanding unsecured debt securities of qcf for new unsecured debt securities of qsc 
we received valid tenders of approximately billion in total principal amount of the qcf notes and issued in exchange approximately billion in face value of new debt securities of qsc 
the majority of these debt exchanges were accounted for as debt retirements resulting in the recognition of a billion gain 
the cash flows for two of the new debt securities were not considered substantially different than the exchanged debt and therefore no gain was realized upon exchange 
for these two debt instruments  the difference between the fair value of the new debt and the carrying amount of the exchanged debt of approximately million was recorded as a premium and is being amortized as a credit to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the new debt 
other income net 
in we recorded gains totaling million related to the early termination of services contracts and iru arrangements with certain customers 
under these arrangements  we received cash up front and we were recognizing revenue over the multi year terms of the related agreements 
in these cases where the customers elected to terminate the agreements prior to their contractual end and we had no continuing obligations  we recognized the remaining portion of the deferred revenue as other income as of the termination date 
income tax benefit our continuing operations effective tax benefit rate was in and in our effective tax benefit rate was less than the expected rate of because of an increase in the valuation allowance of million 
our effective tax benefit increased primarily because included significant non deductible impairments that were not included in our income tax benefit 
our effective tax benefit rate also decreased  due to the non deductible charges we recorded related to the impairment of our goodwill and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recorded in the second quarter of we recorded a non cash charge of billion to establish a valuation allowance against the net federal and state deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
our losses in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance beginning in we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the federal and state deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities 
in the future  until we generate taxable income  we do not expect to record any significant net tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations 
income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations net of tax income from discontinued operations for both and was predominately related to our directory publishing business  dex  and has been adjusted to reflect a change in the composition of our other discontinued operations 
the increase in income from discontinued operations in is primarily the result of the completion of the sale of the dex west business resulting in a gain on sale of billion billion after tax 
in income from discontinued operations was primarily the result of the completion of the sale of the dex east business resulting in a gain on sale of billion billion after tax 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net of tax in  we recognized a gain of million net of million tax from the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
in  we recognized a loss of billion no tax effect from the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
liquidity and capital resources near term view our working capital deficit  or the amount by which our current liabilities exceed our current assets  was million and billion as of december  and  respectively 
our working capital deficit was reduced substantially in as a result of our issuing long term debt in february  august and november  which provided sufficient cash for us to retire our current maturities 
additionally  current assets increased by million due to our reclassification of certain long term assets to assets held for sale as discussed in note assets held for sale including discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
these favorable declines were partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable due to lower sales and improved collections on customer accounts 
we believe that our cash on hand together with our cash flows from operations and available cash flows from sale of investments and assets held for sale should be sufficient to meet our cash needs through the next twelve months 
however  if we become subject to significant judgments  settlements or tax payments  such as the potential clas obligation  as further discussed in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  we could be required to make significant payments that we do not have the resources to make 
the magnitude of any settlements or judgments resulting from these actions could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and our financial condition  potentially impacting our credit ratings  our ability to access capital markets and our compliance with debt covenants 
in addition  the magnitude of any settlements or judgments may cause us to draw down significantly on our cash balances  which might force us to obtain additional financing or explore other methods to generate cash 
such methods could include issuing additional securities or selling assets 
to the extent that our ebitda as defined in our debt covenants is reduced by cash judgments or settlements  our debt to consolidated ebitda ratios under certain debt agreements will be adversely affected 
in addition  the three year revolving credit facility established by qwest services corporation qsc in the qsc credit facility contains various limitations  including a restriction on using any proceeds from the facility to pay settlements or judgments relating to investigations and securities actions discussed in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the wireline segment provides over of our total operating revenue with the balance attributed to wireless and other services segments 
accordingly  the wireline segment provides nearly all of the consolidated cash flows from operations 
cash flows used in operations of our wireless segment are not expected to be significant in the near term 
cash flows used in operations of our other services segment are significant  however  we expect that the cash flows provided by the wireline segment will be sufficient to fund these operations in the near term 
we expect that our capital expenditures will approximate levels  with the majority being used in our wireline segment 
long term view we have historically operated with a working capital deficit as a result of our highly leveraged position  however  as mentioned previously  in we experienced a favorable decline in our working capital deficit of billion primarily due to our ability to retire current maturities of our debt 
we believe that cash provided by operations  combined with our current cash position and continued access to capital markets to refinance our debt should allow us to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to our periodic need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due  we may also need to obtain additional financing or investigate other methods to generate cash such as further cost reductions or the sale of assets if cash provided by operations does not improve  if revenue and cash provided by operations continue to decline  if economic conditions weaken  if competitive pressures increase or if we become subject to judgments and or settlements and tax payments  such as the potential clas obligation  significantly in excess of our recorded reserve as further discussed in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
in the event of an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters  we could be required to make significant payments that we do not have the resources to make 
the magnitude of any settlements or judgments resulting from these actions could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and our financial condition  potentially impacting our credit ratings  our ability to access capital markets and our compliance with debt covenants 
in addition  the magnitude of any settlements or judgments may cause us to draw down significantly on our cash balances  which might force us to obtain additional financing or explore other methods to generate cash 
such methods could include issuing additional securities or selling assets 
the qsc credit facility makes available to us million of additional credit 
this facility has a cross payment default provision  and this facility and certain other debt issues also have cross acceleration provisions 
when present  such provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument 
these provisions generally provide that a cross default under these debt instruments could occur if we fail to pay any indebtedness when due in an aggregate principal amount greater than million  any indebtedness is accelerated in an aggregate principal amount greater than million million in the case of one of the debt instruments  or judicial proceedings are commenced to foreclose on any of our assets that secure indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount greater than million 
upon such a cross default  the creditors of a material amount of our debt may elect to declare that a default has occurred under their debt instruments and to accelerate the principal amounts due such creditors 
cross acceleration provisions are similar to cross default provisions  but permit a default in a second debt instrument to be declared only if in addition to a default occurring under the first debt instrument  the indebtedness due under the first debt instrument is actually accelerated 
in addition  the qsc credit facility contains various limitations  including a restriction on using any proceeds from the facility to pay settlements or judgments relating to investigations and securities actions discussed in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
payment obligations and contingencies payment obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period thereafter total dollars in millions future contractual obligations long term debt    interest on debt      capital lease and other obligations operating leases   subtotal       purchase commitment obligations telecommunications commitments iru operating and maintenance obligations advertising and promotion services  total purchase commitment obligations total future contractual obligations    the table does not include our open purchase orders as of december  these are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are cancelable without penalty and are part of normal operations 
this table does not include accounts payable of million  accrued expenses and other current liabilities of billion  and other long term liabilities of billion all of which are recorded on our december  consolidated balance sheet 
we have various long term  non cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services  including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and events 
we also have service related commitments with various vendors for data processing  technical and software support 
future payments under certain services contracts will vary depending on our actual usage 
in the table above we estimated payments for these service contracts based on the level of services we expect to use 
interest expense in all years will differ due to future refinancing of debt 
interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for all years using the rates effective as of december  employee benefit plans 
we offer post retirement benefits to our employees  some of which are due under contractual agreements 
pension and certain post retirement benefits are paid through trusts and therefore are not included in this table as we are not able to reliably estimate future required contributions to the trusts 
as of december   our qualified defined benefit pension plan was fully funded 
as of december   we recorded a liability on our balance sheet of billion for post retirement and other post employment benefit obligations 
the liability is impacted by various actuarial assumptions and will differ from the sum of the future value of actuarially estimated payment 
for further discussion of our benefit plans see note employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
purchase commitment obligations 
we have telecommunications commitments with clecs  ixcs and third party vendors that require us to make payments to purchase network services  capacity and telecommunications equipment 
these commitments generally require us to maintain minimum monthly and or annual billings  based on usage 
included in the telecommunications commitments are purchase commitments that we entered into with kmc in connection with sales of equipment to kmc 
at that time we also entered into facilities management services agreements with them 
in connection with the kmc arrangements  we also agreed to pay the monthly service fees directly to trustees that serve as paying agents on debt instruments issued by special purpose entities sponsored by kmc 
our remaining purchase obligations under these agreements totaled million as of december  these unconditional purchase obligations require us to pay at least or million as of december   of the monthly service fees for the entire term of the agreements  regardless of whether kmc provides us services 
however  we are in dispute with kmc over additional potential amounts 
please see legal proceedings in item of this report for more information regarding this dispute 
a portion of our fiber optic broadband network includes facilities that were purchased or are leased from third parties in the form of irus 
these agreements are generally to years in length and generally include the requirement for us to pay operating and maintenance fees to a third party for the term of the agreement 
letters of credit at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
historical view operating activities we generated cash from operating activities of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the decrease in cash provided by continuing operating activities compared to resulted primarily from a million decrease in cash generated from continuing operating activities after adjusting for non cash items including depreciation  amortization  impairment  and million in increased charges to legal reserves 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities reflects the continued decline in profitability as a result of declining revenues and product mix changes to the sale of products with more variable costs associated with them 
in addition  the company made a payment of million related to the sec settlement and made tax payments in of million versus receiving tax refunds of million in the million decrease in cash provided by continuing operating activities in compared to resulted primarily from an increase in loss from continuing operations of billion after adjusting for non cash items including depreciation  amortization and asset impairments 
the decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the continued trend of decreasing revenues 
investing activities cash used for investing activities was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
cash used for investing activities during decreased compared to the same period ended primarily as a result of a million decrease in expenditures for property plant and equipment and million in proceeds from the sale of investments 
we believe that our current level of capital expenditures will sustain our business at existing levels and support our anticipated core growth requirements in areas such as dsl  long distance and voip products 
financing activities cash used for financing activities was million  billion and million in  and  respectively 
during  we received an aggregate of billion in proceeds from the issuance of new long term borrowings and repaid an aggregate of billion in borrowings 
at december   we were in compliance with all provisions or covenants of our borrowings 
see note borrowings to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information on our and historical financing activities as well as additional information regarding the covenants of our existing debt instruments 
we paid no dividends in credit ratings the table below summarizes our long term debt ratings at december  and december  december  moody s s p fitch moody s s p fitch corporate rating sr 
implied rating b bb na na b na qwest corporation ba bb bb ba b b qwest services corporation caa b b nr ccc nr qwest communications corporation nr b b caa ccc ccc qwest capital funding  inc caa b b caa ccc ccc qwest communications international inc b caa caa b b b caa ccc ccc na not applicable nr not rated qcii notes have various ratings on january   moody s assigned a senior implied rating of b to qwest and a b rating to the new qwest senior notes guaranteed by qsc issued in february they also assigned a b rating to the qsc credit facility and a caa rating to the senior subordinated notes of qsc 
at the same time  moody s confirmed ratings of other entities and lowered the rating on qcii s outstanding unguaranteed senior secured notes to caa on march   s p assigned a b to the qsc credit facility 
in june  s p and fitch raised their ratings on qwest and its affiliates as reflected in the table above 
in addition  s p and fitch raised their rating on the qsc credit facility to bb 
with respect to moody s  a ba rating is judged to have speculative elements  meaning that the future of the issuer cannot be considered to be well assured 
often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate  and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times 
issuers with caa ratings are in poor standing with moody s 
these issuers may be in default  according to moody s  or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal and interest 
the  modifiers show relative standing within the major categories  being the highest  or best  modifier in terms of credit quality 
with respect to s p  any rating below bbb indicates that the security is speculative in nature 
a bb rating indicates that the issuer currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  however  it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb  but the obligor currently has capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
adverse business  financial  or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the plus and minus symbols show relative standing within the major categories 
with respect to fitch  any rating below bbb is considered speculative in nature 
a bb rating indicates that there is a possibility of credit risk developing  particularly as the result of adverse economic change over time  however  business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met 
a b rating indicates that significant credit risk is present  but a limited margin of safety remains 
financial commitments are currently being met  however  capacity for continued payment is contingent upon a sustained  favorable business and economic environment 
the plus and minus symbols show relative standing within major categories 
debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agency s opinion of the ability of the issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due 
in general  lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and or impaired ability to borrow 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
given our current credit ratings  as noted above  our ability to raise additional capital under acceptable terms and conditions may be negatively impacted 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations  either past or present 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
these policies and estimates are considered critical because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements  and because they require significant judgments  assumptions or estimates 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions made when accounting for items and matters such as future usage under long term contracts  customer retention patterns  collectibility of accounts receivable  expected economic duration of assets to be depreciated or amortized  asset valuations  internal labor capitalization rates  recoverability of assets  rates of return on assets held for employee benefits  timing and amounts of future employee benefit payments  uncertain tax positions  reserves and other provisions and contingencies are reasonable  based on information available at the time they are made 
however  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
policies and estimates materially impacting current or future results of operations loss contingencies and litigation reserves we are involved in several material legal proceedings  as described in more detail in item legal proceedings in this report 
we assess potential losses in relation to these and other pending or threatened legal and income tax matters 
for matters not related to income taxes  if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we recognize an expense for the estimated loss 
for income tax related matters  we record a liability computed at the statutory income tax rate if we determine that i we do not believe that we are more likely than not to prevail on an uncertainty related to the timing of recognition for an item  or ii we do not believe that it is probable that we will prevail and the uncertainty is not related to the timing of recognition 
the overall tax liability also considers the anticipated utilization of any applicable tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
to the extent these estimates turn out to exceed or be less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of such matters  our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly and if the differences are material  our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted 
revenue recognition and related reserves revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided 
up front fees received  primarily activation fees and installation charges  as well as the associated customer acquisition costs  are deferred and recognized over the expected customer relationship period  generally one to ten years 
payments received in advance are deferred until the service is provided 
customer arrangements that include both equipment and services are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence 
if the elements are deemed separable  total consideration is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the separate elements and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned 
if the elements are not deemed separable  total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are critical accounting estimates because i they require management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers  ii the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective  iii the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material  and iv the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable may result in revenues being reported in different periods than significant portions of the related costs 
as the telecommunications market experiences greater competition and customers shift from traditional land based telephony services to wireless and internet based services  our estimated customer relationship periods could decrease and we will accelerate the recognition of deferred revenue over a shorter estimated customer relationship period 
restructuring periodically  we commit to exit certain business activities  eliminate office or facility locations and or reduce our number of employees 
the charge to record such a decision depends upon various assumptions  including future severance payments  sublease income  length of time on market for abandoned rented facilities  contractual termination costs and so forth 
such estimates are inherently judgmental and may change materially based upon actual experience 
the estimate of future losses on sublease income and disposal activity generally involves the most significant judgment 
due to the estimates and judgments involved in the application of each of these accounting policies  changes in our plans and these estimates and market conditions could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
economic lives of assets to be depreciated or amortized due to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment  selecting the estimated economic life of telecommunications plant  equipment and software requires a significant amount of judgment 
we regularly review data on utilization of equipment  asset retirements and salvage values to determine adjustments to our depreciation rates 
as of december   the weighted average remaining expected life of our property  plant and equipment was years 
the effect of a one year increase in the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment would have decreased our depreciation expense by approximately million  the effect of a one year decrease in the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment would have increased our depreciation expense by approximately million 
as of december   the weighted average remaining expected life of our intangibles assets with finite lives was years 
the effect of a one year increase in the estimated useful lives of our intangibles assets with finite lives would have decreased our amortization expense by approximately million  the effect of a one year decrease in the estimated useful lives of our intangibles assets with finite lives would have increased our amortization expense by approximately million 
pension and post retirement benefits pension and post retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits earned by employees during the year  as well as interest on projected benefit obligations  are accrued currently 
prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 
pension and post retirement costs are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits as determined using the projected unit credit method 
in computing the pension and post retirement benefit costs  we must make numerous assumptions about such things as employee mortality and turnover  salary and wage increases  discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets  expected future cost increases and negotiated caps on reimbursable costs 
two of these items generally have the most significant impact on the level of cost the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
annually  we set our discount rate primarily based upon the yields on high quality fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
in making this determination we consider  among other things  the yields on moody s aa corporate bonds and the citigroup pension liability index as of year end 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is the long term rate of return we expect to earn on the trust assets 
the rate of return is determined by the investment composition of the plan assets and the long term risk and return forecast for each asset category 
the forecasts for each asset class are generated using historical information as well as an analysis of current and expected market conditions 
the expected risk and return characteristics for each asset class are reviewed annually and revised  as necessary  to reflect changes in the financial markets 
we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan  or the pension plan  for substantially all management and occupational union employees 
to compute the expected return on pension plan assets  we apply an expected rate of return to the market related asset value of the pension plan assets 
the market related asset value is a computed value that recognizes changes in fair value of pension plan equity assets over a period of time  not to exceed five years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  we elected to recognize actual returns on our pension plan assets ratably over a five year period when computing our market related value of pension plan assets 
this method has the effect of reducing the impact on expense from annual market volatility that may be experienced from year to year 
changes in any of the assumptions we made in computing the pension and post retirement benefit costs could have a material impact on various components that comprise these expenses 
factors to be considered include the strength or weakness of the investment markets  changes in the composition of the employee base  fluctuations in interest rates  significant employee hirings or downsizings and medical cost trends 
changes in any of these factors could impact cost of sales and sg a in the consolidated statement of operations as well as the value of the asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
if our assumed expected rate of return of for was basis points lower  the impact would have been to increase the net pension expense by million 
if our assumed discount rate of for were basis points lower  the impact would have been to increase the net expense by million 
the pension plan accumulated benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of a certain date 
if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds plan assets and at least this amount has not been accrued  an additional minimum liability must be recognized 
annually  we evaluate our plan to determine whether any additional minimum liability is required 
recoverability of long lived assets due to our ongoing losses  we periodically perform evaluations of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets using gross undiscounted cash flow projections 
these evaluations require identification of the lowest level of identifiable  largely independent  cash flows for purposes of grouping assets and liabilities subject to review 
the cash flow projections include long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
all of these items require significant judgment and assumptions 
we believe our estimates are reasonable  based on information available at the time they were made 
however  if our estimates of our future cash flows had been different  we may have concluded that some of our long lived assets were not recoverable  which would likely have caused us to record a material impairment charge 
also  if our future cash flows are significantly lower than our projections we may determine at some future date that some of our long lived assets are not recoverable 
policies and estimates primarily impacting past results of operations goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted sfas no 
in january  which requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
instead  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment upon adoption on january  and at least annually thereafter 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we performed our initial impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  the implementation involved the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  where a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below 
we estimated the fair value of each significant reporting unit based on discounted forecasts of future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions were required in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
two of the most significant assumptions underlying the determination of the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets upon our initial implementation were the cash flow forecasts and discount rates used 
in connection with the measurement we performed at the date we adopted sfas no 
january   we determined that a increase in the cash flow forecasts would have decreased the transitional impairment charge by approximately billion  resulting in a transitional impairment charge of approximately billion instead of billion 
in contrast  a decrease in the cash flow forecasts would have increased the transitional impairment charge by approximately billion  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately billion 
a basis point increase in the discount rate we used would have resulted in a transitional impairment charge of approximately billion instead of billion  while a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have resulted in a transitional impairment charge of approximately billion 
subsequent to adoption of sfas no 
on january   we determined that circumstances indicated it was more likely than not that an impairment loss was incurred  and as a result  we tested the remaining goodwill for possible impairment 
our impairment analysis as of june   resulted in an impairment of the remaining goodwill of approximately billion 
as a result of recording the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for the transitional impairment of billion and the additional impairment of billion  there is no goodwill remaining on our balance sheet as of and subsequent to june  thus  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value estimates used in our june  measurement would have had no impact on the impairment recorded 
impairments of long lived assets pursuant to the services agreement with sprint that allows us to resell sprint wireless services  our wireless customers who were serviced through our proprietary wireless network were to be transitioned onto sprint s network 
due to the anticipated decrease in usage of our own wireless network following the transition of our customers onto sprint s network  in the third quarter of we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived wireless network assets 
we compared gross undiscounted cash flow projections to the carrying value of the long lived wireless network assets and determined that certain asset groups were not expected to be recovered through future projected cash flows 
for those asset groups that were not recoverable  we then estimated the fair value using estimates of market prices for similar assets 
cell sites  switches  related tools and equipment inventory and certain information technology systems that support the wireless network were determined to be impaired by million 
estimating the fair value of the asset groups involved significant judgment and a variety of assumptions 
comparable market data was obtained by reviewing recent sales of similar asset types 
the price allocated to these assets in our subsequent agreement to sell the assets to verizon indicates that the ultimate proceeds from the sale of the assets will differ from our estimate by an immaterial amount 
however  the sale of the assets has not closed and remains subject to adjustment 
effective june   the general deterioration of the telecommunications market  the downward revisions to our expected future results of operations and other factors indicated that our investments in long lived assets may have been impaired at that date 
we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets using gross undiscounted cash flow projections 
for impairment analysis purposes  we grouped our property  plant and equipment and projected cash flows as follows traditional telephone network  national fiber optic broadband network  international fiber optic broadband network  wireless network  web hosting and asp  assets held for sale  and out of region dsl 
based on this assessment of recoverability  we concluded that our traditional telephone network was not impaired 
however  this analysis revealed that the remaining asset groups were impaired 
we then estimated the fair value of these asset groups and  as a result  we recorded a total of billion in asset impairment charges during the year ended december  as more fully described below 
following is a summary of impairment charges recognized by asset group for the year ended december  net of million for certain web hosting centers that have been reclassified to income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations to our consolidated statements of operations in item of this report 
asset group impairment charge fair value methodology dollars in millions national fiber optic broadband network  discounted cash flows international fiber optic broadband network comparable market data wireless network comparable market data and discounted cash flows web hosting and asp assets comparable market data assets held for sale comparable market data out of region dsl discounted cash flows total impairment charges  the national fiber optic broadband network provides long distance voice services  data and internet services  and wholesale services to business  consumer and wholesale customers outside of our local service area 
the international fiber optic broadband network provides the same services to the same types of customers only outside of the united states 
the wireless network provides pcs in select markets in our local service area 
our web hosting and asp asset group provides business customers both shared and dedicated hosting on our servers as well as application hosting services to help design and manage the customer s website and their hosting applications 
assets held for sale primarily consist of excess network supplies 
our out of region dsl assets provide dsl service to customers outside our local service area 
calculating the estimated fair value of the asset groups as listed above involves significant judgments and a variety of assumptions 
for calculating fair value based on discounted cash flows  we forecasted future operating results and future cash flows  which included long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
we also used a discount rate based on an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital for the specific asset groups as of june  comparable market data was obtained by reviewing recent sales of similar asset types in third party market transactions 
relative to the above excluding the wireless network  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the estimated future cash flows of would have changed the impairment charge by approximately million 
also excluding wireless  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the discount rate used of basis points would have changed the impairment charge by approximately million 
in respect to the wireless assets  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the current cost factors would have changed the impairment charge by million 
also relative to the wireless assets  a hypothetical basis point change in the discount factors related to physical deterioration  functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence would have changed the impairment charge by million 
asset retirement obligations we have network assets located in leased properties such as equipment rooms  central offices  and wireless sites 
for certain of these leases  we are legally obligated to remove our equipment when the lease expires 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  we record a liability for the estimated current fair value of the costs associated with these removal obligations 
we estimate our removal liabilities using historical cost information  industry factors  and current engineering estimates 
we then estimate the present value of these costs by discounting the future expected cash payout to current fair value based on our incremental borrowing rate 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimated and actual removal costs  and our estimated and actual discount rates  we could be required to adjust our recorded liabilities at that time 
these estimates were critical factors in determining the net income impact of million upon the adoption of sfas no 
in recently adopted accounting pronouncements and cumulative effect of adoption we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r in the first quarter of fin r requires an evaluation of three additional criteria to determine if consolidation is required 
these criteria are whether the entity is a variable interest entity  whether the company holds a variable interest in the entity  and whether the company is the primary beneficiary of the entity 
if all three of these criteria are met  consolidation is required 
upon adoption of fin r  we identified two relationships that may be subject to consolidation by us under the provisions of fin r 
both relationships are with groups of entities that provide internet port access and services to their customers 
the first relationship is with special purpose entities created and wholly owned by kmc telecom holdings  inc the kmc entities 
our previously disclosed service contracts and consent agreements with the kmc entities may be variable interests under fin r 
we do not currently have sufficient information about the special purpose entities to complete our analysis under fin r 
we have continuously requested this information  but have not received sufficient information to complete our analysis 
until further information about their financial statements and capitalization is available to us  we are unable to come to any conclusion under fin r 
our maximum exposure to loss related to the kmc entities is the total remaining amount due under our service contracts  which was approximately million as of december  payments made under our service contracts  which are included in cost of sales  were million  million and million  respectively  for the periods ended december   and see note commitment and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a discussion of additional potential loss exposure related to kmc 
we previously recorded a liability and charge associated with our relationship with the second entity 
we do not currently have sufficient information about this entity to complete our analysis under fin r 
we have requested the information  however the management of this entity has stated that financial information is not readily available and has thus far not provided any of the requested information 
until further information about the entity s financial statements and capitalization is available to us  we are unable to come to any conclusion under fin r 
as a result of previously recording a liability and charge associated with this relationship  we believe that our exposure to loss  excluding interest accretion  has been reflected in our financial statements 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of the act became law in the united states 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit 
we adopted the provisions of fasb staff position no 
fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of 
accounting for the government subsidy provided under the act reduced our accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million 
the act reduced the prescription drug expense component of our post retirement benefit expenses by million

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for intangible assets excluding goodwill acquired individually or with a group of other assets at the time of their acquisition 
it also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
as required  we adopted sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 the fair value of goodwill was evaluated as of january  as if an acquisition of each of our reporting units at fair value had occurred on that date 
the valuation was based on our reporting units at that date 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below 
the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 
was a loss from a change in accounting principle of billion 
the adoption of sfas no 
reduced our amortization expense for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets by approximately billion annually  beginning january  the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill as of january  see note goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further information 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
under sfas no 
 long lived assets being held or used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable from their expected future undiscounted cash flows a triggering event 
the impairment loss is equal to the difference between the asset s carrying amount and estimated fair value 
in addition  sfas no 
requires long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale for cash to be accounted for and reported like assets being held and used 
long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are to be recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell at the time the plan of disposition has been approved and committed to by the appropriate company management 
see note property  plant and equipment to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further information 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the interim reporting period beginning july  sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
however  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which is effective for qwest starting july  in the past  we were frequently required to measure the value of assets exchanged in non monetary transactions by using the net book value of the asset relinquished 
under sfas no 
 we will measure assets exchanged at fair value  as long as the transaction has commercial substance and the fair value of the assets exchanged is determinable within reasonable limits 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
risk management we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates 
the objective of our interest rate risk management program is to manage the level and volatility of our interest expense 
we may employ derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure 
we may also employ financial derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposures associated with particular debt 
we entered into interest rate swap agreements in the notational amount of million in to manage exposure to interest rate movements and to optimize our mixture of floating and fixed rate debt while minimizing liquidity risk 
the weighted average effective floating interest rate on the agreements is libor plus 
the interest rate swap agreements were designated as fair value hedges  which effectively convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate through the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments 
the impact on interest expense in was minimal 
as of december  and  approximately billion of floating rate debt was exposed to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is linked to libor 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in libor rates would increase annual pre tax interest expense by million 
as of december   we also had approximately billion of long term fixed rate debt obligations maturing in the following months 
any new debt obtained to refinance this debt will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical or basis point increase in the interest rates on this debt would not have had a material effect on our earnings 
as of december   we had billion of cash and cash equivalents invested primarily in money market and other short term investments 
in addition  we had approximately million in other short and long term investments 
most cash is invested at floating rates 
as interest rates change so will the interest income derived from these accounts 
special note regarding forward looking statements this form k contains or incorporates by reference forward looking statements 
these statements include  among others statements concerning the benefits that we expect will result from our business activities and certain transactions we have completed  such as increased revenue  decreased expenses and avoided expenses and expenditures  and statements of our expectations  beliefs  future plans and strategies  anticipated developments and other matters that are not historical facts 
these statements may be made expressly in this document or may be incorporated by reference to other documents we will file with the sec 
you can find many of these statements by looking for words such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions used in this report or incorporated by reference in this report 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by us in those statements 
some of these risks are described below under risk factors 
these risk factors should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue 
we do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
further  the information contained in this document is a statement of our intention as of the date of this filing and is based upon  among other things  the existing regulatory environment  industry conditions  market conditions and prices  the economy in general and our assumptions as of such date 
we may change our intentions  at any time and without notice  based upon any changes in such factors  in our assumptions or otherwise 
risk factors risks affecting our business we face pressure on profit margins as a result of increasing competition  including product substitution  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial performance 
we compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market  and we expect competition to intensify 
we have faced greater competition in our core local business from cable companies  wireless providers including ourselves  facilities based providers using their own networks as well as those leasing parts of our network unbundled network elements  and resellers 
regulatory developments have generally increased competitive pressures on our business  such as the november decision allowing for number portability from wireline to wireless phones 
due to these and other factors  we believe competitive telecommunications providers are no longer hindered by historical barriers to entry 
as a result  we are seeking to distinguish ourselves from our competitors through a number of customer service initiatives 
these initiatives include expanded product bundling  simplified billing  improved customer support and other ongoing measures 
however  these initiatives are new and unproven 
we may not have sufficient resources to distinguish our service levels from those of our competitors  and we may not be successful in integrating our product offerings  especially products for which we act as a reseller  such as sprint s wireless services and the video services of a satellite provider 
even if we are successful  these initiatives may not be sufficient to offset our continuing loss of access lines 
please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this report for more information regarding trends affecting our access lines 
we have also begun to experience and expect further increased competitive pressure from telecommunications providers either emerging from bankruptcy protection  consolidating with other providers or reorganizing their capital structure to more effectively compete against us 
as a result of these increased competitive pressures  we have been and may continue to be forced to respond with lower profit margin product offerings and pricing schemes in an effort to retain and attract customers 
these pressures could adversely affect our operating results and financial performance 
rapid changes in technology and markets could require substantial expenditure of financial and other resources in excess of contemplated levels  and any inability to respond to those changes could reduce our market share 
the telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological changes  and our ability to execute our business plans and compete depends upon our ability to develop new products and accelerate the deployment of advanced new services  such as broadband data  wireless services  video services and voip services 
the development and deployment of new products could require substantial expenditure of financial and other resources in excess of contemplated levels 
if we are not able to develop new products to keep pace with technological advances  or if such products are not widely accepted by customers  our ability to compete could be adversely affected and our market share could decline 
any inability to keep up with changes in technology and markets could also adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our ability to service our debt 
if we are not able to stem the loss of our access lines or grow other areas of our business to compensate for these losses  our revenue will continue to decline 
our revenue decline over the past few years is largely attributable to our continued loss of access lines  which is a result of increased competition and technology substitution such as wireless and cable substitution for wireline telephony 
we are seeking to improve our competitive position through product bundling and other sales and marketing initiatives 
however  we may not be successful in these efforts 
if we are not successful and our revenue declines materially without corresponding cost reductions  this will cause a material deterioration to our results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our ability to service debt and pay other obligations 
risks relating to legal and regulatory matters any adverse outcome of the major lawsuits pending against us  the investigation currently being conducted by the us attorney s office or the assessment being undertaken by the gsa could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results  on the trading price of our debt and equity securities and on our ability to access the capital markets 
the investigations and securities actions described in item legal proceedings of this report present material and significant risks to us 
in many of the securities actions  the plaintiffs seek tens of millions of dollars in damages or more  and in one putative class action lawsuit  lead counsel for the plaintiffs has indicated that plaintiffs will seek damages in the tens of billions of dollars 
for a description of these and other significant legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings of this report 
the outcomes in any cases which have been or may be brought by the us attorney s office or the sec against former officers or employees may have a negative impact on the outcome of certain of these legal actions 
further  the size  scope and nature of the restatements of our consolidated financial statements for and  which are described in our form k a  affect the risks presented by these investigations and actions  as these matters involve  among other things  our prior accounting practices and related disclosures 
plaintiffs in certain of the securities actions have alleged our restatement of items in support of their claims 
we can give no assurance as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition that may ultimately result from all of these matters 
as we have previously disclosed  during and  we recorded reserves in our financial statements totaling million in connection with the investigations and securities actions 
the million reserve was reduced by million in december as a result of a payment in that amount in connection with a settlement in october of the sec s investigation of us 
the remaining reserve amount represents a final payment to be made in connection with the sec settlement in the amount of million and the minimum estimated amount of loss we believe is probable with respect to the securities actions 
however  the ultimate outcomes of these matters are still uncertain and there is a significant possibility that the amount of loss we ultimately incur could be substantially more than the reserve we have provided 
if the recorded reserve that will remain after we have paid the amount owed under the sec settlement is insufficient to cover these matters  we will need to record additional charges to our statement of operations in future periods 
an adverse outcome with respect to the us attorney s office investigation or the gsa evaluation could have a material and significant adverse impact upon us 
additionally  we continue to defend against the securities actions vigorously and are currently unable to provide any estimate as to the timing of the resolution of these actions 
any settlement of or judgment in one or more of these actions substantially in excess of our recorded reserves could have a significant impact on us  and we can give no assurance that we will have the resources available to pay any such judgment 
the magnitude of any settlement or judgment resulting from these actions could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and our financial condition  potentially impacting our credit ratings  our ability to access capital markets and our compliance with debt covenants 
in addition  the magnitude of any settlement or judgment may cause us to draw down significantly on our cash balances  which might force us to obtain additional financing or explore other methods to generate cash 
such methods could include issuing additional securities or selling assets 
further  given the size and nature of our business  we are subject from time to time to various other lawsuits which  depending on their outcome  may have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
thus  we can give no assurances as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition as a result of these matters 
continued scrutiny of our financial disclosures could reduce investor confidence and cause the trading price of our securities to decline 
as a result of our accounting issues and the increased scrutiny of financial disclosure  investor confidence in us has suffered and could suffer further 
as discussed earlier  the us attorney s office is currently conducting an investigation of  without limitation  transactions related to the various adjustments and restatements described in our form k a  transactions between us and certain of our vendors  and certain investments in the securities of those vendors by individuals associated with us  and certain disclosures made by us 
although  as described above  we have entered into a settlement with the sec concerning its investigation of us  the sec continues to investigate the conduct of individuals 
a criminal trial of four former employees concluded in april  resulting in the complete acquittals of two of these former employees and no complete resolution as to the charges against the other two former employees 
subsequent to the trial  one of these other individuals pleaded guilty to a felony charge and a second pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge 
additional civil and criminal trials could take place in the future 
evidence that is introduced at such trials may result in further scrutiny by governmental authorities and others 
the existence of this heightened scrutiny and these pending investigations could adversely affect investor confidence and cause the trading price for our securities to decline 
we operate in a highly regulated industry  and are therefore exposed to restrictions on our manner of doing business and a variety of claims relating to such regulation 
our operations are subject to extensive federal regulation  including the communications act of  as amended  and fcc regulations thereunder 
we are also subject to the applicable laws and regulations of various states  including regulation by pucs and other state agencies 
federal laws and fcc regulations generally apply to regulated interstate telecommunications including international telecommunications that originate or terminate in the united states  while state regulatory authorities generally have jurisdiction over regulated telecommunications services that are intrastate in nature 
the local competition aspects of the telecommunications act are subject to fcc rulemaking  but the state regulatory authorities play a significant role in implementing those fcc rules 
generally  we must obtain and maintain certificates of authority from regulatory bodies in most states where we offer regulated services and must obtain prior regulatory approval of rates  terms and conditions for our intrastate services  where required 
our businesses are subject to numerous  and often quite detailed  requirements under federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations 
accordingly  we cannot ensure that we are always in compliance with all these requirements at any single point in time 
the agencies responsible for the enforcement of these laws  rules and regulations may initiate inquires or actions based on their own perceptions of our conduct  or based on customer complaints 
regulation of the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly  and the regulatory environment varies substantially from state to state 
all of our operations are also subject to a variety of environmental  safety  health and other governmental regulations 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory  judicial or legislative activities will not have a material adverse effect on our operations  or that domestic or international regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations 
we monitor our compliance with federal  state and local regulations governing the discharge and disposal of hazardous and environmentally sensitive materials  including the emission of electromagnetic radiation 
although we believe that we are in compliance with such regulations  any such discharge  disposal or emission might expose us to claims or actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
risks affecting our liquidity our high debt levels  the restrictive terms of our debt instruments and the substantial litigation pending against us pose risks to our viability and may make us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions  as well as other adverse developments 
we are highly leveraged 
as of december   our consolidated debt was approximately billion 
as shown above in liquidity and capital resources payment obligations and contingencies in item of this report  a considerable amount of our debt obligations come due over the next few years 
while we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet our obligations when they come due  we cannot anticipate what our future condition will be 
we may have unexpected costs and liabilities and we may have limited access to financing 
in addition to our periodic need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due  we may also need to obtain additional financing or investigate other methods to generate cash such as further cost reductions or the sale of non strategic assets if cash provided by operations does not improve  if revenue and cash provided by operations continue to decline  if economic conditions weaken  if competitive pressures increase or if we become subject to significant judgments and or settlements as further discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report and in liquidity and capital resources above 
we have million of availability under the qsc credit facility  but this facility contains various limitations  including a restriction on using any proceeds from the facility to pay settlements or judgments relating to investigations and securities actions discussed in legal proceedings investigations and securities actions in item of this report 
the qsc credit facility also has a cross payment default provision  and the qsc credit facility and certain other debt issues of qcii and its other subsidiaries have cross acceleration provisions 
when present  such provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument 
any such event could adversely affect our ability to conduct business or access the capital markets and could adversely impact our credit ratings 
our high debt level could adversely impact our credit ratings 
additionally  the degree to which we are leveraged may have other important limiting consequences  including the following placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared with our less leveraged competitors  including some who have significantly reduced their debt through a bankruptcy proceeding  making us more vulnerable to the current or future downturns in general economic conditions or in any of our businesses  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes 
we may be unable to significantly reduce the substantial capital requirements or operating expenses necessary to continue to operate our business  which may in turn affect our operating results 
we anticipate that our capital requirements relating to maintaining and routinely upgrading our network will continue to be significant in the coming years 
we may be unable to further significantly reduce our capital requirements or operating expenses even if revenue is decreasing 
we also may be unable to significantly reduce the operating expenses associated with our future contractual cash obligations  including future purchase commitments  which may in turn affect our operating results 
such non discretionary capital outlays and operating expenses may lessen our ability to compete with other providers who face less significant spending requirements 
while we believe that our current level of capital expenditures will meet both our maintenance and our core growth requirements going forward  this may not be the case if circumstances underlying our expectations change 
if we are unable to renegotiate a significant portion of certain future purchase commitments  we may suffer related losses 
as of december   our aggregate future purchase commitments totaled approximately billion 
we entered into these commitments  which obligate us to purchase network services and capacity  hardware or advertising from other vendors  with the expectation that we would use these commitments in association with projected revenues 
in certain cases  as a result of changes in strategy or other factors  we no longer generate the revenue we originally projected to be associated with these commitments 
because we are in a rapidly changing industry  we always face the risk of other contracts becoming similarly underutilized 
if we are unable to restructure or renegotiate our underutilized contracts both existing and future in a profitable manner  we could suffer from substantial ongoing expenses without associated revenue to offset the expenses related to these arrangements 
in addition  we may incur losses in connection with these restructurings and renegotiations 
declines in the value of pension plan assets could require us to provide significant amounts of funding for our pension plan 
while we do not expect to be required to make material cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan in the near term based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts  a significant decline in the value of pension plan assets in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
as a result  we may be required to fund our benefit plans with cash from operations  perhaps by a material amount 
currently  our plan assets exceed our accumulated benefit obligation by million 
recognition of an additional minimum liability caused by changes in plan assets or measurement of the accumulated benefit obligation could have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet 
as an example  if our accumulated benefit obligation exceeded plan assets in the future  the impact would be to eliminate our prepaid pension asset  which is currently billion  record a pension liability for the amount that our accumulated benefit obligation exceeds plan assets with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive loss in stockholder s deficit 
alternatively  we could make a voluntary contribution to the plan so that the plan assets exceed the accumulated benefit obligation 
if we pursue and are involved in any business combinations  our financial condition could be affected 
on a regular and ongoing basis  we review and evaluate other businesses and opportunities for business combinations that would be strategically beneficial 
as a result  we may be involved in negotiations or discussions that  if they were to result in a transaction  could have a material effect on our financial condition including short term or long term liquidity or short term or long term results of operations 
should we make an error in judgment when identifying an acquisition candidate  or should we fail to successfully integrate acquired operations  we will likely fail to realize the benefits we intended to derive from the acquisition and may suffer other adverse consequences 
acquisitions involve a number of other risks  including incurrence of substantial transaction costs  diversion of management s attention from operating our existing business  charges to earnings in the event of any write down or write off of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions  depletion of our cash resources or incurrence of additional indebtedness to fund acquisitions  and assumption of liabilities of an acquired business including unforeseen liabilities 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions 
other risks relating to qwest if conditions or assumptions differ from the judgments  assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies  the accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our critical accounting policies  which are described in this form k  describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements that are considered critical because they require judgments  assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
as a result  if future events differ significantly from the judgments  assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies or different assumptions are used in the future  such events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
taxing authorities may determine we owe additional taxes relating to various matters  which could adversely affect our financial results 
as a significant taxpayer  we are subject to frequent and regular audits from the irs  as well as from state and local tax authorities 
these audits could subject us to risks associated with adverse positions taken by these tax authorities 
please see legal proceedings other matters in item of this report for examples of legal proceedings involving some of these adverse positions 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  qwest received notices of proposed adjustments on several significant issues for the audit cycle 
additionally  the irs indicated in january  that it is reviewing qwest s tax treatment of the dex sale in the audit cycle 
because prior to qwest was a member of affiliated groups filing consolidated us federal income tax returns  we could be severally liable for tax examinations and adjustments not directly applicable to current members of the qwest affiliated group 
tax sharing agreements have been executed between us and previous affiliates  and we believe the liabilities  if any  arising from adjustments to tax liability would be borne by the affiliated group member determined to have a deficiency under the terms and conditions of such agreements and applicable tax law 
we have not provided in our financial statements for any liability of former affiliated members or for claims they have asserted or may assert against us 
while we believe our tax reserves adequately provide for the associated tax contingencies under current accounting literature  qwest s tax audits and examinations may result in tax liabilities that differ materially from those we have recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
also  the ultimate outcomes of all of these matters are uncertain  and we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our financial results  including potentially offsetting a significant portion of our existing net operating losses 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time  or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage  our business and operating results could be materially harmed 
we are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions  which represent a significant number of our employees 
although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory  no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements  if disputes with our unions arise  or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage  we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in august  we reached agreements with the cwa and the ibew on two year labor contracts 
each of these agreements was ratified by union members and expires on august  the impact of future negotiations  including changes in wages and benefit levels that are collectively bargained for as part of the overall contracts with the unions  could have a material impact on our financial results 
as an example  if we are not able to negotiate for certain key contractual terms such as caps on reimbursable post retirement health care costs  we could be required to recognize materially higher employee costs 
the trading price of our securities could be volatile 
in recent years  the capital markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the overall market and the trading price of our securities may fluctuate greatly 
the trading price of our securities may be significantly affected by various factors  including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  changes in investors and analysts perception of the business risks and conditions of our business  broader market fluctuations  and general economic or political conditions
