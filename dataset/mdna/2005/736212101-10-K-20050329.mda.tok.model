year ended december  in thousands external sales intersegment sales operating income average translation rate of british pound sterling to united states dollar sales by product line material handling products sales friction management products and services total product sales includes intersegment sales 
for the year ended december   united kingdom s external sales of million increased by million or  from million during the same period in this increase in external sales is attributable to a favorable foreign currency translation of approximately million  partially offset by a slight sales volume decrease 
this sales volume decrease is primarily due to decreased demand for our friction management products and services  as a result of our largest customer  network rail  undergoing a significant reorganization that began during the latter part of and has carried into the decrease in sales of our friction management products and services was almost entirely offset by an increase in sales of our material handling products resulting from increased customer demand of our overhead and floor conveyor systems 
operating income of  for the year ended december  was consistent with the same period in as the increased sales volume of our material handling product line has somewhat offset the decrease in our higher margin rail sales 
for the year ended december   united kingdom s external sales of million increased by million or  from million in the increase in external sales is primarily due to an incremental increase in total material handling sales of million as a result of the quodeck acquisition and favorable foreign exchange translations of approximately  for material handling sales in british pounds sterling to us dollars

operating income for the year ended december  increased to  from  in  an increase of  or  due primarily to the quodeck acquisition  which increased incremental material handling operating income by approximately  for the year ended december  this increase in operating income was partially offset by increases in rail related administrative expenses in liquidity and capital resources our cash flow from operations is the primary source of financing for internal growth  capital expenditures  and repayments of long term contractual obligations  dividends to our shareholders  and other commercial commitments 
the most significant risk associated with our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations is the overall level of demand for our products 
in addition  we have cash invested in short term government money market funds of million  and cash invested in us treasury bills of million at december  primarily as a result of our initial public offering and subsequent underwritten over allotment exercise 
we believe we can manage our working capital and control costs to meet our cash flow needs for the next twelve months to meet our growth objectives 
in addition to cash generated from operations  we have four primary revolving and overdraft credit facilities in place to support the working capital needs of each of our business segments 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the availability under our credit lines and proceeds from the initial public offering will be sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements over the next twelve months 
cash flow analysis 
for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operations was million  an increase of million  compared to  during the same period 
the primary reasons for this increase is related to timing differences in operating assets and liabilities  along with an increase in net income of approximately  in addition  cash provided by operations in also includes decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets  which were primarily related to legal and accounting costs incurred for the initial public offering of our common stock in january  which resulted in an increase of million in cash provided by operations during  compared to for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operations was  compared to million in cash flow provided by operations in the primary reasons for this decrease in are due to increases in inventory levels  accounts receivable balances and prepaid expenses related to our pending initial public offering 
inventory levels at our canadian operation near montreal increased by million during  as inventory levels were artificially low due to a work stoppage at our primary steel supplier at the end of also  inventory levels at rmp increased by  during to meet customer demands during the fourth quarter of accounts receivable increased by  during due primarily to the increased sales volume at rmp 
also  increased prepaid expenses and other assets of million negatively impacted cash provided from operations as these costs were primarily related to costs incurred for our pending initial public offering 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to  of cash used in investing activities during we used approximately million for business acquisitions in in addition  our capital expenditures for  and approximated million   and  respectively  and were primarily to support new strategic initiatives  develop new products  and upgrade machinery and equipment  almost all of which was discretionary 
we believe the overall level of capital spending for our business segments is sufficient to remain competitive 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to cash used in financing activities of million in during  cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of approximately million and net proceeds from bank term debt of million for the purchase of of the outstanding common and preferred stock of kelsan 
these sources of cash were partially offset by net repayments on revolving and overdraft credit facilities of million  repayments of long term debt and capital lease obligations in the amount of million and cash dividends paid of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for compared to million in cash used in financing activities during is related to the net repayments and borrowings of long term obligations in the amount of million and cash dividends paid of  these uses of cash were offset by increased borrowings of million on our revolving credit facilities  which were used to support working capital needs due to the increased demand for our products  as well as costs incurred in conjunction with our pending initial public offering of common stock

financial condition at december   total assets were million  an increase of million or from december  this increase in total assets at december  is primarily due to the tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill  of approximately million added as a result of the salient systems and kelsan acquisitions during at december   net working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities was million  an increase of million or  from million at december  cash and cash equivalents have increased approximately million at december  from december   primarily as a result of our initial public offering of common stock in january inventory levels have increased million at december  from december   primarily to meet customer demand 
in addition  at december   inventory levels at salient systems and kelsan were  and million  respectively 
accounts receivable balances have increased by approximately million from december   primarily resulting from the acquisitions of salient systems and kelsan during  as well as increased sales volumes at our other operating business units during the fourth quarter 
total outstanding debt obligations at december  increased by approximately million or  to million as of december   from million at december  the primary reasons for the increase in debt obligations at december  are due to the kelsan and salient systems acquisitions during outstanding borrowings related to the financing of these acquisitions amounted to million as of december  offsetting this increase in debt obligations were net term loan  revolving credit and overdraft credit facility repayments totaling approximately million during  most of which was repaid with proceeds from our initial public stock offering in january as discussed in item legal proceedings  portec  inc  our predecessor  was named with other defendants in an environmental lawsuit 
niagara mohawk  as plaintiff  seeks to recover costs that it has incurred to investigate and remediate its own property as required by the new york state department of environmental conservation nysdec 
we have not been named as a liable party by the nysdec and believe we have no liability to the plaintiff in the case 
we believe that niagara mohawk s case against portec  inc is without merit and  therefore  if niagara mohawk prevails on appeal we intend to vigorously defend against niagara mohawk s claims 
because niagara mohawk is seeking unspecified monetary contribution from the defendants  we are unable to determine  if niagara mohawk were to prevail on appeal  the extent to which we would have to make contribution  or whether such contribution would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  total clean up costs at the troy water street site are expected to be substantial and may approach million 
if liability for a portion of these costs is attributed to us  such liability could be material 
furthermore  if niagara mohawk wins on appeal  ongoing litigation may be protracted  and legal expenses may be material to our results of operations 
we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covers substantially all united states employees and our retirees 
benefits under the plan were based on years of service for hourly employees 
for salaried employees  benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee s average compensation during defined periods of service 
in august  we amended our united states defined benefit plan by freezing the benefits accrued for all participants effective december  and preventing new enrollments after december  our future net periodic pension cost and plan funding will be dependent upon the performance of plan assets 
in addition  we also maintain a contributory defined benefit plan in the united kingdom 
the plan covers some of our active employees  former employees and our retirees and has been frozen to new entrants since april  benefits under the plan were based on years of service and eligible compensation during defined periods of service 
the estimated cash flow funding for the next five years is expected to range from  to  per year 
in accordance with united kingdom pension regulations  employee cash contributions to the plan were terminated on december  the products we manufacture and sell  such as our joint bars  rail anchors and rail spikes  require steel as a major element in the production process 
throughout  worldwide steel prices have spiked upwards resulting in surcharges being added to our overall raw material costs 
as a result  these steel surcharges increased our raw material costs 
while these higher material costs have had some negative impact on our financial results over the last half of and during the first two months of  particularly on our rail anchor and rail spike product lines and our track component product lines  we believe the impact of the higher material costs have not had a material impact on our overall financial results 
although we have been successful in passing through most of the steel surcharges on to our customers  we have been able to do so at no added gross margin 
if a prolonged increase in steel prices should continue and we are unable to pass on these added costs to our customers  our future earnings could be negatively impacted 
discussion of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are delivered and title has passed or when service is performed 
delivery is determined by our shipping terms  which are primarily fob shipping point 
shipments are made only under a valid contract or purchase order where the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized net of returns  discounts and other allowances 
revenue from installation of material handling equipment  and railway wayside data collection and data management systems is generally recognized by applying percentages of completion for each contract to the total estimated profits for the respective contracts 
the length of each contract varies  but is typically about two to five months 
the percentages of completion are determined by relating the actual costs of work performed to date  to the current estimated total costs of the respective contracts 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  repairs and depreciation costs 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  the entire loss is immediately recorded in the accounting period that the loss is determined 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimates of total costs or revenue during the course of the work is reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that caused the revision first become known 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain a reserve to absorb probable losses relating to bad debts arising from uncollectible accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that we consider adequate to absorb probable bad debts inherent in the accounts receivable balance and is based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of the collectability  historical loss experience of accounts receivable and the financial status of customers with accounts receivable balances 
bad debts are charged and recoveries are credited to the reserve when incurred 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because we have a significant concentration of accounts receivable in the rail industry 
the economic conditions could affect our customers ability to pay and changes in the estimate could have a material effect on net income 
inventories 
we establish obsolescence reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
obsolescence reserves reduce the carrying value of slow moving and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value  which generally approximates the recoverable scrap value 
we utilize historical usage  our experience  current backlog and forecasted usage to evaluate our reserve amounts 
we also periodically evaluate our inventory carrying value to ensure that the amounts are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory reserves may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the goodwill of each of our reporting units for impairment as required under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss  if any 
goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require our judgment 
factors that could change the result of our goodwill impairment test include  but are not limited to  different assumptions used to forecast future revenue  expenses  capital expenditures and working capital requirements used in our cash flow models 
in addition  selection of a risk adjusted discount rate on the estimated undiscounted cash flow is susceptible to future changes in market conditions and when unfavorable  can adversely affect our original estimates of fair values 
since adoption of sfas  we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill 
as part of the acquisitions of salient systems and kelsan  we recorded the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the companies in accordance with sfas no 
as part of our procedures to assign fair values to all acquired assets  we hired an independent appraiser to evaluate the technology and intellectual property along with any other intangible assets that we could assign a fair value to under both of these acquisitions 
we supplied the independent appraiser with the historical and estimated cash flows of the companies along with an estimate of future costs to maintain these technologies 
the independent appraiser used these estimates and other assumptions to determine the present value of the discounted cash flows of these various technologies 
in addition  we evaluated the future lives of the identified intangible assets to determine if they have definite or indefinite lives 
as a result of the salient systems acquisition  we assigned a fair value to their wheel impact load detector and rail stress monitor in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
we also determined that there was million of goodwill to be recorded as part of this transaction 
in addition  we determined that the intangible assets under the salient systems acquisition had indefinite lives due to our plans to make continual enhancements to the technology and related products  such that some generation of this technology could be in use for as long as railroads operate 
in the future  we will monitor these intangible assets to determine if certain events occur that would cause the lives to become definite and thereby assign a future estimated life based on the years that we feel that the product would have value in the marketplace and then record an impairment charge in the proper accounting period 
as a result of the kelsan acquisition  we assigned a fair value to their stick friction modifier product line and the keltrack liquid friction modifier product line in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
we also determined that there was million of goodwill to be recorded as part of this transaction 
in addition  we have estimated that the stick friction modifier product technology and keltrack liquid friction modifier product technology have definite lives of years and years due to our estimates that the projected economic earnings associated with these technology based product lines will begin to lapse after these time frames 
in the future  we will monitor these assets to determine if certain events occur that would cause the lives assigned to these intangible assets to become shorter than originally assigned  and thereby  we would assign a shorter future estimated life based on the years that we feel that the product would have value in the marketplace and record an impairment charge in the proper accounting period 
defined benefit pension plans 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for certain of our employees and retirees 
we account for these plans as required under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the liabilities and expenses for pensions require significant judgments and estimates 
these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  inflation  the long term rate of return on plan assets and mortality tables 
management has mitigated the future liability for active employees by freezing all defined benefit pension plans effective december  the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bonds that could be used to settle obligations of the plan 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the long term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations 
the effects of actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligations in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our obligations and future expense 
as interest rates decline  the actuarially calculated pension plan liability increases 
conversely  as interest rates increase  the actuarially calculated pension liability decreases 
past declines in interest rates and equity markets have had a negative impact on the pension plan liability and fair value of our plan assets 
as a result  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets at december   and  which resulted in a   and million  net of tax  respectively  charge to other comprehensive loss 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any necessary valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as a company with international operations  we record an estimated liability or benefit for our current income tax provision and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we use our best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount 
we do not believe that such a charge would be material 
the process of recording deferred tax assets and liabilities involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
if a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense is recorded 
the valuation allowance is based on our experience  current economic situation and budgets 
we believe that operations will provide taxable income levels to recover the deferred tax assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our contractual long term debt obligations and our working capital facilities are under floating interest rate arrangements 
however  we have determined that these risks are not significant enough to warrant hedging programs 
if interest rates increase  we will be exposed to higher interest rates and we will be required to use more cash to settle our long term debt obligations 
as interest rates increase on our variable long term debt  it will have a negative impact on future earnings because the increased rates will increase our interest expense 
conversely  if interest rates decrease on our variable long term debt  it will have a positive impact on future earnings because the lower rates will decrease our interest expense 
based upon the long term debt amount as of december   for every increase or decrease in the interest rate on our long term debt  our annual interest expense will fluctuate by approximately  in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency translation fluctuations with our two international operations 
we do not have any foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures 
therefore  we are exposed to the related effects when the foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate 
if the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar and or the british pound sterling  the translation rate for these foreign currencies will decrease  which will have a negative impact on our operating income 
for example  for year ended december   for every change in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar  our canadian operation s operating income would have changed by approximately  further  for every change in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling to the us dollar  the impact on operating income for our united kingdom operations for the year ended december  would have been approximately  foreign currency translation fluctuations have no impact on cash flows as long as we continue to reinvest any profits back into the respective foreign operations
