item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted therapies for cancer 
our portfolio of product candidates includes active immunotherapies  monoclonal antibodies and small molecules to treat a wide range of cancers 
the product candidates most advanced in development are active immunotherapies designed to stimulate a patient s immune system for the treatment of cancer 
our most advanced product candidate is provenge  an active immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  contract manufacturing expenses  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and marketing expenses 
we anticipate incurring net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our technology  expand our operations and develop the infrastructure to support the commercialization of provenge 
we anticipate that we will not generate revenue from the sale of our commercial therapeutic products for the next two years 
without revenue generated from commercial sales  we anticipate that we will continue to fund our ongoing research  development and general operations from our available cash resources  and with revenue  including license fees and milestone payments  received from our current or future collaborators 
the timing and level of funding from our existing or future collaborations will fluctuate based upon the success of our research programs  our ability to meet milestones and receipt of approvals from government regulators 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as a result of increased research and clinical trial activity 
clinical trial costs may grow at a faster rate compared to research and other preclinical expenses as we continue our ongoing  phase clinical trial of provenge  db  and advance other potential products in clinical development 
our first phase clinical trial for provenge  d  was a double blind placebo controlled clinical trial in men with metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer 
the trial was designed to measure a delay in time to disease progression 
time to the onset of disease related pain was a secondary endpoint that was to be evaluated in concert with the results from a second  identical companion trial  d patients were given the option to receive salvage therapy on a separate open label study 
both protocols required patients to be followed for survival for three years after enrollment 
trial d approached  but did not meet its main objective of showing a statistically significant delay in the median time to disease progression in the overall patient population in the study 
the trial results did  however  identify a group of patients  those with tumors that had been classified as gleason score or less  who appeared to benefit most significantly by treatment with provenge compared to patients who received placebo 
in these men  provenge appeared to delay disease progression 
our second phase trial  d  was still underway when the d results on progression were obtained and the survival follow up was still ongoing 
based on discussions with the food and drug administration fda  we amended d to contain two parts d part a da includes those patients enrolled regardless of gleason score  and part b db restricts enrollment to those patients most like the group of patients that appeared to benefit in d  those with gleason scores of or less 
trial db has received a positive special protocol assessment from the fda 
more recently  we completed the planned three year follow up for survival on the d patients and disclosed that a significant survival advantage was seen in those patients who had been assigned to the provenge arm compared to those who had been assigned to receive placebo 
this survival benefit is greater than that 
table of contents observed with any type of treatment in any published phase study in late stage prostate cancer 
in addition  at the month final follow up  the percentage of patients alive in the provenge treated group is substantially greater than the percentage of patients who received placebo 
final results from trial da also did not achieve statistical significance for delaying the time to disease progression 
a preliminary analysis of overall survival in the da clinical trial indicated that both the survival rates and the median survival benefit compared to placebo show trends that are similar to the results observed in the final three year survival analysis of the d study 
we plan to complete the final pre specified  three year survival analysis of the da study in the second half of provenge has fast track designation from the fda for the treatment of men with gleason score or less with asymptomatic  metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer 
we are currently conducting a pivotal phase clinical trial of provenge  db  in this indication 
we are also completing a double blind placebo controlled trial p in androgen dependent prostate cancer 
we own commercialization rights for provenge worldwide 
if the final pre specified three year survival analysis of da is supportive to the data from d  we would anticipate submitting a biologics license application in based on the results from d and da  we may amend the current db protocol to enroll men regardless of their gleason score 
if db is amended and is required for regulatory approval and is successful in meeting its specified endpoints  we would submit a biologics license application after neuvenge apc over the last several years  we conducted phase clinical trials for neuvenge  our investigational immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with breast  ovarian and other solid tumors expressing her neu 
in december  we announced results from two phase studies of neuvenge indicating that neuvenge stimulated an immune response and may provide clinical benefit in patients with advanced  metastatic her neu positive breast cancer 
the data indicates that neuvenge stimulates a robust immune response and is well tolerated 
we are presently designing phase trials of neuvenge in women with metastatic breast cancer 
preclinical research and development programs in addition to other active immunotherapies in preclinical research and development  we have monoclonal antibody and small molecule product candidates in preclinical research and development programs 
these include product candidates being developed with our collaborators 
our collaboration with genentech  inc targets the development of product candidates directed against trp p  a cancer specific ion channel 
we are currently engaged in discovering  evaluating and developing monoclonal antibodies and small molecule therapeutics that modify trp p function 
our collaboration with abgenix  inc is focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of fully human monoclonal antibodies against a membrane bound serine protease 
under the terms of the collaboration  abgenix will use its human antibody technologies to generate and select antibodies against this serine protease 
both companies will have the right to co develop and commercialize  or  if co development is not elected  to solely develop and commercialize  any antibody product candidates discovered during the collaboration 
the companies will share equally in the product development costs and any profits from sales of products successfully commercialized from co development efforts 
we also are collaborating with dyax corp 
to discover  develop and commercialize monoclonal antibody  small protein and peptide inhibitors for two endotheliase enzymes 
under the terms of this agreement  both 
table of contents companies will jointly develop any product candidates that may be identified and will share commercialization rights and will share profits  if any  from any marketed products 
we have a monoclonal antibody program that targets hla dr and the use of antibodies directed to this target to kill cancer cells 
corvas acquisition in july  we acquired corvas international  inc for approximately million through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
this acquisition expanded our product pipeline and strengthened our balance sheet 
to efficiently manage the ongoing programs located in corvas s san diego operations  we relocated essential san diego activities to our headquarters in seattle and completed the closure of the san diego facility in june critical accounting policies and estimates cash  cash equivalents  and investments we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
the amounts are recorded at cost  which approximate fair market value 
our cash equivalents  short and long term investments consist principally of commercial paper  money market securities  corporate bonds notes and certificates of deposit 
we have classified our entire investment portfolio as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amortized cost of investments is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization and accretion are included in interest income 
interest earned on securities is included in interest income 
gains are recognized when realized in our consolidated statements of operations 
losses are recognized when we have determined that an other than temporary decline in fair value has occurred 
we consider an investment with a maturity greater than twelve months as long term and a maturity less than twelve months as short term 
revenue recognition substantially all of the revenue we receive is collaborative research revenue and license revenue 
we recognize collaborative research revenues from up front payments  milestone payments  and personnel supported research funding 
we recognize license revenue from intellectual technology agreements 
the payments received under these research collaboration agreements are contractually not refundable even if the research effort is not successful 
performance under our collaborative agreements is measured by scientific progress  as mutually agreed upon by us and our collaborators 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is an objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
up front payments up front payments from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
when the research term is not specified in the agreement and instead the agreement specifies the completion or attainment of a particular development goal  an estimate is made of the time required to achieve that goal considering experience with similar 
table of contents projects  level of effort and the development stage of the project 
the basis of the revenue recognition is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
milestones payments for milestones that are based on the achievement of substantive and at risk performance criteria are recognized in full at such time as the specified milestone has been achieved according to the terms of the agreement 
when payments are not for substantive and at risk milestones  revenue is recognized as if the payment was an up front fee 
personnel supported research funding under these agreements  research and development activities are performed by designated full time equivalent personnel fte during a specified funding period 
the fte funding rate is an agreed upon rate comparable to other rates for similar research and development services 
payments received in advance of the research and development activities performed are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the related funding period 
our performance is on a best efforts basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success 
license fees non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  collectability is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
product sales revenue from product supply agreements is recorded when the product is shipped  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  amounts are deemed to be collectible and all other obligations under the agreements are met 
grant revenue revenue related to grant agreements is recognized as related research and development expenses are incurred 
royalty income royalties from licensees are based on reported sales of licensed products and revenues are calculated based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
research and development expenses pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for research and development costs  our research and development costs are expensed as incurred or at the date payment of non refundable upfront fees and milestones become due  whichever occurs first 
the value of acquired ipr d is charged to expense on the date of acquisition 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expenses  lab expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  facilities and overhead costs 
reclassification of operating expenses we periodically review and refine the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead cost to operating expense categories 
certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation  including certain corporate overhead costs aggregating approximately million and million previously reported as general and administrative expenses that have been reclassified to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
items reclassified include certain costs related to human resources  facilities and information technology 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb recently enacted statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r  share based payment which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  
table of contents using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for fiscal through fiscal  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net loss per share 
in december  the fasb issued fas  exchange of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for nonmonetary transactions is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this amendment of apb eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairments and its application to certain investments which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we will evaluate the impact of eitf once final guidance is issued 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
revenue was million in  million in and million in the decrease was primarily due to the termination of our collaboration with kirin brewery co  ltd 
in november  partially offset by revenue recognized of million in connection with our license agreement with nuvelo  inc for our novel recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c rnapc and all other rnapc proteins 
the increase compared with was primarily due to increased kirin license and milestone revenue recognized as a result of our agreement with kirin entered into in november partially offset by a decrease in revenue related to the expiration of our collaboration with the johnson johnson pharmaceutical research and development  llc  or j j prd 
during the years ended december  and we recognized kirin fte revenue of million and million  respectively 
in  we expect lower collaborative and license revenue due to the end of our collaborations with kirin and j j prd 
in november  we licensed to kirin worldwide patent rights relating to the use of certain hla dr antibodies being developed by kirin for which kirin agreed to pay us million and released its rights to our active immunotherapy product candidates including our lead product candidate  provenge  in asia and pacific rim countries 
this agreement ended our collaboration with kirin 
the million is to be paid to us in cash in four installments  of which million was paid in december  million was paid in november and million is to be paid annually for two years thereafter 
we recognized revenue in the fourth quarter of of million related to this agreement  representing proceeds received and to be received  net of a discount of for interest 

table of contents in august  we entered into an agreement with genentech  inc to collaborate in the preclinical research  clinical development  and commercialization of monoclonal antibody and potentially other products derived from our trp p gene platform 
we are jointly responsible with genentech for conducting preclinical and clinical work 
genentech will fund a majority of these expenses for products that reach phase clinical trials 
genentech will also be responsible for all manufacturing of resulting products 
the agreement provides for profit sharing and commercialization in the united states 
we received a non refundable up front fee of million upon signing the agreement 
this payment has been deferred and is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated research term 
genentech will make other option and milestone payments to us upon achievement of product development goals 
during the years ended december   and we recognized revenue of   and  respectively  related to this agreement 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase compared with was primarily due to contract manufacturing to support the db clinical trial and to prepare for commercial level production runs  personnel related costs  clinical expense due to increased patients and other costs associated with the db clinical trial  consulting fees related to the commercialization of provenge  contract research fees and the impairment and subsequent write off of fixed assets acquired from corvas 
the increase compared with was primarily due to increased contract manufacturing and clinical trial expenses as well as increased personnel related costs and facilities expense due to the integration of corvas into our operations 
financial data from our research and development related activities is compiled and managed by us as follows clinical programs  and discovery research 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions clinical programs cancer cardiovascular from our acquisition of corvas indirect costs total clinical programs discovery research total research and development expense direct research and development costs associated with our clinical programs include clinical trial site costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs incurred for consultants and other outside services  such as data management and statistical analysis support  and materials and supplies used in support of the clinical programs 
indirect costs of our clinical program include wages  payroll taxes  and other employee related expenses including rent  utilities and other facilities related maintenance 
the costs in each category may change in the future and new categories may be added 
costs attributable to our discovery research programs represent our efforts to develop and expand our product pipeline 
due to the number of projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects  our discovery research program costs are not assigned to specific projects 
the aggregate costs of our research and development collaborative agreements include discovery research and clinical efforts where drug technology is developed across our active immunotherapy  monoclonal antibody and small molecule technology platforms 
our collaborative partners enjoy the benefit from the discoveries and knowledge generated across these platforms 
the majority of our collaborative agreements involve an exchange 
table of contents of potential rights in the territories and indications or field of science  as defined in the respective agreements  in exchange for cash payments 
our collaborative agreements track deliverables based on measures around scientific progress to which we and our partners agree on a periodic basis  primarily quarterly 
while we believe our clinical programs are promising  we do not know whether any commercially viable products will result from our research and development efforts 
due to the unpredictable nature of scientific research and product development  we cannot reasonably estimate the timeframe over which our projects are likely to be completed  whether they will be completed  if they are completed  whether they will provide therapeutic benefit or be approved for sale by the necessary government agencies  or whether  if approved  they will be scalable to meet commercial demand 
we anticipate that we will not generate revenue from the sale of our commercial therapeutic products for the next two years 
without revenue generated from commercial sales  we anticipate that we will continue to fund our ongoing research  development and general operations with revenue received from collaborations  milestone payments and license fees from our current or future collaborators and our available cash resources 
the timing and level of funding from our existing or future collaborations will fluctuate based upon the success of our research programs  our ability to meet milestones and receipts of approvals from government regulators 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as a result of increased contract manufacturing of antigen scale up and clinical trial activity 
on october   we entered into a second amendment to our bioprocessing services agreement originally dated march  with diosynth rtp  inc pursuant to this agreement  diosynth has undertaken to produce antigen used in provenge  our investigational therapeutic active immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer  at commercial manufacturing levels to support a bla filing 
pursuant to the second amendment  diosynth will perform studies to verify the manufacturing process for the antigen and will manufacture the antigen at commercial scale to validate the manufacturing process 
the total contract price payable by us for this work is million 
if we terminate the agreement without cause  or if diosynth were to terminate in the event of our default  we would be obligated to pay diosynth a cancellation fee equal to a portion of the remaining uninvoiced contract amount  which would not exceed million as of december  in addition  we are obligated under the amended agreement to pay fees in the event of delays in our required performance 
on october   we issued  shares of our common stock  priced at per share  the average closing price of our stock over the trading days preceding the amendment  in satisfaction of our initial million payment obligation 
for accounting purposes  these shares were valued based on the fair market value of at issuance date  resulting in a charge of million 
the stock was registered under our existing shelf registration statement and the stock may be resold by diosynth without restriction 
acquired in process research and development 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred an expense of million associated with the write off of the acquired in process research and development ipr d related to the corvas acquisition 
the million of ipr d represents the purchase price allocation to ipr d based on an estimate of the fair value of in process technology for projects of corvas that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  from million in  and million in the increase in compared with was primarily due to costs associated with the closure of our san diego facility of approximately million  increased patent legal fees due to an increase in the patent portfolio as a result of the corvas acquisition  increased consulting and audit fees to comply with the sarbanes oxley act  personnel costs  non cash board compensation expenses of  consulting fees and a retirement agreement with a former chairman resulting in cash compensation of  and non cash compensation of  the increase in 
table of contents compared with was primarily due to increased personnel  legal  consulting and administrative expenses  partially due to the integration of corvas into our operations 
we currently anticipate general and administrative spending to increase over levels due to increased personnel to support the provenge b clinical trial and commercialization efforts 
marketing 
marketing expenses increased to million in from  in and  in the increase compared to was primarily due to increased personnel related costs  advertising related to the recruiting effort for the db clinical trial  market research  medical education  and corporate branding 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower medical and market research spending  and a reduction in personnel 
marketing expenses are expected to be higher in  as we develop marketing strategies related to provenge 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents  and short and long term investments  as well as an increase in interest income related to an outstanding receivable balance 
the decrease in compared to was due to the decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance 
interest income is expected to be lower in than in due to a declining cash balance 
interest expense 
interest expense was  in compared to  in and  in the decrease compared with was primarily due to lower average capital lease balances 
the increase compared with was primarily due to interest expense of  related to debt of million acquired as part of our acquisition of corvas 
in september the debt was paid in cash and the accreted interest was paid in stock 
we expect interest expense to increase in the future as a result of additional financing of capital purchases 
foreign tax benefit expense 
during the year ended december   we reversed our deferred foreign income tax liability and recognized a tax benefit of million based on a new tax treaty entered into between the united states and japan on march  the new treaty eliminated withholding taxes on all royalties  certain interest income and other inter company dividends 
foreign income tax expense was million in  of which was reversed in  compared with  in the amounts in and related to japanese withholding tax on certain payments received and due to be received from kirin 
income taxes as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
included in net operating loss carryforwards is approximately million relating to stock based compensation tax deductions  a portion of which  when realized  will be allocated directly to contributed capital 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits carryforwards before utilization 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense consists of the amortization of deferred stock based compensation resulting from the grant of stock options at exercise prices subsequently deemed to be less than the fair value of the common stock on the grant date and the issuance of stock options to non employees in exchange for services and to stock option modifications 
in  we extended the post termination period of certain options granted to a former member of the board of directors and recorded stock based compensation of  using the intrinsic value method 
in we recorded deferred stock based compensation of  related to restricted 
table of contents stock awards granted to dendreon employees that vest after one year and the balance over the remaining three year vesting period 
the company granted stock purchase rights to employees hired after august   including those involved in the corvas acquisition  during and that were not qualified under the plan 
we recognized stock based compensation charges of million  including  of related payroll taxes  when the rights were exercised in in we recorded deferred stock based compensation of  related to restricted stock awards granted to members of our management team that vest upon grant and the balance over a two year period 
we recorded these amounts as a component of stockholders equity and are amortizing them by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using the accelerated method 
in we recorded deferred stock based compensation of  related to the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed in the corvas merger 
in  we reversed deferred stock based compensation of  related to forfeitures resulting from the closure of our san diego facility 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million in   in and  in we recorded stock based consulting expense of zero   and  in  and  respectively  related to grants to non employees 
we are currently evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption of the standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations and net loss per share 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments were million at december  we have financed our operations to date primarily through proceeds from the sale of our equity securities  cash receipts from collaboration arrangements  interest income earned  equipment lease financings and loan facilities 
in connection with the july  acquisition of corvas we acquired million of cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
we have received net proceeds of million from the sale of our equity securities since january   of which million resulted from our january follow on offering 
to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures in all periods were a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  contract manufacturing costs  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and marketing expenses 
in  and  these expenditures were partially offset by cash received from our corporate collaborators including license fees from nuvelo of  in and kirin of million and million in and  respectively  research and development expense reimbursements from kirin and j j prd and license fees from genentech 
we expect net cash used in operating activities to increase in the future as a result of increased clinical trial and clinical manufacturing activity  and the ongoing development of a commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of provenge 
since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short and long term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
at december   our aggregate investment in equipment and leasehold improvements was million 
we have an agreement with transamerica  a financing company acquired by ge life sciences and technology financings  under which we have fully financed purchases of million of leasehold improvements  laboratory  computer and office equipment 
the terms are from to months and bear interest at rates ranging from to per year  and we have granted a security interest in all our assets to transamerica 
in january  we entered into a million lease line with ge life sciences and technology financings 
as of december   we had financed  of leasehold improvements  laboratory  computer and office equipment under the ge lease line 
the lease terms are months and bear interest at rates ranging from to per year 
the undrawn balance under this lease line expired on june  in november  we entered into a million lease line with ge life sciences and technology financings 
in october  we increased the amount of this lease line with ge to million 
as of december   we had financed million of laboratory  computer and office 
table of contents equipment under this ge lease line 
the lease term is months and bears interest at to per year 
the undrawn balance under this agreement expired on december  we had a tenant improvement allowance of million from the lessor of our primary seattle  washington facility 
as of december   we had committed all of the allowance for laboratory and manufacturing space at this facility 
the improvement allowance bears interest at the rate of per year and is repaid monthly over the length of the original lease 
we have a tenant improvement allowance of  from selig real estate holdings for the additional office space we recently leased in seattle  washington 
as of december   we had committed all of the allowance for leasehold improvements at our newly leased office space 
in  we plan to continue to fund our capital equipment and leasehold improvements through financing facilities 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to sell up to million of our common stock from time to time 
the sec declared this registration statement sec file no 
effective on january  in june  we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million or million net of offering costs 
on october   we and diosynth rtp  inc entered into an amendment to our bioprocessing services agreement dated march   as amended  under which diosynth purchased  shares of our common stock registered under this registration statement  priced at per share  the average closing price of our stock over the trading days preceding the amendment 
the total purchase price was million 
for accounting purposes  we valued these shares based on the fair market value of on issuance date resulting a charge of million to research and development expense 
as of december   million of common stock can be sold under this registration statement 
under this registration statement  we may sell our common stock directly to purchasers  to or through underwriters or dealers  through agents  or through a combination of such methods 
pursuant to other registration statements  in january  we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million or million  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
in june  we entered into a million equity line financing agreement  or equity line facility  with bny capital markets  inc  or cmi  a registered broker dealer  providing for the potential future issuance by us to cmi of shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had issued a total of  shares at an average price of under the equity line facility for gross proceeds of  less a total fee of  that included fees paid to shoreline pacific in the amount of of the gross proceeds  a one time administration fee to cmi  and other legal and accounting fees 
the equity line facility expired on june  upon expiration of this facility  we paid cmi an additional fee of  which was recorded as general and administrative expense in the year ended december  in the event that we offer our stock directly to purchasers or to purchasers through agents  the shares may be sold at a single closing and a single price  or at multiple closings and at multiple prices 
we expect that the price of process for any such shares sold in such circumstances will reflect our negotiations with prospective investors  the market price of our common stock  recent trends in the market price of our common stock  other factors considered material by the prospective investors and  if applicable  consultation with any agent involved with the sale or sales 
in july  our wholly owned subsidiary  dendreon san diego llc  acquired corvas 
as a result  corvas convertible senior subordinated promissory notes due in the notes became the obligation of dendreon san diego llc  and artisan equity ltd  the holder of the notes  exercised its right to cause the notes to be redeemed pursuant to a change in control provision in the notes 
in accordance with the redemption terms of the notes  we paid the principal of the notes to artisan in cash on september   and elected to pay accreted interest of approximately million on the notes in shares of our common stock 
artisan agreed to accept payment of the accreted interest in shares of our common stock in lieu of cash  provided that  among other things  the resale of the common stock issued in payment of the accreted interest 
table of contents was registered under the securities act 
on october   we filed a registration statement on form s to register the resale of  shares of our common stock by artisan to satisfy the terms of the note permitting payment in shares of our common stock 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on october   and  shares of our common stock were issued to artisan in full payment of the accreted interest 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt and lease obligations  including interest and unconditional purchase obligations in thousands contractual commitments total less than year years years thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations a other contractual commitments a a refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to purchase obligations and other contractual commitments 
as of december   we anticipate that our cash on hand  including our cash equivalents  short and long term investments  and cash generated from our collaboration arrangements will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months  including  among other things supporting our pivotal phase trial of provenge  manufacturing scale up and infrastructure development related to the commercialization of provenge  preparation of an fda application for approval of provenge  and continuing internal research and development 
however  we may need additional financing prior to that time 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds through sales of our common stock under the shelf registration statement  should we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs and some of our clinical trials 
factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition we have a history of operating losses 
we expect to continue to incur losses  and we may never become profitable 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we do not have any products that generate material revenue from product sales or royalties 
operating losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development programs  clinical trials  contract manufacturing  general and administrative expenses in support of operations and marketing expenses 
we do not expect to achieve significant product sales or royalty revenue for two years or more  and we may never do so 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next several years  and these losses may increase significantly as we continue preclinical research and clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our product candidates  expand our operations and develop the infrastructure to support commercialization of provenge and our other potential products 
these losses  among other things  have caused and may continue to cause  our stockholders equity and working capital to decrease 
we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing any of our product candidates  and our operations may not be profitable even if any of our product candidates are commercialized 

table of contents our nearer term prospects are highly dependent on provenge  our lead product candidate 
if we do not successfully submit a biologics license application on provenge with the fda  the fda fails to approve provenge for commercialization or  if approved by the fda  we fail to successfully commercialize provenge  our business would be harmed and our stock price would likely fall 
our most advanced product candidate is provenge  an active immunotherapy for prostate cancer 
provenge has been and is currently being tested in several phase clinical trials 
fda approval of provenge depends on  among other things  our successfully completing a biologics license application based on the data from our phase clinical trials with results that meet fda requirements for approval 
we might fail to complete or experience material delays in completing this application 
in addition  the results from our phase trials and our other clinical trials of provenge might not be sufficient to support approval by the fda of provenge or we may not be successful in meeting manufacturing or other requirements for approval of provenge by the fda 
although we are in discussions with the fda about the final three year survival analysis from d  those discussions may not improve our prospects for obtaining fda approval for provenge or change current projections for when we may obtain such approval 
even if we receive fda approval  we might not be successful in commercializing provenge 
if any of these things occur  our business would be harmed and the price of our common stock would likely fall 
if we fail to enter into collaboration agreements for our product candidates  if they are needed  we may be unable to commercialize them effectively or at all 
to successfully commercialize provenge  our potential product most advanced in development  we will need substantial financial resources and we will need to develop or access expertise and physical resources and systems  including manufacturing facilities  a distribution network  an information technology platform and sales and marketing and other resources that we currently do not have 
we may elect to develop some or all of these physical resources and systems and expertise ourselves or we may seek to collaborate with another biotechnology or pharmaceutical company that will provide some or all of such physical resources and systems as well as financial resources and expertise 
collaborators may be able to provide us with financial and physical resources  systems and expertise for the commercialization of provenge 
such collaborations are complex and any potential discussions may not result in a definitive agreement for many reasons 
for example  whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend  among other things  upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise  the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration  and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number of factors 
those factors may include the design or results of our provenge clinical trials  the potential market for provenge  the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering provenge to patients  the potential of competing products  and industry and market conditions generally 
if we were to determine that a collaboration for provenge is necessary and were unable to enter into such a collaboration on acceptable terms  we might elect to delay or scale back the commercialization of provenge in order to preserve our financial resources or to allow us adequate time to develop the required physical resources  and systems and expertise ourselves 
if we enter into a collaboration agreement we consider acceptable  the collaboration may not proceed as quickly  smoothly or successfully as we plan 
the risks in a collaboration agreement for provenge include the following the collaborator may not apply the expected financial resources or required expertise in developing the physical resources and systems or other systems necessary to successfully commercialize provenge  the collaborator may not invest in the development of a sales and marketing force and the related infrastructure at levels that ensure that sales of provenge reach their full potential  disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that delay the commercialization of provenge or adversely affect its sales or profitability  or 
table of contents the collaborator may independently develop  or develop with third parties  products that could compete with provenge 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect the commercialization of provenge and harm our business and stock price by delaying the date on which sales of the product may begin if it is approved by the fda  by slowing the pace of growth of such sales  by reducing the profitability of the product or by adversely affecting the reputation of the product in the market 
in addition  a collaborator for provenge may have the right to terminate the collaboration at its discretion 
any termination may require us to seek a new collaborator  which we may not be able to do on a timely basis  if at all  or require us to delay or scale back the commercialization efforts 
we may choose to enter into collaboration agreements for one or more of our other product candidates 
with respect to a collaboration for provenge or any of our other product candidates  we are dependent on the success of our collaborators in performing their respective responsibilities and the continued cooperation of our collaborators 
our collaborators may not cooperate with us to perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
we cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators resources that will be devoted to activities related to our collaborative agreements with them 
our collaborators may choose to pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
disputes may arise between us and our collaborators that delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
problems with our collaborators  such as those mentioned above  could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 
we have a collaboration with genentech for the research  development and commercialization of potential therapies targeting trp p we also have collaborations with abgenix for the research  development and commercialization of monoclonal antibodies for two selected antigens from our portfolio of serine proteases  and dyax for the research  development and commercialization of cancer therapeutics focused on serine protease inhibitors 
each of these collaborations involve potential products that are at the preclinical stage of development  and we believe the risks described above that are associated with later stage products are less likely to materially impact us if they occur 
to date  we have not experienced difficulties with these collaborations that have had a material negative effect on our business or research and product development efforts  and we have not been negatively affected by consolidations involving potential collaborators 
however  it is possible that we could encounter difficulties with these collaborators in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may require additional funding  and our future access to capital is uncertain 
it is expensive to develop and commercialize cancer vaccines  monoclonal antibodies  small molecules and other new products 
we plan to continue to simultaneously conduct clinical trials and preclinical research for a number of product candidates  which is costly 
our product development efforts may not lead to commercial products  either because our product candidates fail to be found safe or effective in clinical trials or because we lack the necessary financial or other resources or relationships to pursue our programs through commercialization 
once commercialized  a product  including provenge  may not achieve revenues that exceed the costs of producing and selling it 
our capital and future revenues may not be sufficient to support the expenses of our operations  the development of commercial infrastructure  the costs of sales  and the conduct of our clinical trials and preclinical research 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund operations  conduct clinical trials  continue the research and development of our product candidates  and commercialize our product candidates 
we believe that our cash on hand  including our cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from our collaborative arrangements will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital 
table of contents requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may need additional financing within this time frame depending on a number of factors  including the following the costs of developing the physical resources and systems to support fda approval of provenge  if we seek such approval  the costs of preparing an application for fda approval of provenge  if we seek such approval  our timetable for and costs of scaling up manufacturing of provenge and its components  our timetable and costs for the development of marketing  manufacturing  information technology and other infrastructure and activities related to the commercialization of provenge  our degree of success in our phase trial of provenge  db  and in clinical trials of our other products  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development and clinical trial activities  the amount and timing of payments we receive from collaborators  the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments  and whether an acceptable collaboration for provenge is completed or changes in or terminations of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds  we may have to delay  reduce or eliminate our clinical trials and our development programs 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  including pursuant to our shelf registration statement  further dilution to our existing stockholders will result 
we may take longer to complete our clinical trials than we project  or we may not be able to complete them at all 
a number of factors  including unexpected delays in the initiation of clinical sites  slower than projected enrollment  competition with ongoing clinical trials and scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians  regulatory requirements  limits on manufacturing capacity and failure of a product candidate to meet required standards for administration to humans may cause significant delays in the completion of our clinical trials 
in addition  it may take longer than we project to achieve study endpoints  and complete data analysis for a trial 
we may not complete our clinical trials of provenge when or as projected or commence or complete clinical trials involving any of our other product candidates as projected or may not conduct them successfully 
we rely on academic institutions  physician practices and clinical research organizations to conduct  supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates 
we have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own 
third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol or applicable regulations 
we also rely on clinical research organizations to perform much of our data management and analysis 
they may not provide these services as required or in a timely manner 
if we fail to complete our phase trials of provenge  or if we experience material delays in completing those trials as currently planned  or we otherwise fail to commence or complete  or experience delays in  any of our other present or planned clinical trials  our ability to conduct our business as currently planned could materially suffer 
our development costs will increase if we experience any future delays in our clinical trials of provenge or other potential products or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than we currently plan 
if the delays or costs are significant  our financial results and our ability to commercialize provenge or our other product candidates will be adversely affected 

table of contents in april  the fda placed our da study of provenge on partial clinical hold and required us to provide additional information regarding the identity and functionality of provenge 
we submitted additional information  and the fda lifted the partial hold in october during this period we were permitted to continue treating patients already enrolled in the trial  but could not enroll new patients in da 
if testing of a particular product candidate does not yield successful results  then we will be unable to commercialize that product 
our product candidates in clinical trials must meet rigorous testing standards 
we must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our potential products in humans through extensive preclinical and clinical testing 
we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  the testing process that could delay or prevent commercialization of provenge or our other potential products  including the following safety and efficacy results from human clinical trials  such as our provenge trials  may show the product candidate to be less effective or safe than desired or those results may not be replicated in later clinical trials  the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  after reviewing relevant information  including preclinical testing or human clinical trial results  we or our collaborators may abandon or substantially restructure projects that we might previously have believed to be promising  including provenge  neuvenge  trp p and our monoclonal antibody programs  we  our collaborators or the fda may suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons  and the effects of our potential products may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that interrupt  delay or cause us  our collaborators or the fda to halt clinical trials or cause the fda or foreign regulatory authorities to deny approval of the potential product for any or all target indications 
d and da  our first phase clinical trials of provenge  did not meet their main objective of showing a statistically significant delay in the median time to disease progression in the overall patient population in the study 
data from our clinical trials may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda of provenge or our other potential products 
the clinical trials of provenge or our other product candidates may not continue or be completed as or when planned  and the fda may not approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale 
if we fail to demonstrate the safety or efficacy of a product candidate to the satisfaction of the fda  this will delay or prevent regulatory approval of that product candidate  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
commercialization of our product candidates in the united states requires fda approval  which may not be granted  and foreign commercialization requires similar approvals 
the fda can delay  limit or withhold approval of a product candidate for many reasons  including the following a product candidate may not demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy  the fda may interpret data from preclinical testing and clinical trials in different ways than we interpret the data or may require data that is different from what we obtained in our clinical trials  the fda may require additional information about the efficacy  safety  purity  stability  identity or functionality of a product candidate  
table of contents the fda may not approve our manufacturing processes or facilities  or the processes or facilities of our collaborators  and the fda may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations 
the fda also may approve a product for fewer indications than are requested or may condition approval on the performance of post approval clinical studies 
even if we receive fda and other regulatory approvals  our products may later exhibit adverse effects that limit or prevent their widespread use or that force us to withdraw those products from the market 
any product and its manufacturer will continue to be subject to strict regulations after approval 
any problems with an approved product or any violation of regulations could result in restrictions on the product  including its withdrawal from the market 
the process of obtaining approvals in foreign countries is subject to delay and failure for many of the same reasons 
the process of obtaining required fda and other regulatory approvals  including foreign approvals  is expensive  often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the products involved 
provenge and our other investigational active immunotherapies are novel  therefore  regulatory agencies may lack experience with them  which may lengthen the regulatory review process  increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of provenge and our other active immunotherapy products under development 
to date  the fda has not approved for commercial sale in the united states any cancer vaccine designed to stimulate the body s immune system cells to kill cancer cells directly 
consequently  there is no precedent for the successful commercialization of products based on our technologies in this area 
in addition  we have had only limited experience in filing and pursuing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals for marketing and commercial sale  which may impede our ability to obtain fda approvals 
we will not be able to commercialize any of our potential products until we obtain fda approval 
therefore  any delay in obtaining  or inability to obtain  fda approval of any of our product candidates could materially harm our business and reduce our stock price 
we must comply with extensive regulation  which is costly  time consuming and may subject us to unanticipated delays 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates  those product candidates may still face regulatory difficulties 
our activities  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and comparable authorities outside the united states 
preclinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety of a potential product 
the fda regulates preclinical studies under a series of regulations called the current good laboratory practices 
if we violate these regulations  the fda  in some cases  may invalidate the studies and require that we replicate those studies 
an investigational new drug application  or ind  must become effective before human clinical trials may commence 
the investigational new drug application is automatically effective days after receipt by the fda unless  before that time  the fda requests an extension to review the application  or raises concerns or questions about the design of the trials as described in the application 
in the latter case  any outstanding concerns must be resolved with the fda before clinical trials can proceed 
thus  the submission of an ind may not result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials in any given case 
after authorization is received  the fda retains authority to place the ind  and clinical trials under that ind  on clinical hold 
all of those involved in the preparation of a therapeutic drug for clinical trials or commercial sale  including contract manufacturers for provenge or neuvenge  and clinical trial investigators  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with a series of complex regulations called current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp and or the quality systems regulations  or qsr 
these regulations 
table of contents govern manufacturing processes and procedures and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale 
our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third party contractors must pass a pre approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of fda approval of provenge or any of our other potential products 
in addition  the fda may  at any time  audit our clinical trials or audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of provenge or our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted 
the fda also may  at any time following approval of a product for sale  audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our third party contractors 
if any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulation occurs independent of such an inspection or audit  we or the fda may require remedial measures that may be costly and or time consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility 
the fda may also disqualify a clinical trial in whole or in part from consideration in support of approval of a potential product for commercial sale or otherwise deny approval of that product 
any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could harm our business 
if we make changes in our manufacturing processes for a product candidate  including the substitution of components of provenge or the expansion of production capabilities to commercial scale  the fda and corresponding foreign authorities may require us to demonstrate that the changes have not caused the product candidate to differ significantly from that previously produced 
also  we may want to rely on results of prior preclinical studies and clinical trials performed using the form of the product candidate produced using the prior method or at the prior scale 
depending upon the type and degree of differences between the newer and older product candidate  we may be required to conduct additional studies or clinical trials to demonstrate that the newly produced component or product candidate is sufficiently similar to the previously produced material 
we have scaled up the antigen and other components used in the preparation of provenge to commercial manufacturing levels and plan to construct manufacturing facilities capable of meeting anticipated commercial demand 
in addition  we may make manufacturing changes to the components or to the manufacturing process 
these changes could result in delays in the development or regulatory approval of provenge or in reduction or interruption of commercial sales  if provenge is approved  any of which could materially harm our business 
if we or our contract manufacturer are not in compliance with regulatory requirements at any stage  including post marketing approval  we may be subject to criminal prosecution  fined  forced to remove a product from the market and or experience other adverse consequences  including delays  which could materially harm our financial results 
additionally  we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the promotion of our products 
we may also be required to undertake post marketing clinical trials 
if the results of such post marketing studies are not satisfactory  the fda may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us that may be expensive and or time consuming to fulfill 
in addition  if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products and additional marketing applications may be required 
our competitors may develop and market products that are less expensive  more effective  safer or reach the market sooner  which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any products we may commercialize 
competition in the cancer therapeutics field is intense and is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological development 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter our markets 
research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs that render provenge or our other potential products obsolete even before they begin to generate any revenue 
there are products currently under development by others that could compete with provenge or other products that we are developing 
for example  cell genesys  inc and therion biologics are developing prostate 
table of contents cancer vaccines that could potentially compete with provenge 
avi biopharma and therion are in phase clinical trials of their prostate cancer vaccines 
cell genesys has completed phase clinical trials of its prostate cancer vaccine and has initiated phase trials 
other products such as chemotherapeutics  antisense compounds  angiogenesis inhibitors and gene therapies for cancer are also under development by a number of companies and could potentially compete with provenge and our other product candidates 
a chemotherapeutic  taxotere  was approved by the fda in for the therapeutic treatment of metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer 
some of our competitors in the cancer therapeutics field have substantially greater research and development capabilities and manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
if our products receive marketing approval  but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace  our profitability and financial position will suffer 
market acceptance of our product candidates  if any  is uncertain 
even if provenge or any of our other potential products are approved and sold  physicians may not ultimately use them or may use them only in applications more restricted than we expect 
physicians will only prescribe a product if they determine  based on experience  clinical data  side effect profiles and other factors  that it is beneficial and preferable to other products then in use 
many other factors influence the adoption of new products  including marketing and distribution restrictions  course of treatment  adverse publicity  product pricing  the views of thought leaders in the medical community  and reimbursement by government and private third party payers 
failure to retain key personnel could impede our ability to develop our products and to obtain new collaborations or other sources of funding 
we depend  to a significant extent  on the efforts of our key employees  including senior management and senior scientific  clinical  regulatory and other personnel 
the development of new therapeutic products requires expertise from a number of different disciplines  some of which are not widely available 
we depend upon our scientific staff to discover new product candidates and to develop and conduct preclinical studies of those new potential products 
our clinical and regulatory staff is responsible for the design and execution of clinical trials in accordance with fda requirements and for the advancement of our product candidates toward fda approval 
the quality and reputation of our scientific  clinical and regulatory staff  especially the senior staff  and their success in performing their responsibilities  may directly influence the success of our product development programs 
in addition  our chief executive officer and other executive officers are involved in a broad range of critical activities  including providing strategic and operational guidance 
the loss of these individuals  or our inability to retain or recruit other key management and scientific  clinical  regulatory and other personnel  may delay or prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
we face intense competition for personnel from other companies  universities  public and private research institutions  government entities and other organizations 
we must expand our operations to commercialize our products  which we may not be able to do 
we will need to expand and effectively manage our operations and facilities to successfully pursue and complete development of provenge  develop the necessary commercial infrastructure  and pursue development of our other product candidates 
we will need to add manufacturing capability  information technology systems  a distribution network  and personnel related to these functions 
we will also need to add quality control  quality assurance  marketing and sales personnel  and personnel in all other areas of our operations  which may strain our existing managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
to compete effectively and manage growth in our personnel and capabilities  we must  among other things recruit  train  manage and motivate our employees  accurately forecast demand for our product candidates  and 
table of contents expand existing facilities  develop manufacturing facilities  information technology systems and a distribution network  and other operational and financial systems 
we have no experience in commercial scale manufacturing of provenge  the installation and management of large scale information technology systems  or the management of a large scale distribution network 
we also have no experience in sales  marketing or distribution of provenge or our other potential products 
as we begin to build our sales capability in anticipation of the approval and commercial launch of provenge  we may be unable to successfully recruit an adequate number of qualified sales representatives or retain a third party to provide sales  marketing or distribution resources 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  recruit required personnel or expand our operations within our planned time and budget  our product development and commercialization efforts for provenge or our other product candidates could be curtailed or delayed which could harm our business 
we have no commercial or other large scale manufacturing experience and may rely on third party manufacturers  which will limit our ability to control the availability of  and manufacturing costs for  our product candidates 
to be successful  our product candidates must be capable of being manufactured in sufficient quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
we have no commercial or other large scale manufacturing experience 
we rely on third parties for certain aspects of the commercial and clinic trial manufacture of provenge  and its components and our other product candidates 
a limited number of contract manufacturers are capable of manufacturing the components of provenge or the final manufacture of provenge 
if we cannot contract for large scale manufacturing capabilities that we require on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties with manufacturers and cannot manufacture the contracted components or product candidate ourselves  we may not be able to conduct clinical trials as planned or to meet demand for provenge  if it is approved  any of which could harm our business 
it may be difficult or impossible to economically manufacture provenge or our other product candidates on a commercial scale 
manufacturing and other costs for any or all of our product candidates may reduce or limit their profitability and impair or prevent us from successfully commercializing them 
we have contracted with diosynth rtp  inc to assist us in the production of the antigen used in the preparation of provenge 
we currently do not have a long term contract for the commercial manufacture of the antigen used in the preparation of provenge 
while we plan to negotiate such a contract with a third party manufacturer  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all 
failure to successfully negotiate such an agreement could delay or impede the commercialization of provenge 
we operate a manufacturing facility for the preparation of provenge for our clinical trials 
we also contract with third parties to provide these services 
these facilities may not be sufficient to meet our needs for provenge and other clinical trials 
to manufacture provenge in commercial quantities ourselves  we will need to invest substantial additional funds 
we will also be required to hire and train a significant number of employees and comply with applicable regulations for these facilities  which are extensive 
we may not be able to develop manufacturing facilities that both meet regulatory requirements and are sufficient for commercial use 
we also will rely upon contract manufacturers for components of provenge for commercial sale  if provenge is approved for sale 
we have contracts with contract manufacturers for commercial level production for some  but not all of these components 
while we plan to negotiate contracts for commercial level production with contract manufacturers for all components we do not produce ourselves  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all 
failure to negotiate such contracts could delay or prevent the successful commercialization of provenge 

table of contents in addition  problems with any of our or our contract manufacturers facilities or processes could result in failure to produce or a delay in production of adequate supplies of antigen  components or finished provenge 
this could delay or reduce commercial sales and harm our business 
any prolonged interruption in the operations of our or our contract manufacturers facilities could result in cancellation of shipments  loss of components in the process of being manufactured or a shortfall in available inventory 
a number of factors could cause interruptions  including the inability of a supplier to provide raw materials  equipment malfunctions or failures  damage to a facility due to natural disasters  changes in fda regulatory requirements or standards that require modifications to our manufacturing processes  action by the fda or by us that results in the halting or slowdown of production of components or finished product due to regulatory issues  a contract manufacturer going out of business or failing to produce product as contractually required or other similar factors 
because our manufacturing processes and those of our contractors are highly complex and are subject to a lengthy fda approval process  alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or at all 
difficulties or delays in our or our contract manufacturers manufacturing and supply of components or finished product could delay completion of our clinical trials  increase our costs  damage our reputation and  for provenge  if it is approved for sale  cause us to lose revenue or market share 
we may also experience insufficient available capacity to manufacture or have manufactured for us components or finished product for others of our product candidates which could cause shortfalls of available inventory and an inability to supply our clinical trials for either a short period of time or an extended period of time 
we are dependent on single source vendors for some of our components 
we currently depend on single source vendors for some of the components necessary for our active immunotherapy candidates  including provenge 
there are  in general  relatively few alternative sources of supply for these components 
while these vendors have produced our active immunotherapy components with acceptable quality  quantity and cost in the past  they may be unable or unwilling to meet our future demands for our clinical trials or commercial sale 
establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these components could take a substantial amount of time and it may be difficult to establish replacement vendors who meet regulatory requirements 
if we have to switch to a replacement vendor  the manufacture and delivery of provenge or others of our active immunotherapy candidates could be interrupted for an extended period  adversely affecting our business 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or to defend against infringement claims  we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably 
we invent and develop technologies that are the basis for or incorporated in our potential products 
we protect our technology through numerous united states and foreign patent filings  trademarks and trade secrets that we own or license 
our patent applications are in various stages of prosecution 
we expect that we will continue to file and prosecute patent applications and that our success depends in part on our ability to establish and defend our proprietary rights in the technologies that are the subject of issued patents and patent applications 
the fact that we have filed a patent application or that a patent has issued  however  does not ensure that we will have meaningful protection from competition with regard to the underlying technology or product 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties may not result in issued patents 
patents may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or advantages against competitors with similar or competing technologies 
thus  any patent that we own or license from third parties may not provide adequate protection against competitors 
we are also subject to the risk of claims  whether meritorious or not  that our active immunotherapies infringe a patent owned by a third party 
if a lawsuit making any such claims were brought against us  we would 
table of contents assert that the patent at issue is either invalid or not infringed 
we may not be able to establish non infringement  however  and we may not be able to establish invalidity of the other party s patent 
if we are found to infringe a valid patent  we could be required to seek a license or discontinue or delay commercialization of the affected products  and we could be required to pay substantial damages  which could materially harm our business 
litigation relating to the ownership and use of intellectual property is expensive  and our position as a relatively small company in an industry dominated by very large companies may cause us to be at a disadvantage in defending our property rights 
even if we are able to defend our positions  the cost of doing so may adversely affect our profitability 
we have not experienced significant patent litigation 
this may reflect  however  the fact that we have not yet commercialized any products 
we may be subject to such litigation and may not be able to protect our intellectual property at a reasonable cost  if such litigation is initiated 
we may collaborate with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company in the commercialization  marketing and distribution of provenge in the united states  and may collaborate with other companies in the development and commercialization of our other potential products 
in some cases  we may develop a product candidate in collaboration with other companies in order to share the development risk  to gain access to complementary technologies or facilities or for other reasons 
the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology  which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge  could impede our ability to enter into collaborative relationships on an advantageous basis or at all 
we also rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know how that we seek to protect  in part  by using confidentiality agreements 
our policy is to require our officers  employees  consultants  contractors  manufacturers  outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements 
these agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances 
we also require signed confidentiality agreements from companies that receive our confidential data 
for employees  consultants and contractors  we require confidentiality agreements providing that all inventions conceived while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as our exclusive property 
it is possible  however  that these parties may breach those agreements  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets or unpatentable know how will otherwise become known to or be independently developed by competitors 
the availability and amount of reimbursement for our potential products and the manner in which government and private payers may reimburse for our potential products is uncertain  we may face challenges from government or private payers that adversely affect reimbursement for our potential products 
we expect that many of the patients who seek treatment with provenge or any other products that are approved for marketing  will be eligible for medicare benefits 
other patients may be covered by private health plans or uninsured 
the application of existing medicare regulations and interpretive rulings to newly approved products  especially novel products such as ours  is not certain  and those regulations and interpretive rulings are subject to change 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act  enacted in december  provides for a reduction in the medicare reimbursement rates for many drugs  including oncology therapeutics  which may adversely affect reimbursement for provenge  if it is approved for sale  or others of our product candidates 
if we are unable to obtain or retain adequate levels of reimbursement from medicare or from private health plans  our ability to sell provenge and our other potential products will be adversely affected 
medicare regulations and interpretive rulings also may determine who may be reimbursed for certain services 
this may adversely affect our ability to market or sell provenge or our other potential products  if approved 
federal  state and foreign governments continue to propose legislation designed to contain or reduce health care costs 
legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of products like our potential products may change further or be adopted before provenge or any of our potential products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives by governments or third party payers could decrease the price that we receive for any one or all of our 
table of contents potential products or increase patient coinsurance to a level that makes provenge and our other products under development unaffordable 
in addition  government and private health plans persistently challenge the price and cost effectiveness of therapeutic products 
accordingly  these third parties may ultimately not consider provenge or any or all of our products under development to be cost effective  which could result in products not being covered under their health plans or covered only at a lower price 
any of these initiatives or developments could prevent us from successfully marketing and selling any of our potential products 
we are unable to predict what impact the medicare modernization act or other future regulation or third party payer initiatives  if any  relating to reimbursement for provenge or any of our other potential products will have on sales of provenge or those other product candidates  if any of them are approved for sale

our operations produce hazardous waste products  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials

although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials complies with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of such substances  and store our low level radioactive waste at our facilities until the materials are no longer considered radioactive 
we may be required to incur further costs to comply with current or future environmental and safety regulations 
in addition  in the event of accidental contamination or injury from these materials  we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources 
if we do not progress in our programs as anticipated  our stock price could decrease 
for planning purposes  we estimate the timing of a variety of clinical  regulatory and other milestones  such as when a certain product candidate will enter clinical development  when a clinical trial will be completed or when an application for regulatory approval will be filed

we may be subject to litigation that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome 
our business may bring us into conflict with our licensees  licensors or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships  or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours 
if we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties  we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us 
that litigation is likely to be expensive and may require a significant amount of management s time and attention  at the expense of other aspects of our business 
the outcome of litigation is always uncertain  and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages  enjoin us
