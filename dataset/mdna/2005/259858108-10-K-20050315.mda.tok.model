item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  in licensing  development and commercialization of novel drug candidates for central nervous system  or cns and other disorders  including cardiovascular  that involve alterations in neuronal processing 
in  we licensed four of our product candidates from wyeth indiplon  for the treatment of insomnia  bicifadine  for the treatment of pain  ocinaplon  for the treatment of anxiety  and dov  for the treatment of depression and other indications 
we sublicensed the worldwide development and commercialization of indiplon to neurocrine in in exchange for the right to receive payments upon the achievement of certain clinical development milestones and royalties based on product sales  if any 
neurocrine subsequently entered into a worldwide development and commercialization agreement with pfizer for indiplon 
on august   we entered into an agreement with merck for the worldwide development and commercialization of all indications for dov  and certain indications for dov  in exchange for a million up front payment and the right to receive further payments of up to million upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties based on product net sales  if any 
the up front payment has been deferred and is being amortized to revenue over the estimated research and development period of months 
the time period of the development period is a significant estimate used in the preparation of our financial statements and is subject to merck developing the compound in accordance with the last estimated development schedule presented by merck 
as such this development period estimate may fluctuate from period to period and this fluctuation might be significant 
for example  if as of january  we were to increase by the estimated development period  we would record approximately  less of revenue in future milestone payments  if any  will also be recorded over the remaining term of the collaboration 
in  we received a million milestone payment from neurocrine for the nda filing for indiplon 
however  because neurocrine has reported that the nda filing was not accepted by the fda and our agreement with neurocrine indicates that the million milestone is earned once an nda has been submitted according to certain fda regulations  we will not record this payment as revenue until such time that a nda has been filed and accepted by the fda 
since our inception  we have incurred significant operating losses and we expect to do so for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have depended upon equity and debt financings and license fee and milestone payments from our collaborative partners and licensees to fund our research and product development programs and expect to do so for the foreseeable future 
we have a relatively limited history of operations and anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate for several reasons  including the timing and extent of research and development efforts  the timing and extent of adding new employees and infrastructure  the timing of milestone  license fee and royalty payments and the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals 
our revenue has consisted primarily of license fees and milestone payments from our collaborative partners and licensees 
we record revenue on an accrual basis when amounts are considered collectible 
in accordance with eitf  we evaluate all new agreements to determine if they are a single unit of accounting or separable 
revenue received in advance of performance obligations  or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services  is deferred and amortized over the performance period 
revenue from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process is recorded when the milestone is achieved 
contract revenues are recorded as the services are performed 
license and milestone revenue are typically not consistent or recurring in nature 
our revenue has fluctuated from year to year and quarter to quarter and this will likely continue 
our operating expenses consist primarily of license expense  costs associated with research and development and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
license expense consists of milestone payments associated with our license agreement with wyeth and license fees paid in connection with the termination of the biovail agreement 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and other related costs of our personnel dedicated to research and development activities  clinical and preclinical trial expenses  including toxicology studies  costs of manufacturing clinical and preclinical trial materials and preclinical studies  and professional fees related to clinical trials 
research and development expense also includes our expenses related to development activities of nascime limited  our wholly owned subsidiary 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of the costs of our senior management  finance and administrative staff  business insurance  professional fees and costs associated with being a public reporting entity 
we expect research and development expense to increase substantially in the foreseeable future 
we have recently initiated three phase iii clinical trials for bicifadine  a phase iii clinical trial for ocinaplon and a phase i clinical trial for dov  in  we intend to initiate four pivotal efficacy clinical trials  two phase ii clinical trials and six additional phase i clinical trials for bicifadine  two additional phase i clinical trials and a phase ii clinical trial for dov  and a phase i clinical trial for dov  in addition  we intend to continue the clinical development of dov  for retained indications  that is  other than depression  anxiety and substance abuse 
we also expect to increase our expenditures in fortifying our patent portfolio for each of our lead product candidates 
it is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of products to each take five to ten years or more  and for total development costs for each to exceed million 
we are not responsible financially for the clinical program for indiplon or for dov  and we are unable to estimate the amount of expenditures necessary to complete any of such product candidate s development 
as of december   we have spent approximately million and million on the development of bicifadine and ocinaplon  respectively  in connection with their clinical development programs 
additionally  we have incurred million in technology license fees for the two products and the elan technology and million on the acquisition of the remaining rights to these products from elan as described below 
as of december   we have incurred approximately million  million and million in development expenses for dov  dov  and dov  respectively 
we expect that the development of our six product candidates in clinical development will require substantial additional time and expense 
the time and cost of completing the clinical development of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors  including the disease or medical condition to be treated  clinical trial design and endpoints  availability of patients to participate in trials  the results of clinical trials  the number of clinical trials required to be conducted  unanticipated trials  the length of time of the regulatory review process  the relative efficacy of the product versus treatments already approved and our ability to enter into new development collaborations 
in light of these many uncertainties  we are unable to estimate the length of time or costs required to complete the development of these product candidates 
in january  elan loaned us million in the form of a convertible promissory note to fund our investment in dov bermuda 
in may  elan converted the entire outstanding principal and accrued interest of this note totaling million on that date into  shares of our common stock 
elan agreed  in january  to lend us up to million to fund our pro rata share of research and development funding in dov bermuda 
for this purpose  we issued to elan a convertible line of credit promissory note that bears interest at per annum compounded semi annually on the amount outstanding 
this convertible line of credit promissory note was sold to an institutional holder during and upon maturity on january   was converted into  shares of our common stock 
please refer to note of our financial statements under part ii  item of this form k 
during and  we granted options and warrants to outside consultants at fair value on the date of grant in exchange for future services 
these options and warrants are required to be accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas accounting for stock based compensation and eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services and at the fair value of the consideration received  or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever may be more readily measured 
as the performance of services is completed  we revalue the options and warrants that have been earned during the period 
we valued these securities at the fair value using a black scholes methodology 
during  and  in connection with the grant of these stock options and warrants to outside consultants  we recorded expenses totaling   and  respectively 
we may be required to record additional expense on a quarterly basis based upon increases in the fair value of our common stock 
please refer to note of our financial statements  stock option plans non employee options and warrants  included under part ii  item of this form k 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
revenue decreased  to million from million in in  our revenue was comprised of million of amortization of the million fee we received on the signing of the license  research and development agreement for our collaboration with merck and  of contract services revenue associated with work we performed under the collaboration 
the up front payment has been deferred and is being amortized to revenue over the estimated research and development period of months 
in  revenue was comprised solely of the recognition of million of deferred revenue from the biovail agreement as described below 
on march  we entered into a separation agreement with biovail that provided for the return of our december patent for the immediate and controlled release formulation of diltiazem and termination of the exclusive license agreement with biovail for development of the dov compound for the treatment of angina and hypertension 
as the separation agreement ends our performance obligations  we recognized the remaining deferred revenue  totaling million as of december   as revenue in the first quarter of going forward  we will not record any additional revenue from biovail for this product candidate 
license expense 
license expense increased million to million in from million in license expense for is comprised of the million paid to wyeth for the licensing of certain rights to dov  to merck in august as this milestone payment is prior to fda approval  the entire amount was expensed in the third quarter of in connection with the termination in of the biovail agreement and the return of the patent as described below  we agreed to a million payment to biovail upon signing 
this payment was to obtain the patent and related clinical data from biovail 
as this product will require fda approval prior to marketing and the patent has no alternative future use  we expensed the entire license fee in in january  biovail and we entered into a license  research and development agreement to develop  manufacture and market dov diltiazem for the treatment of angina and hypertension 
through january  dov diltiazem was being jointly developed through the collaborative arrangement 
in march  we entered into a separation agreement with biovail that provided for the return of our december patent for the immediate release and controlled release formulations of diltiazem and termination of the exclusive license agreement with biovail for the development of dov diltiazem 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased million to million in from million in however  in  research and development expense included million for the purchase of the remaining interest in bicifadine and ocinaplon discussed below 
therefore the overall relative increase was approximately million of which approximately million of the increase was attributable to increased costs associated with the clinical development for bicifadine  including an increase of million in manufacturing and packaging related costs and million in toxicology costs  and million in clinical trial expenditures 
in addition we increased our expenditures on two of our preclinical compounds in preparation for moving these two compounds into clinical trials in for dov  we increased our expenditures by million and for dov  by million 
we increased our expenditures on dov  by  however as this compound has now been licensed to merck we do not expect to incur additional expenditures in relation to this compound 
as a result of the prolonged clinical trial hold for ocinaplon  we decreased our expenditures on this compound in by million and also had a decrease in costs for dov  of  these decreases were offset by an increase in expenditures for dov diltiazem of  and in our general preclinical and research and development program of  the remaining increase in research and development expense was attributable to an increase in costs associated with payroll and overhead allocated of million offset by a decrease in professional fees including consulting and medical writing of  non cash compensation expense for consultants and employees decreased  in the fourth quarter of we paid million for the purchase of elan s interest in nascime limited and the joint venture product candidates  bicifadine and ocinaplon  and  for transfer taxes associated with the acquisition 
the purchase relates to early stage technology that  in our opinion  has not yet reached technological feasibility  since the products will ultimately require regulatory approval prior to commercialization 
therefore  the million purchase price was expensed as in process research and development in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased office and related expenses of  increased professional fees of  and increased payroll related costs associated with our increase in personnel of  the increase in office and related expenses was primarily related to an increase in directors and officers insurance of  fees and permits of  travel and entertainment expense of  and rent expense of  the increase in professional fees was primarily related to an increase in accounting fees of  and an increase in recruitment fees of  offset by a reduction in legal expenses of  the increase in payroll costs was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries of  and an increase in payroll overhead of  offset by a decrease in non cash compensation expense for consultants and employees of  interest income 
interest income increased  to  from  in primarily due to the increase in average interest rates over the period 
interest expense 
interest expense remained relatively unchanged as we recorded million in and million in in may  the holder of the convertible promissory note converted the outstanding principal and accrued interest totaling million into  shares of our common stock  thus reducing the contractual interest expense recorded in by  from we recorded contractual interest expense of  on our convertible line of credit promissory note in and  in the comparable period in both the convertible promissory note and convertible line of credit promissory note contained interest payable either in cash or common stock at the holder s option 
in accordance with eitf  we evaluate this conversion feature each time interest is accrued to the notes 
this feature resulted in additional interest expense of million in a net increase of  from  due primarily to the increase in the fair value of our common stock offset by the reduction due to the conversion of the convertible promissory note 
on january   the convertible line of credit promissory note was converted into  shares of our common stock 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net decreased million to  in other expense  net in from million in other income  net in in  other income  net  consisted primarily of the million in other income attributable to the directors and officers insurance recovery discussed below  offset by a decrease in the value of warrants to acquire neurocrine common stock of  and loss on sale of securities of  following a decline in the aftermarket trading price of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering  beginning on april   a number of class action lawsuits were filed naming us as defendants  in addition to certain of our officers and directors and certain of our underwriters 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement  which was approved by the court on april   to settle these lawsuits 
in connection with the settlement  we reached an agreement with the primary carrier of our directors and officers liability insurance policy 
in that regard  our insurance carrier paid million to us in settlement of the shareholder class action lawsuits 
income tax benefit 
in  taking into account the million up front fee we received on the closing of the license  research and development agreement for our collaboration with merck  we generated taxable income for the tax year under the new jersey alternative minimum assessment 
as a result  taxable income and recorded state tax expense for the third quarter of was  we have since completed our review of taxable income for the year ended december  and determined that although we have generated taxable income in  as a result of a change in tax strategy  it is less than has been estimated as of september  thus  we revised income tax expense to  in the fourth quarter which resulted in a tax benefit of  for the fourth quarter of the income tax expense was offset by a  income tax benefit as we sold a portion of our previous years state net operating losses as part of the new jersey economic development authority technology business tax certificate program 
in  we sold a portion of our new jersey net operating loss as part of the program  thus recognized a income tax benefit of  years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased  to million from million in in  revenue was comprised solely of the recognition of million of deferred revenue from the biovail agreement as described below 
in  our revenue was primarily comprised of million in amortization of the million fee we received on signing of the license  research and development agreement for our collaboration with biovail in january on march  we entered into a separation agreement with biovail that provided for the return of our december patent for the immediate and controlled release formulation of diltiazem and termination of the exclusive license agreement with biovail for development of the dov compound for the treatment of angina and hypertension 
as the separation agreement ends our performance obligations  we recognized the remaining deferred revenue  totaling million as of december   as revenue in the first quarter of going forward  we will not record any additional revenue from biovail for this product candidate 
royalty and licensing expense 
in connection with the termination of the biovail agreement and the return of the patent as described above  we agreed to a million payment to biovail upon signing 
this payment was to obtain the patent and related clinical data from biovail 
as this product will require fda approval prior to marketing and the patent has no alternative future use  we expensed the entire license fee 
thus in the first quarter of  we recorded an expense of million 
there was no such expense in the comparable period in research and development expense 
research and development expense for includes of the research and development expenses of dov bermuda as we are now consolidating the results of dov bermuda effective january  research and development expense increased million to million for from million in approximately million of the increase in research and development expense was attributable to increased costs associated with the clinical development for ocinaplon and bicifadine  including an increase of million in manufacturing and packaging related costs  million in toxicology costs and  in clinical trial costs 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of we paid million for the purchase of nascime limited and the product candidates  bicifadine and ocinaplon  and  for transfer taxes associated with the acquisition 
as the purchase relates to early stage technology that  in our opinion  has not yet reached technological feasibility  as the products will ultimately require regulatory approval prior to commercialization  the million purchase price was expensed as in process research and development in the fourth quarter of approximately  of the increase in research and development expense was attributable to net increased costs related to additional clinical development for our other compounds including dov  of  dov diltiazem of  and preclinical compounds of  offset by a decrease in costs for dov  of  the remaining increase in research and development expense was attributable to an increase in costs associated with payroll and overhead allocated of million  an increase in professional fees including consulting and medical writing of  and an increase in travel related expenses of  non cash compensation expense increased  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for includes of the general and administrative expenses of dov bermuda as we are now consolidating the results of dov bermuda effective january  general and administrative expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased office and related expenses of  increased professional fees of  and increased payroll related costs associated with our increase in personnel of  the increase in office and related expenses was primarily related to an increase in directors and officers insurance of  an increase in costs related to operating a public company of  an increase in amortization and depreciation expense of  an increase in travel and entertainment expense of  an increase in rent expense of  and an increase of  as we expanded operations 
the increase in professional fees was primarily related to an increase in accounting fees of  an increase in recruitment fees of  and an increase in consulting fees of  offset by a decrease in legal expenses of  the increase in payroll costs was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries of  and an increase in payroll overhead of  offset by a decrease in bonuses of  and a decrease in non cash compensation expense of  loss in investment in dov bermuda 
in  loss in investment in dov bermuda represented our of the expenses of dov bermuda related to elan s formulation work for the joint venture products and administrative expenses 
as we are now consolidating the results of dov bermuda  all such expenses are now recorded in research and development expense and general and administrative expense 
interest income 
interest income decreased  to  in from million in the increase was due to lower average cash balances offset by the fact that cash proceeds from the initial public offering earned interest for eight months in versus twelve months in interest expense 
interest expense increased  to million in from million in both the elan convertible promissory note and convertible line of credit promissory note contain interest that will be paid  at elan s option  either in cash or our common stock 
in accordance with eitf  we evaluate this conversion feature each time interest is accrued on the notes 
this feature resulted in interest expense of million in  an increase of  from  due primarily to the increase in the fair value of our common stock 
to the extent the value of our common stock is at or above per share with respect to the convertible promissory note or per share with respect to the convertible line of credit promissory note  we will continue to incur additional interest expense each time interest is accrued on the notes 
this increase was accompanied by higher interest expense recorded due to higher outstanding balances  owing to accrued interest on the convertible promissory note and the convertible line of credit promissory note 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net decreased million to million in net income in from million of other expense  net in in  other income  net  consisted primarily of the million in other income attributable to the directors and officers insurance recovery discussed below  offset by a decrease in the value of warrants to acquire neurocrine common stock of  and loss on sale of securities of  following a decline in the aftermarket trading price of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering  beginning on april   a number of class action lawsuits were filed naming us as defendants  in addition to certain of our officers and directors and certain of our underwriters 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement  which was approved by the court on april   to settle these lawsuits 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  in we paid the class members inclusive of their attorneys fees and costs  in cash and issued them six year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
upon issuance in june  the value of the warrants was determined to be million 
in connection with the settlement  we reached an agreement with the primary carrier of our directors and officers liability insurance policy 
in that regard  our insurance carrier paid million to us in settlement of the shareholder class action lawsuits 
in  other income expense  net consisted primarily of million for settlement of the securities class action lawsuit discussed above and  of expense associated with the net decrease in the value of the warrants to acquire neurocrine common stock  which we earned in upon the achievement of a certain milestone offset by the corresponding decrease in the liability to wyeth 
income tax benefit 
in  we sold a portion of our new jersey net operating loss as part of the new jersey economic development authority technology business tax certificate program 
we recognized no such benefit in liquidity and capital resources for the three years ended december   and  we funded our operations principally from sales of our equity and debt securities and license revenues 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million compared with million at december  at december   we had working capital of million 
in january  we completed the issuance of an additional million aggregate principal amount of the company s convertible subordinated debentures due net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  amounted to million  as compared to net cash used in operations of million in the increase in cash provided in operations resulted primarily from the up front licensing payment of million discussed above offset by an increase in clinical development activities and increases in compensation expense 
net cash provided by operations benefited from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million due to an increase in volume and timing of payments 
non cash expenses related to stock based compensation  interest expense and depreciation and amortization expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
non cash amortization of premium paid on marketable securities and depreciation in the value of investments was  million and  net in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million for the comparable period in this fluctuation resulted primarily from the timing differences in investment purchases  sales and maturities and the fluctuations in our portfolio mix between cash equivalents and short term investment holdings 
we expect similar fluctuations to continue in future periods 
net cash provided by financing activities during the period ended december  was million as compared to million in the comparable period in this increase was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the issuance of million of subordinated convertible debentures in december and million from the sale of our common stock to an institutional investor in march in the period ended december   we generated million from the sale of our common stock to a group of funds led by orbimed advisors  llc in july we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements until at least mid our convertible line of credit promissory note matured on january   at which time the principal amount and unpaid accrued interest was converted into  shares of common stock 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors  including our progress with research and development  our ability to establish  and the scope of  any new collaborations  the progress and success of clinical trials and preclinical studies of our product candidates  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and the note holders choice of having the notes repaid in cash or converting the notes into our common stock 
in addition to the foregoing  our future capital uses and requirements are also dependent in part on the ability of our licensees and collaborative partners to meet their obligations to us  including the fulfillment of their development and commercialization responsibilities in respect of our product candidates 
our sublicensee and collaborative partners  neurocrine  pfizer and merck  may encounter conflicts of interest  changes in business strategy or other business issues  or they may acquire or develop rights to competing products  all of which could adversely affect their ability or willingness to fulfill their obligations to us and  consequently  require us to satisfy  through the commitment of additional funds or personnel or both  any shortfalls in their performance 
to meet future capital requirements  we may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative agreements with corporate partners or from other sources 
if adequate funds are not available  or available on an acceptable basis  we may be required to curtail or delay significantly one or more of our product development programs 
in addition  future milestone payments under some of our collaborative or license agreements are contingent upon our meeting particular research or development goals 
the amount and timing of future milestone payments are contingent upon the terms of each collaborative or license agreement 
milestone performance criteria are specific to each agreement and based upon future performance 
therefore  we are subject to significant variation in the timing and amount of our revenues  milestone expenses and results of operations from period to period 
contractual obligations future minimum payments for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to december   are as follows years ended december  thereafter total in thousands convertible subordinated debentures convertible line of credit promissory note operating leases total included is interest payments of approximately million annually through on january   the holder converted the entire balance of the note and the accrued interest into  shares of our common stock 
the table above excludes future milestones and royalties that may be owed to wyeth  elan and biovail under terms of existing agreements as payments are contingent upon future events 
we do not expect to pay any royalties under these agreements in in addition  the table excludes an additional million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures issued in january and the related interest payments of  annually through  if not earlier converted into shares of our common stock 
in may  we licensed from wyeth  on an exclusive  worldwide basis  indiplon  bicifadine  ocinaplon and dov  we have the right to develop and commercialize these compounds  including the right to grant sublicenses to third parties  subject to wyeth s right of first refusal 
in february  we entered into agreements to reorganize our exclusive license agreement with wyeth in respect of these four compounds and our sublicense agreement with neurocrine in respect of indiplon 
under the restated license agreements  if we sell the products ourselves  we are obligated to pay wyeth royalties of of net sales for ocinaplon and dov  and of net sales for bicifadine  and milestones of million for ocinaplon and million for bicifadine upon nda filing and million each for bicifadine  ocinaplon and dov  upon a nda approval 
the royalty rate for bicifadine  ocinaplon and dov  will increase by should we partner or sublicense that compound 
in addition  should we partner or sublicense a compound  the next milestone payable to wyeth for that compound will be accelerated to become due upon partnering 
as we have licensed certain rights to dov  to merck  should merck achieve sales on this compound  we will owe wyeth a royalty of on those sales and the next milestone payable to them of million has been accelerated and paid in as part of the reorganization  neurocrine acquired wyeth s interest under the license covering indiplon 
accordingly  the reorganization with neurocrine allows neurocrine to pay to us royalty and milestone payments net of those amounts that would be owed by us to wyeth under the earlier agreement 
in connection with elan s license grant to us in october  elan is entitled to receive up to an aggregate of million when bicifadine and ocinaplon are licensed or come to market 
in connection with the biovail separation agreement  we face contingent payments by us to biovail of million upon issuance of marketing authorization for dov diltiazem and up to million based upon sales  if any 
the table also excludes any severance or termination payments that would be due to certain of our employees under their employment contracts should they be terminated without cause or terminate following a change of control prior to the expiration of their contract term as the amounts are not determinable at this time 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of fasb statement  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  and thus we will adopt the standard in the third quarter of as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  since the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation payments for employees results in a higher non cash cost than the currently used intrinsic method of calculating such costs  stock based compensation expense is expected to rise 
the adoption of sfas r s fair value method is expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations  while it will not impact our overall financial position 
due the timing of the release of sfas r  management has not yet completed the analysis of the ultimate impact that this statement will have on our operating results or financial position  nor the method of adoption for this new standard 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
the amendments made by statement are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the amendment also eliminates the exception of for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a narrower exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the provisions of the statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial condition or our results of operations 
in march  the eitf reached a final consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measure of the impairment loss 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for other than temporary impairments on debt and equity investments 
in september  the fasb delayed the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance contained in eitf  although  the disclosure requirements remain effective 
the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
collaboration and license agreements 
revenue from up front payments  technology license fees and milestone payments received for the delivery of products and services representing the culmination of a separate earnings process is recognized when due and the amounts are judged to be collectible 
revenue from up front payments  technology license fees and milestone payments received in connection with other rights and services  which represent continuing obligations to us  is deferred and recognized over the term of the continuing obligation 
historically  recognition of revenue for such an up front payment included an estimate by management as to the development period associated with such up front payments 
on august   we entered into an agreement with merck for the worldwide development and commercialization of all indications for dov  and certain indications for dov  in exchange for a million up front payment and the right to receive further payments of up to million upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties based on product net sales  if any 
the up front payment has been deferred and is being amortized to revenue over the estimated research and development period of months 
the time period of the development period is a significant estimate used in the preparation of our financial statements and is subject to merck developing the compound in accordance with the last estimated development schedule presented by merck 
as such  this development period estimate may fluctuate from period to period and this fluctuation might be significant 
for example  if as of january  we were to increase by the estimated development period  we would record approximately  less of revenue in research and development 
research and development costs are expensed when incurred and include allocations for payroll and related costs and other corporate overhead 
costs assigned to assets to be used in a particular research and development project acquired that have no alternative further use are charged to expenses as in process research and development expense as of the date of consummation 
stock based compensation 
in general  we grant stock options to employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize no compensation expense on these employee stock option grants 
prior to our common stock becoming publicly traded  we granted stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize the difference between the exercise price and fair market value as compensation expense  which is recognized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the stock options 
our accounting treatment will change effective the third quarter of see above under recent accounting pronouncements 
we also have  in the past  granted options and warrants to outside consultants at fair value on the date of grant in exchange for future services 
these options and warrants are required to be accounted for in accordance with sfas accounting for stock based compensation and eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services at the fair value of the consideration received  or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever may be more readily measured 
as the performance of services is completed  we revalue the options and warrants that have been earned during the period 
we value these securities at the fair value using a black scholes methodology 
investments 
we review our investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in value that may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge by writing down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  we take into consideration a wide range of objective and subjective information  including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical decline in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity  public filings and statements made by the issuer 
we have not identified any investments with other than temporary declines in value as of december  income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets at december  that are totally offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that the criteria for recognition have not been met 
we believe that a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will continue to be required if losses are reported in future periods 
if  as a result of profitable operations  we determine that we are able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  increasing income or decreasing loss in the period in which such a determination is made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues  earnings  financial position and various disclosures 
we base our estimates on circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
our significant accounting policies are also described in note to our financial statements included under part ii  item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s to date  we have invested our cash balances with substantial financial institutions 
in the future  the primary objective of our investment activities will be to maximize the income we receive from our investments consistent with preservation of principal and minimum risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and corporate obligations 
due to the short holding period of these types of investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure
