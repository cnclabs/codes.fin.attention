the partnership title to the royalties is held by a partnership of which the ll e royalty trust and burlington resources are the only partners 
the partnership was formed solely for the purpose of owning the royalties  and its only functions are the ownership of such interests and the related receipt of funds  payment of expenses  disbursement of revenues from the royalties and preparation of certain reports to jpmorgan chase bank  na receipts and payments the terms of the trust agreement  the conveyances and the partnership agreement between the trust and the company the partnership agreement provide that the working interest owner will use its best efforts to make payments to the partnership  the partnership will make payments to the trust  and the trust and partnership will use reasonable efforts to pay expenses  only on the monthly record date defined as the close of business on the fifth day of the month unless such fifth day is not a business day  in which case it will be the next business day following the fifth day for each monthly period defined as the period which commences on the day following a monthly record date and continuing through and including the succeeding monthly record date 
for taxable years beginning on or after january   the partnership has been required to use the accrual method of accounting  and thus the portion of the trust s income attributable to the partnership and reported to the unit holders is likewise on the accrual basis 
consequently  the unit holder required to recognize income and expense for a monthly period may not be the unit holder entitled to the monthly income amount

the trust agreement and the partnership agreement provide that the trustee or the partnership may establish cash contingency reserves in the event that a either i a claim is asserted against or is likely to be asserted against the trust or the partnership  whichever is the case  and the trustee has received an opinion of counsel stating that the claim has a reasonable probability of succeeding or ii a claim against the trust or the partnership  whichever is the case  has been successful but is not currently due and payable  and b the amount or probable amount of such claim is such that it cannot be satisfied out of monthly income from the royalties 
such reserves will be deposited in noninterest bearing accounts  except that such contingency reserves will be placed in certificates of deposit or united states government securities maturing on the next monthly record date if the trustee or the partnership  whichever is the case  has received an opinion of counsel to the effect that such action will not jeopardize the tax treatment of the trust or partnership as a trust or partnership  respectively  and not as an association taxable as a corporation 
assuming that the trust is classified for tax purposes as a grantor trust and the partnership is classified for tax purposes as a partnership see tax considerations to owners of units federal income tax considerations tax consequences of owning units  if such reserves are established  the amounts placed in reserve will be taxable to the unit holders when received by the partnership  even though they are not distributed to unit holders at that time 
if cash contingency reserves are established and placed in interest bearing accounts as described above  the trustee will furnish reports annually to all unit holders of record on the applicable monthly record dates containing information sufficient to enable unit holders to calculate their share of taxable income on either a cash or accrual basis attributable to any interest earned on the reserves 
if at any time the cash available to the trust or the partnership is not sufficient to pay liabilities that have become due  the trustee or the partnership  respectively  may borrow funds on a secured or an unsecured basis to pay such liabilities 
except for borrowings to purchase units as described under the units possible requirement that units be divested  neither the trustee nor the partnership may borrow an amount that at the time of borrowing exceeds of the estimated revenues of the trust or the partnership  respectively  during the immediately following six monthly periods 
generally  such borrowing must be repaid before any further trust or partnership distributions  whichever is the case  can be made 
the trust agreement requires the trustee to receive all income and proceeds of the royalties and to pay all expenses  charges  liabilities and obligations of the trust 
see the units distributions and income computations 
the trustee submits reports to the unit holders as described under the units periodic reports 
the trust agreement gives the trustee only such rights and powers as are necessary and proper for the conservation and protection of the royalties and prohibits the trustee from entering into or engaging in any business or investment activity on behalf of the trust 
except as described under the units liability of unit holders  the trustee will be indemnified out of the trust assets for any liability  expense  claim  damage or other loss incurred in performing its duties  unless resulting from its negligence  bad faith or fraud 
in no event will the trustee be deemed to have acted negligently  fraudulently or in bad faith if it takes action or suffers action to be taken in good faith in reliance upon and in accordance with the advice of parties including its own employees considered to be qualified as experts on the matters submitted to them 
neither the trust  the trustee  the partnership nor the working interest owner will be entitled to indemnification from the unit holders 
to the extent not inconsistent with the trust agreement  the trustee has been relieved from certain liabilities otherwise imposed by the texas trust act  as amended by the texas trust code the texas trust code 
duration and termination of the trust the trust agreement provides that the trust will terminate in the event that the net revenues fall below million the termination threshold for two successive years 
as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices  lower production volumes and increased expenditures for the drilling of the mcdavid lands well on the jay field property  net revenues of million received by the trust in fell below the termination threshold 
therefore  if net revenues for fell below the million termination threshold  the trust would be required to terminate effective december  the trust s net revenues for the year ended december  were million and therefore the trust did not terminate on december  it should be noted that the trust s net revenues for the year ended december  were million 
as the trust s net revenues are above the termination threshold for  the trust will not terminate on december   pursuant to the trust agreement 
status of the trust the trust agreement provides that the trust will terminate in the event that the net revenues fall below million for two successive years 
unless sooner terminated  the trust will continue until such time as its net revenues cash earnings for each of two successive years are less than million per year 
net revenues are calculated as royalty revenues after administrative expenses of the trust and as if the trust had received its pro rata portion of any amounts being withheld by the working interest owners or the partnership under escrow arrangements or to make refund payments pursuant to the conveyance the trust s pro rata portion of escrowed amounts relating to the future dismantlement of platforms are included in the net revenue calculation for this purpose 
the trust may be terminated at any time by a vote of unit holders owning a majority of the units 
the trust may also be terminated at the expiration of twenty one years after the death of the last to die of all of the issue living at the date of execution of this trust agreement of john d 
rockefeller  jr  late father of the late former vice president of the united states  nelson a 
rockefeller 
upon the termination of the trust  the trustee will sell the assets of the trust for cash unless authorized by the holders of a majority of the units to sell such assets for non cash consideration consisting of personal property upon such terms as the trustee  in its sole discretion  deems to be in the best interest of the unit holders 
after paying or making provisions for all then existing liabilities of the trust  including fees of the trustee  the trustee will distribute all cash then held by it as promptly as practicable in its capacity as trustee an  if necessary  will set up reserves in the amounts the trustee deems appropriate to provide for payment of contingent liabilities 
after the termination of the trust  the trustee will continue to act as trustee for purposes of liquidating and winding up the affairs of the trust 
if any asset required to be sold has not been sold within three years after the termination of the trust  the trustee will cause the asset to be sold at public auction to the highest cash bidder 
except in connection with any proposed non cash sale as described above  no approval of the unit holders will be required or solicited in connection with the sale of the trust s assets after termination of the trust

the royalties the manner of calculating the payments attributable to the royalties is set forth in the conveyances  forms of which are on file with the securities and exchange commission and are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this annual report on form k 
the description herein of the manner of calculating those payments is qualified in its entirety by the detailed terms of the conveyances 
overriding royalties for the purposes of computing net proceeds as defined in the conveyances  the productive properties have been grouped geographically into three groups of leases  each of which has been defined as a separate property 
these groups are designated herein as the jay field  south pass  and offshore louisiana 
see the properties description of productive properties 
the overriding royalties consist of overriding royalty interests equivalent to net profits interests equal to various percentages of the net proceeds  as defined  from the production of oil  gas and other hydrocarbons from the productive properties 
net proceeds are computed on a property by property ie  lease group basis and consist of the aggregate proceeds to the working interest owner from the sale of oil  gas and other hydrocarbons from each of the productive properties gross proceeds less production costs  which include primarily a all direct costs  charges and expenses incurred by the working interest owner in exploration  production  development and other operations on the productive properties including secondary and tertiary recovery operations  including abandonment costs  b all applicable taxes  including severance  ad valorem and windfall profit taxes  but excluding income taxes  c all operating charges directly associated with the productive properties  d an allowance for costs  computed on a current basis at a rate equal to jpmorgan chase bank  na prime rate plus per annum on the average amounts by which  and for only so long as  costs and expenses for any productive property have exceeded the proceeds of production from such productive property  e amounts paid by the working interest owner as refunds of excess sales prices on previous sales  and f applicable charges for certain overhead expenses 
the working interest owner s estimates of total special costs are  for jay field   for south pass and  for offshore louisiana 
the working interest owner has escrowed  for the jay field property   for the south pass property and  for the offshore louisiana property as of december  the conveyances prohibit the working interest owner from escrowing additional funds for estimated future special costs with respect to a particular productive property once the amount escrowed exceeds of the aggregate estimated future special costs for that property 
the conveyances permit the working interest owner to release funds from any of the special costs escrows at any time if it determines in its sole discretion that there no longer exists a need for escrowing all or any portion of such funds 
however  the working interest owner is not required to do so 
the working interest owner has informed the trustee that it does not intend to release any of the excess escrowed funds at this time 
if operating and other costs exceed net revenues from a productive property for any month  the excess will be recovered by the working interest owner out of future production from such productive property prior to making further payments attributable to the royalties with respect to such productive property  but neither the trust  the trustee  the partnership  nor any unit holder will be liable for any such costs or liabilities  nor will they be obligated to return any income from the royalties received during any prior period 
however  any such excess costs or overpayment of royalties will reduce future payments of royalties 
although crude oil production from jay field has a low sulphur content  gas production from the field has a high content of sulphur which is removed prior to processing and marketing such production 
although sulphur removed as a by product is sold by the working interest owner  the removal of the sulphur is essential to the marketing of the gas produced 
for the purpose of computing net proceeds  all proceeds to the working interest owner from the sale of sulphur extracted from jay field production and all direct costs and an allocated portion of other costs associated with such extraction are excluded from the calculations 
the trust owns overriding royalties expressed as various percentages of net proceeds 
the overriding royalties with respect to jay field and south pass are equal to of the net proceeds attributable to such properties 
in years prior to  the overriding royalties were equal to percentages of net proceeds that varied from to 
the overriding royalties with respect to offshore louisiana is and has been since the inception of the trust equal to of the net proceeds attributable to such properties 
the amount of revenues attributable to the overriding royalties from any well may be increased or reduced as a result of future pooling and unitization agreements  extinguished or suspended as a result of nonconsent provisions of present or future operating agreements between the working interest owner and other working interest owners or extinguished as a result of the expiration of oil and gas leases 
since the overriding royalties were conveyed out of the working interest owner s working interests  if the working interest owner s right to revenues is adjusted  extinguished or suspended  the trust s right to revenues will also be adjusted  extinguished or suspended 
the conveyances provide that the working interest owner has the right to approve unitization and pooling arrangements without the consent of the owners of units or the trustee 
pooling and unitization refer to the joining together of separate leases  or portions thereof  in a single unit  with the owners of the interests in each separate lease sharing  depending on their interests  in the production and costs attributable to the operations of the entire unit 
since overriding royalty revenues are based upon net proceeds  determined after deducting various costs  the amount of such revenues is directly affected by numerous factors  including governmental regulation  prices received for production  increases in operating and capital costs and certain taxes and curtailment of purchases by the purchasers of production from the productive properties 
in addition  since capital expenditures are deducted for purposes of computing net proceeds  there may be substantial periods during which there will be no net proceeds from a productive property because of such capital expenditures  and therefore no overriding royalty revenues from such productive property during such period 
the amount of the revenues attributable to the overriding royalties may also decrease materially from time to time as a consequence of the occurrence of events that are risks incident to the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  cratering  fires  drilling and production difficulties  environmental pollution problems  and  with respect to offshore louisiana and south pass  risks incident to the offshore exploration for and production of oil and gas  including those related to adverse weather and seas 
although any losses or liabilities resulting from any such events would not require the trust or unit holders to repay funds previously received  they would reduce any amounts payable thereafter with respect to the overriding royalties 
fee lands royalties the fee lands royalties consist of royalty interests equal to a interest in the future gross oil  gas and other hydrocarbon production  if any  from the fee lands  unburdened by the expense of drilling  completion  development  operating and other costs incident to production 
the fee lands consist of approximately  gross acres in south louisiana  only approximately  of which were leased at december  see the properties description of the fee lands and exploration and development activities fee lands 
analysis of the working interest owner s calculation of the royalties the following schedules summarize the working interest owner s calculation of the amounts paid to the trust with respect to the trust s royalty interests for i the quarter ended december  applicable to production from july through september and ii the year ended december  applicable to production from october through september quarter ended december  south offshore jay field pass louisiana total revenues liquids     natural gas     production costs and expenses     capital expenditures     net proceeds     overriding royalties paid to the trust    fee lands royalties  royalties paid to the trust  year ended december  south offshore jay field pass louisiana total revenues liquids     natural gas     production costs and expenses     capital expenditures     net proceeds     overriding royalties paid to the trust     fee lands royalties  royalties paid to the trust  interest earned on funds escrowed for future dismantlement costs are reported as a reduction of production costs and expenses 
interest earned for the quarter and year ended december  was approximately  and  respectively 
pursuant to the terms of the trust conveyances  interest earned on the escrowed funds for any month will be calculated at an interest rate equal to percent of the median between the prime rate at the end of such month and the prime rate at the end of the preceding month 
processing fees earned are also shown as a reduction of production costs and expenses 
for the year ended december   south pass property processing fees totaled  and interest on escrow totaled  while the operating expenses totaled  netting a credit balance of the royalty income for the south pass properties has been reduced by  as a result of excess production costs arising in the jay field and south pass properties have excess production costs of  and  respectively  as of december  the units distributions and income computations distributions of available revenues to unit holders are made monthly 
each payment is made with respect to the preceding monthly period of the trust 
the trustee determines for each monthly period the monthly income amount available for distribution for such monthly period 
the monthly income amount for each monthly period is payable to unit holders of record on the monthly record date on which such monthly period ends and is distributed by the trustee as soon as practicable but not later than ten days following such monthly record date the monthly payment date 
under the terms of the trust agreement  the trustee is prohibited from investing funds received on each monthly record date pending disbursement to holders of units 
as a consequence  the trustee may hold substantial balances between the monthly record date and the monthly payment date in each month  and jpmorgan chase bank  na has the use of these balances during such periods 
promptly after receipt of the required information  and if practicable within days of the close of each year  the net taxable income of the trust for federal income tax purposes for each monthly period ending in such year will be reported by the trustee to the unit holders of record to whom the monthly income amounts were distributed 
the trustee mailed such reports to unit holders in march if  as anticipated  the unit holders are owners of interests in a grantor trust and the partnership is a partnership for federal income tax purposes  unit holders will recognize income for federal income tax purposes in the monthly period when income is recognized by the partnership 
because the partnership has converted to the accrual method of accounting as mandated by the tax reform act of the act  unit holders are required to recognize income in certain circumstances prior to receiving cash distributions 
see tax considerations to owners of units federal income tax considerations accounting for income and deductions 
transfer of units units are transferable on the records of jpmorgan chase bank  na  as transfer agent and registrar  upon the surrender of any certificate in proper form for transfer as required by jpmorgan chase bank  na  service charges are paid as an administrative expense of the trust  and no service charge is made directly to unit holders for any transfer 
until any such transfer  the trustee may treat the owner of any unit as shown by the records of the transfer agent and registrar as the owner thereof and will not be charged with notice of any claim or demand respecting such unit or the interest represented thereby by any other party 
a transfer of a unit after the monthly record date for any monthly period does not transfer to the transferee the right to the monthly income amount for such monthly period

texas law governs matters affecting title  ownership  warranty and transfer of the certificates 
periodic reports promptly after receipt of the required information from the working interest owner  and if practicable within days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each year  the trustee mails to each unit holder of record who was such on the last monthly record date in such quarter a report indicating  among other things  the distributions and revenues attributable to the trust for such quarter 
promptly after receipt of the required information  and if practicable within days after the end of the trust s fiscal year which is the calendar year  the trustee mails to each unit holder who received a monthly income amount for any monthly period ending in such year a report that shows in reasonable detail the receipts and disbursements  and  for state and federal tax purposes  the income and expenses of the trust  as well as sufficient information to permit a calculation of any depletion deduction for each monthly period or portion thereof  if any during the year 
promptly after receipt of the required information  and if practical within days following the end of each year  the trustee mails to all unit holders of record an annual report containing audited financial statements of the trust and a summary oil and gas reserve report with respect to the trust s interests in the properties 
the trustee mails to unit holders such other reports and files such returns for federal and state income tax purposes as are required to comply with applicable laws  to comply with the rules of the new york stock exchange and to permit each unit holder to calculate his share of the income and deductions of the trust

however  under the trust agreement no duty is imposed on the trustee to secure  file or disseminate information to which it is not expressly afforded access under the terms of the trust agreement or the conveyances or which it is unable to obtain with reasonable effort and expense 
under the trust agreement  the trustee has the sole responsibility for filing all periodic reports and other materials required by law  including the securities exchange act of and the rules and regulations thereunder  and by any securities exchange on which the units are listed 
the cost of preparing and filing such materials is borne by the trust 
possible requirement that units be divested the trust agreement imposes no restrictions based on nationality or other status of the persons or other entities which are eligible to hold units 
however  the trust agreement provides that a if at any time the trust or the trustee is named a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding that seeks the cancellation or forfeiture of any property constituting part of the trust corpus because of the nationality  or any other status under the laws of the united states or any political subdivision thereof  of any one or more holders of units  or b if at any time the trustee in its reasonable discretion determines that such a proceeding is threatened or likely to be asserted and the trustee has received an opinion of counsel stating that the party asserting or likely to assert the claim has a reasonable probability of succeeding  the following procedures will be applicable i the trustee may give written notice notice to each record owner of units regarding the existence of such controversy 
the notice will contain a reasonable summary of such controversy  will include materials that will permit an owner of units promptly to confirm or deny to the trustee that such owner is a person whose nationality or other status is or would be an issue in such a proceeding ineligible holder and will constitute a demand to each ineligible holder that he dispose of his units to a party not of a nationality or other status at issue in the proceeding described in the notice within days after the date of the notice 
ii if any ineligible holder fails to dispose of his units  as required by the notice  within days after the date of the notice  the trustee will have the right to purchase and will purchase  during the days following the termination of the day period specified in the notice  any unit not so transferred at a cash price equal to the closing price of the units on the largest stock exchange on which the units are then listed or  in the absence of any such listing  in the over the counter market  on the last business day prior to the expiration of the day period stated in the notice 
the procedures for any such purchase are more fully described in the trust agreement 
iii the trustee shall cancel any units acquired in accordance with the foregoing procedures  thereby increasing the proportionate interest in the trust of other holders of units 
iv the trustee may  in its sole discretion  borrow any amounts required to purchase units in accordance with the procedures described above 
such borrowings would be repaid from revenues to the trust before any subsequent distribution to unit holders would be made 
liability of unit holders the trust is intended to be an express trust created under the texas trust code 
under texas law  beneficiaries of an express trust are not personally liable for the obligations of the trust  even if the assets of the trust are insufficient to discharge its obligations 
if the trust were held not to constitute an express trust  it is possible that the holders of units would be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the trust as would general partners of a partnership 
the trustee may incur liabilities that cannot be contractually limited  such as tort liability or federal income tax liability  in the event the trust is treated as an association taxable as a corporation 
under current judicial decisions the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc is not considered to be empowered to compel refunds from overriding royalty interest owners with respect to gas price overcharges 
however  future laws  regulations or judicial decisions might permit the ferc or other governmental agencies to require such refunds by overriding royalty interest owners or to create filing  reporting or certification obligations for the trustee or the unit holders 
moreover  other parties  such as oil or gas purchasers  may be able to instigate private lawsuits or other legal action to compel refunds from overriding royalty interest owners with respect to oil or gas pricing overcharges 
the working interest owner has agreed that it will not seek to recover from the unit holders the amount of any refunds it is required to make except out of future revenues payable to the trust 
see terms and operation of the trust terms of the conveyances for a description of agreements relating to the method of handling refunds 
the trustee will be fully liable to the unit holders if the trustee incurs any liability without taking steps reasonably necessary to ensure that such liability will be satisfiable only out of the trust assets regardless of whether the assets are adequate to satisfy the liability and in no event out of amounts distributed to  or other assets owned by  unit holders 
however  the trustee will not be liable to the owners of units for state or federal income taxes or for refunds  fines  penalties or interest relating to oil or gas pricing overcharges under state or federal price controls 
the trustee will be indemnified out of the trust assets  to the extent that the trustee s actions do not constitute negligence  bad faith or fraud  or are based on good faith reliance upon an expert 
in weighing the possible exposure to liability in the event the trust were not classified as an express trust  each unit holder should consider a the passive nature of the trust assets  b the restrictions on the power of the trustee to incur liabilities on behalf of the trust and c the limited activities to be conducted by the trustee 
voting by unit holders each unit is entitled to one vote on any matter submitted to unit holders 
meetings of unit holders may be called at any time by the trustee and must be called by the trustee at the written request of unit holders owning at least of the units 
unit holders may vote in person or by proxy 
a majority of unit holders is required to constitute a quorum 
except as otherwise provided in the trust agreement  any action by the unit holders requires the concurrence of the trustee and the affirmative vote of unit holders owning a majority of the units represented at the meeting  in person or by proxy 
the trustee and the working interest owner may solicit and vote proxies 
although unit holders possess certain voting rights  their voting rights are not comparable to those of shareholders of a corporation 
for example  there is no requirement for annual meetings of unit holders or for annual or other periodic reelection of the trustee 
to date  no matter has been submitted to a vote of the unit holders 
certain state law considerations it is anticipated that the units will be treated for certain state law purposes essentially the same as other securities  that is  as interests in intangible personal property rather than as interests in real property 
however  there is a possibility that a unit holder could be treated as owning an interest in real property 
in that event  the tax  probate  devolution of title and administration laws of louisiana  florida and alabama applicable to real property may apply to the units  even if held by a person who is not a resident or domiciliary thereof 
application of such laws would make inheritance and related matters with respect to the units substantially more onerous than they would be if the units are treated as interests in intangible personal property 
in any event the ownership of units and realization of income from the royalties by a unit holder may subject such unit holder to state or local income or other taxation in the state of the unit holder s residence or domicile 
unit holders should consult their legal and tax advisors regarding the applicability of these considerations to their individual circumstances 
see tax consideration to owners of units state tax considerations 
the properties general the trustee has no responsibility relating to the operation of the productive properties or fee lands 
the information in this annual report on form k relating to the characteristics of  operations on  and sales from the productive properties and fee lands and certain other matters has been furnished to the trustee by the working interest owner 
the working interest owner is not the operator of the jay field  south pass or offshore louisiana properties 
the overriding royalties were carved out of interests primarily working interests owned by the working interest owner at the time of the creation of the trust 
references herein to net wells and acres refer to the interest of the working interest owner from which the royalties were carved in the gross wells or acres 
references to the percentage of the working interest owned by the working interest owner are references to the working interest out of which the overriding royalties were carved 
for example  a reference to a working interest in a well or lease that is included in a productive property indicates that the trust s overriding royalties burden of the working interest in the well or lease 
that working interest is also subject to landowners royalties and may be subject to other overriding royalty interests and other burdens that are considered prior to calculation of the amounts payable with respect to the overriding royalties 
since the amounts and nature of such burdens vary from lease to lease  the information presented herein regarding the working interest owner s percentage of the working interest in wells or leases cannot be used to calculate precisely the trust s interest in any particular well or lease 
in addition  a because operating and capital costs are taken into consideration in calculating the amounts payable with respect to the overriding royalties and because prices for oil and gas may vary from field to field  information regarding results of well tests or gross quantities of production from a given well cannot be used to compute the trust s interest and b because the productive properties consist of multiple leases and  in some cases  multiple fields  the interest of the working interest owner in any given well or lease may not be indicative of its interest or the trust s interest in an entire productive property 
description of productive properties certain information  as of december   regarding the productive properties is set forth in the table below 
the productive properties include leases or portions thereof owned by the working interest owner on which productive formations are located and  in certain cases  adjacent leases or portions thereof owned by the working interest owner which are either included in pooling arrangements or which are held by delay rentals 
the leases were grouped into three groups  with each constituting a separate property for purposes of computing the overriding royalties under the conveyances

description of the fee lands the fee lands originally subject to the fee lands royalties consisted of approximately  acres of undeveloped lands owned in fee by the working interest owner in south louisiana that were not subject to oil and gas leases as of the effective date of the conveyances with respect to the fee lands royalties 
the fee lands constituted a substantial portion of all of the land owned in fee by the working interest owner in south louisiana at the time of the conveyances but excluded a the working interest owner s property subject to oil and gas leases or productive lands owned by the working interest owner as of such date  b beds and bottoms of navigable waters and c certain other minor parcels of land 
the working interest owner has developed very limited portions of the fee lands  and could  but has no obligation to  elect to develop certain additional portions of the fee lands itself 
under louisiana law  mineral royalties  in general  will terminate  in the absence of production  after the lapse of ten consecutive years from the date of conveyance 
however  the production of any mineral included in the conveyances including that obtained through testing a shut in well proved to be capable of producing in paying quantities before the lapse of ten years will  except as hereinafter provided with respect to production obtained from a unit  maintain the royalties in existence for so long as such production continues without cessation  and for a period of ten years thereafter  as to all of the lands affected thereby that are contiguous to the land burdened by the royalties from which such production is obtained 
tracts of land are rendered noncontiguous by intervening tracts owned by third parties or not covered by the conveyances  including navigable bodies of water  that divide and separate the lands burdened by the royalties 
parcels of land that meet only at a corner are likewise noncontiguous 
the fee lands contain both contiguous and noncontiguous tracts 
in the case of production from a unit  the royalties will be maintained with respect to the whole of the body of land contiguous to the production so long as such production continues without cessation  and for a period of ten years thereafter  if the unit well is situated on land burdened by the royalties  but if the unit well is on land other than that burdened by the royalties  production maintains the royalties only with respect to that portion of the land included in the unit 
if all or a portion of the tract of land burdened by the royalties is included within a unit on which there already exists a shut in well capable of producing in paying quantities located on other lands within the unit  the ten year period for termination of the royalties in the absence of production would begin anew on the effective date of the order or act creating the unit  and production within the ten year period would maintain the royalties only with respect to the acreage subject to the royalties included in the unit 
a unit is an area within which all owners of mineral rights share in production there from 
it may be created by agreement or by the louisiana department of conservation 
the trust receives minimal revenues related to production from wells drilled on fee lands acreage as well as from certain units that include small portions of the lands burdened by the fee lands royalties 
since the producing wells on unitized acreage are located on property other than that burdened by the fee lands royalties  such production could serve to maintain the fee lands royalties beyond the initial ten year period only as to the lands included within said units 
consequently  most of the fee lands royalties in the original fee lands terminated in june the trust never received any revenues from the tracts as to which the fee lands royalties terminated and such termination did not affect tracts from which the trust is receiving revenues 
however  the trust will not be entitled to receive any revenues in the future from the tracts as to which the fee lands royalties terminated 
subsequent to the june termination  the fee lands consist of approximately  gross acres  approximately  acres of which were under lease as of december  oil and gas sales from the productive properties oil sales in addition to crude oil sold to third parties  crude oil from south pass is sold to an affiliate which sells it to third parties at spot prices 
for purposes of computing the payments attributable to the overriding royalties  net proceeds include the proceeds from the sales by the affiliate after deduction of applicable transportation costs 
prior to the sale of the working interest owner s mobile  alabama refinery in july  substantially all of the crude oil from the jay field was used as feedstock for said refinery 
the working interest owner treats  for internal and landowners royalty purposes  jay field crude as sold at the wellhead at the exxon posted field price 
this treatment is also utilized for purposes of computing net proceeds 
gas and liquids sales natural gas from the productive properties is sold to an affiliate  which transports the offshore gas onshore  and sells that gas to third parties at market prices under contracts typical of those prevailing in the industry 
the working interest owner generally retained the right to revenue from liquids contained in the gas sold offshore louisiana 
depending upon the prices prevailing from time to time for natural gas relative to those for gas liquids  all or a portion of such gas is processed at plants located onshore louisiana to remove the liquids 
both these liquids and the liquids available at the tailgate of the jay field processing plant are sold by an affiliate to third parties  some of which is transported by the affiliate prior to the sale 
propane and virtually all of the other liquids are sold by the affiliate at published spot prices 
natural gas is settled by the operator on a percent of proceeds basis 
for purposes of computing the payments attributable to the overriding royalties  net proceeds include the proceeds from the natural gas and liquids sales by the affiliate after deduction of applicable transportation and processing costs 
due to the state of the gas industry and the marketing strategies used by different purchasers and producers  it is not uncommon for certain working interest owners in a property to be overproduced and to have delivered more gas than such owner was entitled to sell  leaving the other working interest owners underproduced 
as a result  an imbalance may develop between the various working interest owners regarding the amount of gas to which each is entitled and the amount each actually takes and sells 
the working interest owner uses the entitlement method of recording gas production  which results in revenues being recognized on the working interest owner s share of production regardless of which party s purchaser has actually taken and paid for the gas 
the working interest owner makes distributions to the trust based upon its entitled share of production at the relevant contractual prices 
the working interest owner s actual receipts depend on the price it receives when the imbalances are reconciled  adjustments to the working interest owner s recorded revenues have been made in the past and may be made in the future 
to the extent that any such adjustments decrease the revenues recorded by the working interest owner because gas prices were lower at the time the working interest owner s gas was actually delivered than when the revenues were originally recorded  or for other reasons  future distributions to the trust would be reduced 
the laws and regulations governing the prices which the working interest owner receives from the sale of oil and gas from the productive properties and the taxes paid with respect to the production are complex  often ambiguous and subject to alteration  often with retroactive effect 
if the working interest owner does not properly interpret the applicable law or regulations in a manner consistent with later determinations and interpretations of regulatory authorities or of the courts  the working interest owner may be required to refund amounts previously collected plus interest  which may be substantial if a long period passes between the time of the overcharge and the determination that a refund is required

exploration and development activities productive properties the following is a summary of the working interest owner s net drilling activities on the productive properties for the years ended december   and net wells oil gas dry exploratory development exploratory development exploratory development the following are the significant activities by the working interest owner on the productive properties during jay field capital and abandonment expenditures of approximately million were incurred in  primarily for nitrogen purchases for injections and an active capital workover and abandonment program 
south pass capital and abandonment expenditures of approximately  were incurred in  primarily for platform facility work and a platform abandonment 
offshore louisiana capital and abandonment expenditures of approximately  were incurred in  primarily for platform facility work 
fee lands approximately  acres of the south louisiana fee lands subject to the trust s royalty interest were under lease as of december  two wells were drilled on the fee lands in estimates of petroleum engineers september  estimates estimates of the proved oil and gas reserves and estimates of the future net revenues from the proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the properties as of september  have been made by miller and lents  ltd 
miller and lents 
based on such estimates  miller and lents has also calculated the present value of the estimated future net revenues to the trust and the imputed reserves attributable to the trust as of september  a copy of miller and lents letter  dated march   setting forth such estimates is reproduced below 
as explained in the letter  the estimates of future net revenues from proved reserves and the present value of such future net revenues were calculated based on criteria prescribed by the securities and exchange commission the sec and were based upon prices and costs represented by the working interest owner to be in effect as of september   the present value was based on a discount factor of per year 
according to the miller and lents letter  the estimated future net revenues to the trust from total proved reserves as of september  were approximately million  and the present value of such future net revenues was approximately million 
the estimates as of september   were million and million  respectively  before giving effect to approximately million in distributions during the estimates of future net revenues as of september  reflect a percent increase in future net revenues  and an percent increase in the present value of future net revenues from those estimated as of september   after adjusting those estimates for the estimated distributions related to the twelve months of production ended september  the increase in estimated future net revenues attributable to the trust from the estimates was primarily attributable to jay field  where this estimate increased by approximately million 
certain factors affecting estimates because the royalties on the properties other than the fee lands are net overriding royalty interests often referred to as net profits interests  estimates of future net revenues to the trust are affected by a number of factors in addition to the engineering  well performance and other data taken into consideration by petroleum engineers in estimating the quantity and nature of gross oil and gas reserves in the ground 
such other factors include oil and gas prices the changes in which have materially affected the estimates of future net revenues to the trust in recent years  projections of operating and capital costs  and the working interest owner s evaluation of the economic feasibility of conducting additional operations 
decreases in the price estimates used in the preparation of the miller and lents report would decrease the estimates of the reserves as well as the estimates of the future net revenues to the trust and of the discounted value of those future net revenues  and these decreases could be significant 
as indicated above  estimates of future net revenues attributable to the trust are based in part on estimates of quantities of proved oil and gas reserves to be produced in the future 
it should be emphasized that there can be no assurance that the quantities of oil and gas classified as proved reserves will ultimately be recovered 
because estimating proved reserves is not an exact science  the potential for significant revisions  either upward or downward  in estimates of proved reserves is high 
such revisions have occurred in the past with respect to the productive properties and  with respect to certain productive properties  have been material in relation to the reserves assigned to such productive properties 
reserve estimates are based on many judgmental factors  and the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data and reservoir engineering data as well as the skill and judgment of the petroleum engineer in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves involves continual revisions of estimates usually on an annual basis as additional information is made available through drilling  testing  reservoir studies and acquiring historical pressure and production data 
when a new reservoir is discovered  proved reserves are determined primarily by volumetric analysis  using limited reservoir data porosity  net pay thickness  water saturation  permeability and estimated extent of the productive area indicated by the discovery well to estimate reserves over an underground area that may cover many acres 
as a well is produced and the reservoir pressure declines  production volumes hydrocarbons and water and other factors are generally monitored and recorded so that the proved reserves can be periodically reestimated following sufficient intervals of production history 
in addition  the drilling of development wells can provide additional reservoir data  including information regarding the areal extent of the reservoir 
as reservoir history is accumulated  the historical information is incorporated into volumetric calculations or extrapolated production performance plots to refine the reserve estimate 
consequently  the accuracy of the reserve estimate generally improves with additional production history 
estimates of both the volume of  and future net revenues from  any specified reserves are of necessity based on assumptions with respect to anticipated market demand and prices obtainable for production from the particular reservoir and with respect to the costs and expenses incurred in developing and producing those reserves 
a decline in price will reduce the estimated future revenues to the trust 
a reduction in volume of sales from those estimated  as a result of curtailments or otherwise  delays the receipt of revenues and reduces the present value of future net revenues from the property 
similarly  changes in the timing and amounts of future capital expenditures can also affect the revenues and the present value 
consequently  reserve  net revenue and present value estimates made in the future may differ materially from those contained herein as a result of conditions in the oil and gas industry and general economic conditions 
the independent engineers estimated net revenues have been determined on the basis of when the oil or gas is estimated to be produced 
however  the payments with respect to the royalties are received by the trustee approximately days after the end of the month in which the sales of oil and gas are recorded as revenues by the working interest owner  and the distribution of income from the royalties to holders of units net of trust expenses occurs approximately days after the end of such month 
the estimated net revenues in miller and lents letter have not been reduced for costs and expenses of the trust  which are expected to be approximately  for the twelve months ending september  the costs and expenses of the trust may increase or decrease in future years  depending on the amount of revenues from the royalties  increases or decreases in accounting  engineering  legal and other professional fees and other factors 
in estimating future net revenues to the trust  miller and lents has only considered capital expenditures associated with the production and development of estimated proved reserves 
based on that assumption  as of september   the working interest owner has estimated the capital expenditures for production and development of only the proved reserves would be approximately million for the period from october  through september  no assurance can be given that the level of capital expenditures included in this estimate will result in the discovery of additional reserves or the successful development of reserves now classified as proved undeveloped 
amounts of future net revenues estimated for any given period do not take into account the possible effect of current or possible future market conditions relating to the price of oil and gas and other factors discussed below 
in making its estimates  miller and lents used price and cost assumptions as described in the miller and lents letter 
these assumptions are assumptions only  and there can be no assurance that actual prices and costs in the future will not be materially different from those assumed 
prices of oil and gas and related costs have varied dramatically in recent years and are impossible to predict with certainty 
as a result  and because of other inherent uncertainties in estimating oil and gas reserves and in forecasting production levels  prices and costs  neither the trustee nor miller and lents nor the working interest owner can predict what actual revenues to the trust will be in the future 
see industry conditions and regulation 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the trust is required to include as supplementary information estimates which are unaudited of quantities of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the trust 
the miller and lents letter includes such estimates  prepared on the basis described therein 
the quantities imputed to the trust are calculated by multiplying miller and lents estimated net reserves of the working interest owner prior to taking into consideration the trust s interests by the ratio of miller and lents estimated future net revenues to the trust to miller and lents estimated future gross revenues to the working interest owner prior to taking into consideration the trust s interests 
because the quantities are calculated in this manner  factors other than gross oil and gas reserves in the ground such as changes in prices and costs  excesses of capital expenditures over amounts used in preparing estimates  as described in the preceding paragraphs  and other factors will affect the quantities shown as estimated oil and gas reserves imputed to the trust

for the purposes of computing the future net revenues to the trust  the working interest properties have been combined geographically into three groups of leases designated as the jay field  south pass  and offshore louisiana 
the fort worth basin group was sold prior to september  and is not included in this report

excess production costs to the company s working interest to be recovered from future net proceeds as of september   were  for south pass field and  for jay field 
the estimated future net revenues have been estimated  pursuant to the methods prescribed by the securities and exchange commission  by applying the product prices for oil  gas  condensate  and natural gas liquids as of september   to the estimated future production of these products over the economic life of the reserves and assuming continuation of current economic conditions 
surface and well equipment salvage values and well plugging and field abandonment costs have been considered in the projections computing net proceeds for all properties 
future cost estimates  if any  for the restoration of producing properties to satisfy environmental standards were not deducted from future revenues as such estimates are beyond the scope of this assignment 
the reserve estimates and production rate projections used to forecast future net revenues and imputed reserves attributable to the trust are based on geologic and engineering studies  with corresponding rate projections made consistent with current producing rates and performance of comparable wells 
where sufficient data were available  oil and gas reserves were estimated by extrapolation of established historical performance trends 
reserves for the remaining properties were estimated by volumetric calculations or by analogy to similar properties 
estimated reserves for the jay field property are forecasted based on analysis of historical production volumes and decline rates while incorporating the on going well workover and plugging abandonment program initiated in this program has improved field production 
additional capital is budgeted by the company over the next two years to continue this program with the associated production benefit included in the estimate of future production 
in addition  the operator of jay field and the company have indicated that significant capital will likely be spent over the next two years to improve tangible and intangible field facilities 
this capital is also built into the forecast of future costs associated with the company interest

butta senior vice president cab bb appendix proved reserves definitions in accordance with securities and exchange commission regulation s x proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  i 
e  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes a that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas oil and or oil water contacts  if any  and b the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data 
in the absence of information on fluid contacts  the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir 
reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an installed program in the reservoirs provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based 
estimates of proved reserves do not include the following a 
oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as indicated additional reserves 
b 
crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology  reservoir characteristics  or economic factors 
c 
crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may occur in undrilled prospects 
d 
crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may be recovered from oil shales  coal  gilsonite  and other such sources 
depending upon their status of development  proved reserves are subdivided into proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves 
proved developed oil and gas reserves proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery should be included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved 
proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled 
proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation 
under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir 
industry conditions and regulation principal trust risk factors although risk factors are described elsewhere in this form k together with specific cautionary statements  the following is a summary of the principal risks associated with an investment in units in the trust 
natural gas and oil prices fluctuate due to a number of factors  and lower prices will reduce net proceeds available to the trust and distributions to trust unit holders 
the trust s distributions are highly dependent upon the prices realized from the sale of natural gas and oil 
natural gas and oil prices can fluctuate widely on a month to month basis in response to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the trust and the working interest owners 
factors that contribute to price fluctuation include  among others political conditions worldwide  in particular political disruption  war or other armed conflicts in oil producing regions  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  the supply and price of foreign natural gas and oil  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the proximity to  and capacity of  transportation facilities  and the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures 
moreover  government regulations  such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls  can affect product prices in the long term 
lower natural gas and oil prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that is economic to produce and reduce net profits available to the trust 
the volatility of energy prices reduces the predictability of future cash distributions to unitholders 
substantially all of the natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids produced from the properties are being sold under short term or multi month contracts at market clearing prices or on the spot market 
pending litigation against a working interest owner could adversely impact cash distributions the trustee has been informed by the working interest owner that the working interest owner has been named as one of many defendants in certain lawsuits alleging the underpayment of royalties on the production of natural gas and natural gas liquids through the use of below market prices  improper deductions  improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliated companies 
plaintiffs in some of the lawsuits allege that the underpayment of royalties  among other things  resulted in false forms being filed by the working interest owner with the minerals management service  thereby violating the civil false claims act 
if the plaintiffs are successful in the matters described above  revenues to the trust could decrease 
a judgment or settlement could entitle the working interest owner to reimbursements for past periods attributable to properties covered by the trust s interest  which could decrease future royalty payments to the trust 
the working interest owner has informed the trustee that at this time  the working interest owner is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss or settlement allocable to the trust s interest 
increased production and development costs for the overriding royalties will result in decreased trust distributions 
production and development costs attributable to the overriding royalties are deducted in the calculation of the trust s share of net proceeds 
accordingly  higher or lower production and development costs  without concurrent increases in revenues  directly decrease or increase the amount received by the trust for the overriding royalties 
if development and production costs of the overriding royalties exceed the proceeds of production from the properties  the trust will not receive net proceeds for those properties until future proceeds from production exceed the total of the excess costs plus accrued interest during the deficit period 
development activities may not generate sufficient additional revenue to repay the costs 
trust reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate  which could cause both estimated reserves and estimated future revenues to be too high 
the value of the units of beneficial interest of the trust depends upon  among other things  the amount of reserves attributable to the overriding royalties and the estimated future value of the reserves 
estimating reserves is inherently uncertain 
ultimately  actual production  revenues and expenditures for the underlying properties will vary from estimates and those variations could be material 
petroleum engineers consider many factors and make assumptions in estimating reserves 
those factors and assumptions include historical production from the area compared with production rates from similar producing areas  the assumed effect of governmental regulation  and assumptions about future commodity prices  production and development costs  severance and excise taxes  and capital expenditures 
changes in these assumptions can materially change reserve estimates 
the reserve quantities attributable to the overriding royalties and revenues are based on estimates of reserves and revenues for the underlying properties 
the method of allocating a portion of those reserves to the trust is complicated because the trust holds an interest in the overriding royalties and does not own a specific percentage of the natural gas reserves 
operating risks for the working interest owners interests in the properties can adversely affect trust distributions 
the occurrence of drilling  production or transportation accidents and other natural disasters at any of the properties will reduce trust distributions by the amount of uninsured costs 
these occurrences include blowouts  cratering  explosives and other environmental damage that may result in personal injuries  property damage  damage to productive formations or equipment and environmental damages 
any uninsured costs would be deducted as a production cost in calculating net proceeds payable to the trust 
the operators of the working interest owner are subject to extensive governmental regulation 
oil and gas operations have been  and in the future will be  affected by federal  state and local laws and regulations and other political developments  such as price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations 
none of the trustee  the trust nor its unit holders control the operation or development of the properties and have little influence over operation or development 
neither the trustee nor the unit holders can influence or control the operation or future development of the underlying properties 
the properties are owned by independent working interest owners 
the working interest owners manage the underlying properties and handle receipt and payment of funds relating to the properties and payments to the trust for the overriding royalties 
the current working interest owners are under no obligation to continue operating the properties 
neither the trustee nor the unit holders have the right to replace an operator 
the owner of any properties may abandon any property  terminating the related overriding royalties 
the working interest owners may at any time transfer all or part of the properties to another unrelated third party 
unit holders are not entitled to vote on any transfer  and the trust will not receive any proceeds of any such transfer 
following any transfer  the properties will continue to be subject to the overriding royalties  but the net proceeds from the transferred property would be calculated separately and paid by the transferee 
the transferee would be responsible for all of the obligations relating to calculating  reporting and paying to the trust the overriding royalties on the transferred portion of the properties  and the current owner of the properties would have no continuing obligation to the trust for those properties 
the current working interest owners or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities 
this could result in termination of the overriding royalties relating to the abandoned well 
the overriding royalties can be sold and the trust can be terminated 
the trust agreement provides that the trust will terminate in the event that the net revenues fall below million for two successive years 
unless sooner terminated  the trust will continue until such time as its net revenues cash earnings for each of two successive years are less than  per year 
net revenues are calculated as royalty revenues after administrative expenses of the trust and as if the trust had received its pro rata portion of any amounts being withheld by the working interest owners or the partnership under escrow arrangements or to make refund payments pursuant to the conveyance the trust s pro rata portion of escrowed amounts relating to the future dismantlement of platforms are included in the net revenue calculation for this purpose 
the trust may be terminated at any time by a vote of unit holders owning a majority of the units 
the trust may also be terminated at the expiration of twenty one years after the death of the last to die of all of the issue living at the date of execution of this trust agreement of john d 
rockefeller  jr  late father of the late former vice president of the united states  nelson a 
rockefeller 
upon the termination of the trust  the trustee will sell the assets of the trust for cash unless authorized by the holders of a majority of the units to sell such assets for non cash consideration consisting of personal property upon such terms as the trustee  in its sole discretion  deems to be in the best interest of the unit holders 
after paying or making provisions for all then existing liabilities of the trust  including fees of the trustee  the trustee will distribute all cash then held by it as promptly as practicable in its capacity as trustee an  if necessary  will set up reserves in the amounts the trustee deems appropriate to provide for payment of contingent liabilities 
after the termination of the trust  the trustee will continue to act as trustee for purposes of liquidating and winding up the affairs of the trust 
if any asset required to be sold has not been sold within three years after the termination of the trust  the trustee will cause the asset to be sold at public auction to the highest cash bidder 
except in connection with any proposed non cash sale as described above  no approval of the unit holders will be required or solicited in connection with the sale of the trust s assets after termination of the trust 
trust assets are depleting assets and  if the working interest owners or other operators of the properties do not perform additional development projects  the assets may deplete faster than expected 
the net proceeds payable to the trust are derived from the sale of depleting assets 
accordingly  the portion of the distributions to unit holders attributable to depletion may be considered a return of capital 
the reduction in proved reserve quantities is a common measure of depletion 
future maintenance and development projects on the properties will affect the quantity of proved reserves 
the timing and size of these projects will depend on the market prices of natural gas 
if operators of the properties do not implement additional maintenance and development projects  the future rate of production decline of proved reserves may be higher than the rate currently expected by the trust 
for federal income tax purposes  depletion is reflected as a deduction  which is dependent upon the purchase price of a unit

unit holders have limited voting rights 
voting rights as a unit holder are more limited than those of stockholders of most public corporations 
for example  there is no requirement for annual meetings of unit holders or for an annual or other periodic re election of the trustee 
unlike corporations which are generally governed by boards of directors elected by their equity holders  the trust is administered by a corporate trustee in accordance with the trust indenture and other organizational documents 
the trustee has extremely limited discretion in its administration of the trust 
unit holders have limited ability to enforce the trust s rights against the current or future owners of the properties 
the trust agreement and related trust law permit the trustees and the trust to sue the working interest owners to compel them to fulfill the terms of the conveyance of the overriding royalties 
if the trustee does not take appropriate action to enforce provisions of the conveyance  the recourse of a unit holder would likely be limited to bringing a lawsuit against the trustee to compel the trustee to take specified actions 
unit holders probably would not be able to sue the working interest owners directly 
industry conditions the availability of a ready market for oil and gas depends upon numerous factors beyond the working interest owner s control  including the production of crude oil and gas by others  crude oil imports  the marketing of competitive fuels  the proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines  the availability of treatment facilities  the regulation of allowable production by governmental authorities and the regulation by the ferc and various state agencies of the transportation and marketing of natural gas transported or sold in interstate commerce 
because of the mechanics of the overriding royalties  changes in net proceeds due to any of the factors above are typically not reflected in the amounts payable to the trust until the third month after the oil and gas sales are recorded or the related costs are incurred 
regulation the production of oil and gas in the united states is affected by many state and federal regulations with respect to allowable rates of production  marketing and environmental matters 
future regulations could change allowable rates of production or the manner in which oil and gas operations may be lawfully conducted 
the working interest owner s oil and gas activities on the properties are subject to existing federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to health  safety  environmental quality and pollution control 
the working interest owner has advised the trustee that it believes that its operations and facilities are in general compliance with applicable health  safety  and environmental laws and regulations 
however  events in recent years have heightened environmental concerns about the oil and gas industry generally  and about offshore operations in particular 
oil and gas operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation  including regulations that may in certain circumstances impose absolute liability upon lessees for the cost of cleaning up pollutants and for pollution damages resulting from their operations  and that may require lessees to suspend or cease operations in affected areas 
although the working interest owner has advised the trustee that current environmental regulation has not had a material adverse effect on the working interest owner s method of operations  the effects of changes in environmental law  such as stricter environmental regulation and enforcement policies  cannot be predicted 
tax considerations to owners of units federal income tax considerations introduction the following summary discusses the federal income tax consequences attendant to the acquisition  ownership and disposition of units 
however  for the following reasons  no assurance can be given that the tax treatment described in this summary will be available 
first  administrative and judicial interpretations of recent changes in the tax law affecting these matters are nonexistent or insufficient to provide definitive guidance as to the proper tax treatment of certain items 
second  certain of the tax consequences described herein are not subject to clear resolution under present law and the existing administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 
third  the laws or regulations affecting these matters are subject to new interpretations  by the internal revenue service the service or by the courts  which could adversely affect unit holders 
because the federal income tax consequences of the acquisition  ownership and disposition of units are highly complex  this discussion is merely a summary and does not purport to provide detailed tax information to unit holders or to function as a substitute for careful tax planning and analysis 
all unit holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the effects on their personal tax situations of acquiring  owning  and disposing of units 
rulings and tax opinion regarding distribution the following information concerning the company s ruling requests to the service regarding the federal income tax consequences of the creation and distribution of units to the company s shareholders the distribution and the operation of the partnership and the trust has been provided by the company 
the company has received the following requested rulings from the service the trust will be classified as a trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation 
the trust will be characterized as a grantor trust as to the unit holders and not as a nongrantor trust a simple or complex trust 
the partnership will be classified as a partnership and not as an association taxable as a corporation 
the transfer of a unit will be considered to be the transfer of the proportionate part of the partnership interest attributable to such unit 
each unit holder will be entitled to deduct cost depletion or percentage depletion if greater than cost depletion and if otherwise allowable with respect to his pro rata interest in the royalties computed by reference to such unit holder s basis in the units 
each royalty will be considered an economic interest in oil and gas in place  and each royalty will constitute a single property within the meaning of section a of the internal revenue code the code 
each unit holder will be treated as the producer of crude oil attributable to his pro rata interest in the royalties for windfall profit tax purposes 
the steps taken to create the trust and the partnership and to distribute the units are properly viewed as a distribution of the royalties by the company to its stockholders  followed by the stockholders contribution of the royalties to the partnership in exchange for interests therein  which in turn was followed by the contribution by the stockholders of the interests in the partnership to the trust in exchange for units 
although the company requested these rulings prior to the time of the distribution  the rulings were issued after the distribution occurred 
therefore  the service could revoke the rulings if it changes its position on the matters the rulings address 
these favorable rulings are consistent with a legal opinion the company received from tax counsel prior to the distribution 
the opinion of counsel is not binding on the service or the courts  and the service may revoke its favorable rulings  as mentioned above 
if it were to do so  there can be no assurance that the position of the service would not be upheld in a judicial proceeding 
at the same time the company requested the rulings described above  the company requested a ruling to the effect that it would not recognize gain or loss upon the transfer of the royalties to the trust or upon the distribution 
the company subsequently withdrew this request 
the service had indicated to the company that  if a ruling had been issued with respect to this issue  it would have been unfavorable 
tax counsel advised the company prior to the distribution that  because of the lack of direct authority  it was unable to express an opinion on this issue 
see idc recapture income to the company on distribution 
no other rulings with respect to the distribution of the units have been requested from the service and  except as noted below  no opinion of counsel has been requested or rendered regarding any other tax consequences discussed herein 
tax consequences of owning units the federal income tax consequences of owning units depend  in large part  on i the proper classification of the trust as a trust rather than as an association taxable as a corporation  ii the classification of the partnership as a partnership rather than as an association taxable as a corporation  and iii the categorization of the trust as a grantor trust rather than as a nongrantor trust a simple or complex trust 
for purposes of this summary it has been assumed that neither the trust nor the partnership will be classified as an association taxable as a corporation and that the trust is properly categorized as a grantor trust  positions consistent with the favorable rulings received by the company from the service regarding these issues 
however  as mentioned above  because the rulings were issued after the distribution occurred  the service could revoke its favorable rulings if it changes its position regarding these matters 
the manner in which unit holders who received their units in the distribution or who acquired their units before september  have chosen to report their receipt of such units may affect the manner in which they report the receipt of income distributions from the trust 
this summary of the federal income tax treatment of income distributions from the trust is based in part on the assumption that the unit holders described above have characterized their receipt of units as a receipt of interests in a grantor trust owning cash payment rights and economic interests in oil and gas properties 
general features of grantor trust taxation 
an entity which is properly classifiable as a trust for federal income tax purposes may be treated as falling into one of three categories i a grantor trust  ii a simple trust  or iii a complex trust 
because the existence of a grantor trust is generally disregarded for federal income tax purposes  a grantor trust is not subject to tax  and its beneficiaries the owners of units in the case of the trust generally are considered for tax purposes to own the assets of the trust directly 
thus  the owners of units should be treated as owning the partnership interest which the trust holds  and each owner of a unit should be treated as a partner to the extent of such unit holder s interest in the trust in the partnership for federal income tax purposes 
treatment of partners for federal income tax purposes is discussed below 
the trustee has filed  and anticipates that it will continue to file  federal income tax returns on the basis that the trust is a grantor trust 
general features of partnership taxation 
an organization which is properly classifiable as a partnership for federal income tax purposes is not a taxable entity and incurs no federal income tax liability 
instead  each item of partnership income  gain  loss  deduction  credit  and tax preference flows through to the partners  substantially as though the partners had received or expended such item directly 
each unit holder is required to take into account in computing his federal income tax liability his distributive share of all items of partnership income  gain  loss  deduction  credit and tax preference for each taxable year of the partnership ending with or within his taxable year based on the partnership s method of accounting  without regard to the unit holder s method of accounting or whether the unit holder received or will receive any cash distributions 
consequently  it is possible that in any year a unit holder s share of the taxable income of the partnership and possibly the income tax payable by him with respect to such taxable income may exceed the cash  if any  actually distributed in such year 
see accounting for income and deductions  below 
special tax rules apply to any publicly traded partnership  ie  any partnership whose capital interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradeable on a secondary market or its substantial equivalent 
because the transfer of a unit represents a transfer of an interest in the partnership  the partnership is included in the definition of a publicly traded partnership 
a publicly traded partnership is taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes unless percent or more of its gross income is from certain qualified passive sources which include income from oil and gas activities 
because all of the partnership s income is derived from the royalties  it should not be taxed as a corporation 
tax exempt organizations are subject to tax on their unrelated business income 
tax exempt unit owners should consult their tax advisors to determine if they are subject to tax on net income attributable to units in the trust 
depletion deductions 
the owner of an economic interest in producing oil and gas properties is entitled to deduct  on his federal income tax return  an allowance for the greater of cost depletion or if otherwise allowable percentage depletion on each such property 
each unit owner who acquires units by purchase should be entitled  by reason of the partnership s election under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  to deduct cost depletion or  if greater and otherwise available  percentage depletion with respect to production from each of the royalties using his basis in such royalties 
the amount of deductions based on cost depletion cannot exceed the total adjusted tax basis of the property 
prior to the enactment of the revenue reconciliation act of the act  only cost depletion was allowed to a unit holder with respect to production attributable to the royalties carved out of properties which become proven prior to this acquisition of units 
under the provisions of the act  unit holders acquiring their units after october   may be entitled to deduct an allowance for percentage depletion if such deduction would otherwise exceed the allowable deduction for cost depletion  regardless of whether the oil and gas interest was proven at the time of its acquisition 
however  in order to take percentage depletion  the unit holder must qualify for the independent producer exemption contained in section a c of the code  otherwise  such owner will be limited to cost depletion 
cost depletion for each productive property is calculated by i dividing the adjusted tax basis of the productive property by the total number of units of production barrels of oil and thousand cubic feet mcf of gas remaining attributable to the productive property held by the trust as of the taxable year and ii multiplying the result in i by the number of units sold during the year 
section of the code provides that for property placed in service by a taxpayer after december   depletion deductions which reduce the adjusted basis of such property must be recaptured as ordinary income upon a disposition of the property 
the amount of such recapture is generally limited to the amount of gain recognized by the taxpayer on such disposition 
no oil and gas properties were placed in service by the partnership subsequent to however  it is unclear whether this recapture provision applies to any portion of the depletion deduction claimed with respect to the royalties in the case of units acquired after december  the service has not issued any regulations or other pronouncements to indicate its interpretation of these recapture provisions as they affect the transfer of partnership interests 
the foregoing discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis of the complex legislation and regulations relating to the availability and calculation of the depletion deduction for oil and gas properties 
unit holders who desire further or more specific information with respect to these matters should consult their own tax advisors 
trust administrative expenses 
for individuals  miscellaneous itemized deductions are deductible only to the extent that  in the aggregate  they exceed two percent of the unit holder s adjusted gross income 
however  section a of the code provides that deductions attributable to property held for the production of royalty income may be deducted in arriving at a taxpayer s adjusted gross income 
trust administrative expenses are incurred by the trustee on behalf of unit holders in connection with the income from the royalties flowing through the partnership and trust and  therefore  may be deducted in arriving at a unit holder s adjusted gross income 
accordingly  such deductions should not be subject to the two percent floor affecting miscellaneous itemized deductions 
classification of trust income 
a taxpayer is limited in his ability to deduct losses from passive activities against other types of income 
as a fixed investment grantor trust  the trust is prohibited from engaging in any business or other investment activity  and it cannot engage in an activity which could be considered a trade or business activity for passive activity purposes 
temporary regulations indicate that taxpayers may not treat income from mineral royalties other than royalties derived from a trade or business as earned in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
therefore  royalty income such as that generated by the trust which is not attributable to a trade or business is characterized as portfolio income rather than passive activity income under these rules 
unit holders must include trust income or loss  net of trust administrative expenses and cost depletion deductions  in their calculation of net portfolio income or loss 
because trust net income or loss is considered portfolio income or loss  it may not be used to offset a unit holder s income or losses from passive activities 
the tax laws relating to the various classifications of income and the tax consequences of these classifications are complex 
unit holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the impact of these provisions on their individual tax situations 
alternative minimum tax for corporations 
for a corporation  alternative minimum taxable income is equal to i regular taxable income of the corporation  with certain adjustments  plus ii items of tax preference 
after a corporation s alternative minimum taxable income is reduced by an exemption amount  it is then multiplied by percent  the alternative minimum tax rate  to yield the tentative alternative minimum tax 
the amount by which this tentative alternative minimum tax reduced by any alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit exceeds the regular tax is the corporation s alternative minimum tax liability 
the corporate alternative minimum tax provisions insure that corporate taxpayers pay tax equal to at least percent of their economic income above the exemption amount 
the corporate exemption amount is  less percent of the excess of alternative minimum taxable income over alternative minimum tax for noncorporate taxpayers 
a noncorporate unit holder s alternative minimum taxable income is generally equal to i his regular taxable income  with certain adjustments  plus ii items of tax preference 
after a noncorporate taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income is reduced by an exemption amount  the tentative alternative minimum tax is generally determined by multiplying this amount by percent for the first  and percent of the excess over  if a noncorporate taxpayer s income includes long term capital gain income  lower rates of tax are applicable 
the amount by which this tentative minimum tax reduced by any alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit exceeds regular tax is the noncorporate taxpayer s minimum tax liability 
for tax years beginning in  the noncorporate taxpayer s exemption amount is  in the case of joint returns or surviving spouses   in the case of unmarried individuals who are not surviving spouses   in the case of married individuals filing separate returns  and  for estates and trusts 
for married persons filing jointly or surviving spouses  the exemption amounts are reduced by percent of the amount by which their alternative minimum taxable income exceeds   for singles and  for married taxpayers filing separately  estates and trusts 
because of the complexity of the rules and regulations concerning the application of the alternative minimum tax  unit holders should consult their tax advisors to determine its impact on their tax situations 
abandonment losses 
unit holders are entitled to claim deductions for abandonment losses with respect to any royalties which are determined to be worthless and are abandoned 
each unit holder should determine the amount of his abandonment losses by reference to that amount of his adjusted basis for his units attributable to each royalty which becomes worthless 
any deductions for abandonment losses allowed to a unit holder will reduce his basis in each unit for purposes of computing gain or loss on any subsequent disposition of units 
the trustee will furnish to unit holders information which will permit computation of abandonment loss deductions  if any 
see reports  below 
no such abandonment losses have been realized since the creation of the trust 
taxation of nonresident foreign unit holders 
unit holders who are nonresident alien individuals or foreign corporations collectively  foreign taxpayers  in general  are subject to us tax at the rate of on passive income such as the gross income produced by the royalties 
in certain circumstances  the applicable tax rate may be lower as a result of tax treaties 
this tax is applied to the gross income produced by the royalties  without taking into account any deductions  such as depletion 
the trustee must withhold this tax and remit it directly to the united states treasury 
the us income including income from the trust of a foreign taxpayer engaged in a trade or business in the united states is  in general  taxable at the graduated rates applicable to individuals or corporations  if the income is effectively connected with such trade or business 
a foreign taxpayer may elect to treat income from real property  such as the royalties as effectively connected with the conduct of a united states trade or business under section or section of the code or pursuant to any similar provisions of applicable tax treaties 
a foreign taxpayer whose royalty income is effectively connected with a united states trade or business or who elects to treat it as such is entitled to claim all deductions  including depletion  with respect to such income and is exempt from the percent withholding requirement 
such exemption is claimed for a calendar year by filing  in duplicate  with the trustee  form w eci  exemption from withholding tax on income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states or a substitute statement containing the information required by income tax regulation section 
the exemption statement must be received by the trustee in advance of the royalty payment for which it is intended to apply 
a separate form w eci or substitute statement must be filed with the trustee every three years in order to effect an exemption from withholding for that year s income 
because the application of the withholding regulations will vary depending on a holder s particular circumstances  all holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the regulations to them 
generally  nonresident foreign unit holders are subject to a state income tax on income from sources within such state in the same manner as a citizen or resident of the united states 
a percent branch profits tax is imposed on the after tax profits of a us branch of a foreign corporation attributable to its income effectively connected or treated as such with a us trade or business 
an income tax treaty between the us and a foreign country may reduce or eliminate the branch profits tax only if the foreign corporation is a qualified resident of the foreign country in which it is incorporated 
under section of the code  a withholding tax is imposed on partnerships in an amount equal to the united states tax on effectively connected taxable income which is properly allocable to a foreign person under section b of the code 
the amount of withholding tax is equal to the highest rate of united states tax to which each foreign partner is subject  which is currently percent for individuals and percent for corporations 
a foreign partner s share of withholding tax paid by a partnership is treated as distributed to the foreign partner on the earlier of i the date the partnership actually pays the tax to the service or ii the last day of the partnership s tax year for which the tax is paid 
future regulations may modify the general rule described above to provide for earlier deemed distributions and reductions in basis in circumstances such as those involving mid year dispositions of partnership interests 
the service is authorized to impose penalties on a partnership for failure to satisfy withholding tax liabilities 
section c of the code allows the service to require reporting by foreign direct owners of united states real property interests 
to date no such reporting requirements have been announced by the service 
if a foreign taxpayer owns or has owned during a five year look back period more than five percent of the outstanding units  either directly or through attribution rules under section of the code  the units in the hands of such a foreign taxpayer are treated as united states real property interests 
for such a foreign taxpayer  gain or loss from the sale or exchange of units will generally be regarded as arising from the sale or exchange of property effectively connected with the conduct of a united states trade or business 
therefore  any gain or loss on the sale of units must be reported to the service and appropriate taxes paid 
section of the code generally provides for withholding at the source when a united states real property interest is acquired from a foreign taxpayer after december  in general  the amount of withholding is percent of the amount realized or the disposition by a foreign taxpayer 
an exemption from withholding applies in the case of stock regularly traded on an established securities market 
treasury regulations expand this withholding exemption to include the acquisition of an interest in a publicly traded partnership or trust 
this exemption will not apply in the case of a foreign person transferring a substantial amount of non publicly traded interests in publicly traded partnerships if the transfer is from a single transferor or related transferors in a single transaction or separate transactions that occur within three months 
foreign taxpayers that received units in the original distribution on june  must generally compute their basis in such units by reference to the adjusted basis of the corresponding individual property interest in the hands of the distributing corporation the company before the distribution  increased by i any gain recognized by the distributing corporation on the distribution and ii certain taxes paid by the distributee on such distribution 
foreign taxpayers purchasing units after the distribution should use their cost of acquisition as the initial tax basis for such units 
the federal income taxation of nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations is a highly complex matter which may be affected by many other considerations 
therefore  nonresident alien individuals or foreign corporations should consult their tax advisors as to the effects of their ownership of units 
sale of units 
generally  a unit holder will realize gain or loss on the sale or exchange of units measured by the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and his adjusted basis for such unit at the time of the sale or exchange 
subject to the recapture provisions contained in code section  gain or loss on the sale of units realized by a holder who is not a dealer with respect to such units and who held them for more than months will generally be treated as long term capital gain or loss  provided the taxpayer held the units as a capital asset 
gain constituting code section recapture will be characterized as ordinary income 
for oil and gas properties placed in service after december   the code section recapture amount will include depletion deductions which reduced the unit holder s basis in such property 
see depletion deductions above 
the sale of units should be considered  for tax purposes  as the sale of an interest in the partnership 
income allocable to such units to the date of sale will be taxable to the selling owner of units  and the purchaser of units will be taxable on income allocable to such units from the date of purchase forward 
see accounting for income and deductions  below 
certain information reporting requirements may apply to the sale of units 
see information return filing requirements  below 
the partnership has made an election under section of the code to allow each subsequent purchaser of units to take a basis in his share of the royalties which reflects his cost basis in the units as opposed to his pro rata share of the partnership s basis in the royalties for purposes of calculating deductions for depletion and abandonments with respect to such royalties 
the service has ruled that a partner must maintain a single aggregate adjusted tax basis in partnership interests acquired in multiple transactions 
upon a sale of a portion of such aggregate interest  such partner would be required to allocate his aggregate tax basis between the interest sold and the interest retained by some equitable apportionment method such as the relative fair market values of such interests on the date of sale 
it is unclear whether the ruling would apply to owners of publicly traded units of beneficial interests in a trust such as the trust which owns interests in a partnership such as the partnership 
if the ruling is applicable to the units  such process of aggregating the tax basis of all units owned by a unit holder would effectively prohibit a unit holder owning units which were purchased at different prices from controlling the timing of the recognition of the inherent gain or loss in his units by choosing which units he will sell 
a unit holder considering the subsequent purchase of additional units or the sale of units purchased in more than one block should consult his own tax advisor as to the possible consequences of this ruling 
the treasury regulations provide that a partner selling a portion of its interest in a publicly traded partnership may use its actual holding period in the sold interest if  i the ownership interest is divided into identifiable units with ascertainable holding periods  ii the selling partner can identify the portion of its partnership interest transferred  and iii the selling partner makes the required election 
a unit holder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units 
if so  the unit holder would no longer be a partner in the partnership and would likely recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
as a result the partnership s items of income and loss would not be recognized by the unit holder  and any cash distributions to the unit holder would constitute ordinary income 
the irs has announced that it is studying tax issues relating to the tax treatment of short sales of partnership interests 
reports 
the trustee will furnish to unit holders of record annual reports such as the ll e royalty trust tax information package containing certain information necessary to permit the computation of federal and state tax liabilities 
audit of partnership and trust returns 
while no federal income tax is required to be paid by organizations which are classified as partnerships or grantor trusts  partnerships and grantor trusts must file informational federal income tax returns which are subject to examination by the service 
the code provides that the tax treatment of partnership items is determined at the partnership level rather than at the partner level 
these rules  which apply to the partnership  provide in general for partnership level service audits and deficiency proceedings or claims for refund in respect of partnership items 
these rules also provide for the designation of a tax matters partner the company  in the case of the partnership  who has the power to i extend the applicable statute of limitations on assessments of tax normally three years attributable to partnership items and ii enter into settlement agreements which will bind other partners unless they specifically elect not to be bound 
under treasury regulations  the term partnership items includes  insofar as may be relevant in the case of the partnership  i the partnership s aggregate and each partner s distributive share of items of income  gain  loss  deduction or credit  ii items of the partnership which may be tax preference items under section a of the code for any partner  iii optional adjustments to the basis of partnership property pursuant to an election under section including necessary preliminary determinations  such as the determination of a transferee partner s basis in a partnership interest and iv windfall profit tax for periods when the windfall profit tax was in effect 
further  a person whose tax is indirectly determined by taking into account partnership items  such as a unit holder  is required to notify the service if he treats partnership items inconsistently with the treatment on the partnership return 
failure to notify will allow the service to assess the resulting deficiency without further proceedings  and may result in a penalty 
see other possible penalties 
each unit holder should consult a tax advisor to determine the effects of the applicability of these rules to the partnership 
accounting for income and deductions 
since the partnership has utilized the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes 
the accrual method of accounting requires a taxpayer to recognize income at the earlier of the time the income is received or all events have occurred which fix the right to receive such income and the amount thereof can be determined with reasonable accuracy 
deductions are allowable for the taxable year in which all the events have occurred which establish the fact of liability giving rise to such deduction and the amount thereof can be determined with reasonable accuracy 
because the trust is treated as a grantor trust with respect to each unit holder  the royalty income of the trust will be deemed to have been accrued by each unit holder on the day the partnership accrues such income under its method of accounting and not on the date cash is distributed by the partnership or the trust  regardless of a unit holder s method of accounting 
income from the trust will be taxed to each unit holder in the taxable year within which the taxable year of the partnership ends 
trust administrative expenses are costs incurred outside of the partnership and will be recognized by unit holders consistent with their method of accounting and without regard to the taxable year and or accounting method employed by the partnership or the trust 
the trust makes monthly distributions to unit holders of record on each monthly record date on which it has revenues to distribute 
because the partnership must use the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes  the trust cannot match taxable income of the partnership with cash distributions from the trust 
thus  in certain cases a unit holder may be required to report taxable income attributable to his units  but the unit holder will not receive the distribution attributable to such income 
this will be true to the extent a cash distribution from the partnership paid on any monthly record date is associated with income accrued by the partnership prior to such monthly record date 
the trust agreement and the partnership agreement provide that income and deductions of the trust and the partnership during the period ended on each monthly record date will be allocated to the unit holders of record on that monthly record date 
the code generally requires that items of partnership income and deduction be allocated among transferors and transferees of partnership interests  as well as among partners whose interests otherwise vary during a taxable period  on a daily basis 
however  the conference committee report with respect to the applicable code provision states that regulations will provide a convention permitting such allocations to be made on a monthly basis 
furthermore  relevant legislative history indicates that allocations on a reasonable basis will be permitted pending adoption of prospective regulations governing the matter 
it is uncertain whether the service will accept the allocation method used by the partnership and the trust or will require income and deductions of the partnership or the trust to be determined and allocated daily or based on some other method of proration 
if the service made such a contention  the judicial response would also be uncertain 
the trustee believes that the allocation method adopted for the trust and the partnership is reasonable and consistent with the purposes of applicable code provisions 
in the event regulations are proposed which prescribe a convention which is inconsistent with the method used by the trust and the partnership  the trustee intends to offer comments on the proposed regulations and to take other action it deems appropriate in order to attempt to persuade the service to adopt a convention which would enable the trust and the partnership to continue to use the allocation method now in use 
in the event such a convention is not provided  the service may contend that taxable income or losses should be allocated among unit holders in a different manner 
if any such contention were sustained  the unit holders respective tax liabilities would be adjusted  and some could be required to pay additional tax 
a unit holder who transfers or acquires units should consult with his tax advisor with regard to the proper reporting of income received and expenses paid by the trust or the partnership during the month in which such units are acquired or transferred 
related tax effects on unit holders 
the ownership of units may result in the federal income tax returns of a unit holder being subject to scrutiny by the service 
a unit holder s returns may be examined as a result of an audit of the trust or the partnership  and the service may make adjustments to such returns which are unrelated to the distribution and the ownership of units 
the tax classification of the trust and the partnership directly affects the reporting by the unit holders of the trust s income and distributions 
a unit holder who treats the trust as a grantor trust would pay tax attributable to the trust s portion of the partnership s income and income from other sources received or accrued depending on his method of accounting even though no cash was distributed by the trust 
if a unit holder reports income attributable to the trust in a manner that is inconsistent with the final determination of the status of the trust or the partnership  such unit holder may be liable for a deficiency including interest or may be required to file timely a claim for refund in order to obtain any overpayment of taxes 
in addition  any tax deficiency or refund claim arising out of a unit holder s reporting of trust income could increase the likelihood of an audit of such unit holder s tax return 
other possible penalties 
an owner of a security who receives income in respect of such interest must report the character and amount of such income  for federal income tax purposes  in a manner which is consistent with the federal income tax reports of the entity which was the source of the income 
the consistency requirement is deemed to be waived if the taxpayer files a statement with the service identifying the inconsistency 
because of the presence of street name investors and the possible existence of transfer record inaccuracies  holders of interests which are actively traded in the securities markets may encounter situations in which it is difficult to comply fully and accurately with the consistency requirement and other federal tax reporting requirements 
certain penalties could be assessed against a taxpayer that fails to comply with such requirements 
because of the complexity of the federal tax reporting requirements applicable to trusts such as the trust which own interests in partnerships such as the partnership and because all of the tax attributes of the royalties flow through the partnership and the trust to the unit holders  there is an increased likelihood that unit holders will violate the consistency requirement and other reporting requirements regarding their individual federal income tax returns and the information returns of the trust and the partnership 
any violations of the consistency requirements could lead to imposition of certain penalties on the unit holders or other adverse results 
furthermore  the trust or the partnership might be subject to certain penalties in connection with its furnishing of statements and information to unit holders or the government if such statements or information prove to be inaccurate due  for example  to differences between the transfer agent s records and actual ownership data 
the code provides reporting requirements designed to facilitate the transfer of information between partnerships and trusts and owners of interests therein held by nominees 
see nominee reporting requirements 
idc recapture income to the company on distribution as described in prior reports  at the time of the creation of the trust  a legal issue existed as to whether the disposition of a royalty carved out of an operating interest to which intangible drilling and development costs idc have been charged was a disposition of property for purposes of section of the code 
section requires a taxpayer to recapture idc upon the disposition of an oil and gas property 
the company took the position on its tax returns that the distribution of the royalties did not trigger section recapture 
the service subsequently audited the company s federal income tax returns for  the year in which the trust was created and in which the units were distributed  and assessed a deficiency attributable to the distribution of the units and recapture of idc under section of the code 
the company responded to this formal adjustment to its tax liability by filing a petition in the united states tax court contesting this deficiency  and in the tax court rendered an opinion favorable to the company 
the irs did not appeal the ruling of the tax court 
consequently  the tax court s opinion is now final and nonappealable 
backup withholding the code s backup withholding system applies to all reportable payments 
the rate of withholding of tax is percent of all reportable payments

accordingly  subject to the limitations discussed below  a unit holder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to all or a portion of his distributions from the trust 
the code requires a payor to withhold percent of any reportable payment if the payee fails to furnish his taxpayer identification number tin to the payor in the required manner or to establish an exemption from the requirement or if the secretary of the treasury notifies the payor that the tin furnished by the payee is incorrect 
accordingly  a unit holder may avoid backup withholding by furnishing his correct tin to the trustee of the trust 
any unit holder who does not provide his tin to the trustee should consult his tax advisor concerning the applicability of the backup withholding provisions to his distributions from the trust 
nominee reporting requirements 
the code imposes reporting requirements on nominee owners of interests in an estate  trust or partnership 
any person holding an interest in the trust as a nominee owner must furnish the trustee with specified information about the beneficial owner 
in addition  the nominee owner must forward to the beneficial owner specified information supplied by the trustee pertaining to the beneficial owner s interest 
failure to comply with these requirements may result in the imposition of penalties up to  those persons holding units for the beneficial ownership of another should consult with their tax advisors to ensure compliance with the new nominee reporting requirements

accordingly  unit holders disposing of units acquired after december  other than through a broker may be required to notify the trustee in writing of such disposition and provide the trustee with the unit holder s name  address  taxpayer identification number and the date of the disposition 
failure to so notify the trustee may subject a unit holder  as well as the trust and the partnership  to the above described penalties 
without notification from unit holders  the trust and partnership cannot comply with these reporting requirements because they have no other way of determining which units disposed of during the year were acquired by the transferring unit holder subsequent to december  state tax considerations the royalties burden properties in louisiana  florida and alabama  and the ownership of the royalties may subject unit holders to income and other taxation in such states  require the filing of returns in such states  or both

royalty income earned from property located within louisiana is considered income derived from louisiana sources for this purpose 
therefore  individual unit holders who are not residents of louisiana are subject to louisiana income tax on income from the royalties allocated to louisiana

relative to individual income tax  effective for tax years beginning after the excess itemized deduction is repealed in its entirety

this payment represents earnings from a royalty interest in bayou sauvier for approximately months of production 
also  production increased as a result of wells completed in prior years at the salt bay and bayou sauvier fields  and there was an increase in realized prices between the periods resulting in significant revenues for the fee lands 
the amount of fee lands leased as of december  was approximately  acres compared to  acres leased at december  the trustee has been informed by the working interest owner that the working interest owner has been named as one of many defendants in certain lawsuits alleging the underpayment of royalties on the production of natural gas and natural gas liquids through the use of below market prices  improper deductions  improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliated companies 
plaintiffs in some of the lawsuits allege that the underpayment of royalties  among other things  resulted in false forms being filed by the working interest owner with the minerals management service  thereby violating the civil false claims act 
if the plaintiffs are successful in the matters described above  revenues to the trust could decrease 
a judgment or settlement could entitle the working interest owner to reimbursements for past periods attributable to properties covered by the trust s interest  which could decrease future royalty payments to the trust 
the working interest owner has informed the trustee that at this time  the working interest owner is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss or settlement allocable to the trust s interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust does not engage in any operations  and does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments  either for trading purposes or for other than trading purposes 
as described in detail elsewhere herein  the trust s monthly distributions are highly dependent upon the prices realized from the sale of oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices can fluctuate widely on a month to month basis in response to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the trust and the working interest owner 
factors that contribute to price fluctuation include  among others political conditions worldwide  in particular political disruption  war or other armed conflicts in oil producing regions  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  the supply and price of foreign natural gas  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the proximity to  and capacity of  transportation facilities  and the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures 
moreover  government regulations  such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls  can affect product prices in the long term
