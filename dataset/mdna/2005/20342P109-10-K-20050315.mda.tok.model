item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition loans  for a discussion of our lending activities 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of market interest rates may have upon our net interest income nii 
changes in the nii are the result of changes in the net interest spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
we realize income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  other interest earning assets and the interest incurred on deposits 
the volumes and yields on loans  deposits and borrowings are affected by market interest rates 
as of december   of our loan portfolio was tied to adjustable rate indices 
a majority of the adjustable rate loans are tied to prime and reprice within days 
as of december   of our deposits were time deposits with a stated maturity generally one year or less and a fixed rate of interest 
as of december   of our long term debt were fixed rate with a weighted average remaining term of years 
we entered into an interest rate swap in december which effectively changes the fixed rate trust preferred to a variable rate liability with a six month adjustment period 
the gap below reflects the affects of this interest rate swap 
changes in the market level of interest rates directly and immediately affect our interest spread  and therefore profitability 
sharp and significant changes to market rates can cause the interest spread to shrink or expand significantly in the near term  principally because of the timing differences between the adjustable rate loans and the maturities and therefore repricing of the deposits and borrowings 
our asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing our assets and liabilities in a manner that balances profitability  irr and various other risks including liquidity 
alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by  reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
alco seeks to stabilize our nii by matching rate sensitive assets and liabilities through maintaining the maturity and repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels given the interest rate environment 
when the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds rate sensitive assets within specified time periods  nii generally will be negatively impacted by increasing rates and positively impacted by decreasing rates 
conversely  when the amount of rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of rate sensitive liabilities within specified time periods  net interest income will generally be positively impacted by increasing rates and negatively impacted by decreasing rates 
the speed and velocity of the repricing assets and liabilities will also contribute to the effects on our nii  as will the presence or absence of periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors 
we utilize two methods for measuring interest rate risk  gap analysis and interest income simulations 
gap analysis focuses on measuring absolute dollar amounts subject to repricing within certain periods of time  
table of contents particularly the one year maturity horizon 
interest income simulations are produced using a software model that is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of our financial instruments and incorporate market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on current volumes of applicable financial instruments 
a traditional  although analytically limited  measure of a financial institution s irr is the static gap analysis 
static gap is the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities adjusted for any off balance sheet positions which are expected to mature or reprice within a specific period 
generally  a positive gap benefits an institution during periods of rising interest rates  and a negative gap benefits an institution during periods of declining interest rates 
at december   of our deposits were comprised of certificate of deposit cd accounts  the majority of which have original terms averaging about twelve months 
the remaining  weighted average term to maturity for our cd accounts approximated four months at december  generally  our offering rates for cd accounts move directionally with the general level of short term interest rates  though the margin may vary due to competitive pressures 
in addition to the cds  the company has million in interest bearing transaction accounts savings  money markets and interest bearing checking as of december   with rates being paid between and 
while the maturities of interest bearing deposits in the following gap table imply that declines in interest rates will result in further declines in interest rates paid on deposits  interest rates cannot drop below  and there is a behavioral limit somewhere above as to how low the rates can be reduced before our customers no longer will maintain the deposit with the bank 

table of contents the following table sets forth information concerning repricing opportunities for our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the amount of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual maturities  except that adjustable rate products are included in the period in which they are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
such assets and liabilities are classified by the earlier of their maturity or repricing date 
contractual static gap position as of december  months greater than months to months greater than months to months greater than months to years thereafter total balance dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets loans receivable adjustable rate loans  gross fixed rate loans  gross investments investment securities held to maturity investment securities available for sale federal funds sold other investments total interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities deposits non interest bearing interest bearing other borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities gap analysis interest rate sensitivity gap gap as of total interest sensitive assets cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap as of total interest sensitive assets fixed rate loans and time deposits are assumed to mature on their contractual maturity date  and no assumptions have been assumed for historical prepayment experience 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from the company s assumptions non accrual loans are included as fixed rate loans with a maturity of one year or less for purposes of this table 
other borrowings reflect the effects of the interest rate swap 
static gap analysis has certain limitations 
measuring the volume of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities does not always measure the full impact on net interest income 
static gap analysis does not account for rate caps on products  dynamic changes such as increasing prepay speeds as interest rates decrease  basis risk  or the benefit of non rate funding sources 
the relationship between product rate repricing and market rate changes basis risk is not the same for all products 
the majority of our loan portfolio reprices quickly and completely following changes in market rates  while non term deposit rates in general move more slowly and usually incorporate only a fraction of the change in rates 
products categorized as non rate sensitive  such as non interest bearing demand deposits  in the static gap analysis behave like long term fixed rate funding sources 
both of these factors tend to make our behavior more asset sensitive than is indicated in the static gap analysis 
management expects to experience higher net interest income when rates increase more than basis points  the opposite of what is indicated by the static gap analysis 

table of contents interest rate shock simulations provide us with an estimate of both the dollar amount and percentage change in nii under various rate scenarios 
all assets and liabilities are normally subjected to up to basis points in increases and decreases in interest rates in basis point increments  therefore the interests rates have been simulated at  and basis points 
under each interest rate scenario  we project our net interest income 
from these results  we can then develop alternatives in dealing with the tolerance thresholds 
the following table shows the effects of changes in projected net interest income for the twelve months ending december  under the interest rate shock scenarios stated 
the table was prepared as of december   at which time prime was 
changes in rates projected net interest income change from base case change from base case dollars in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp the estimated sensitivity does not necessarily represent a company forecast and the results may not be indicative of actual changes to the company s net interest income 
these estimates are based upon a number of assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  pricing strategies on loans and deposits  replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and other assumptions 
while the assumptions used are based on current economic and local market conditions  there is no assurance as to the predictive nature of these conditions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change
