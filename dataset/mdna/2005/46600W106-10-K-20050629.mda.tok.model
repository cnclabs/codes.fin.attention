overview we are a multi market integrated semiconductor company 
our three principal product groups are power semiconductors  integrated circuits  and systems and rf power semiconductors 
our power semiconductors improve system efficiency and reliability by converting electricity at relatively high voltage and current levels into the finely regulated power required by electronic products 
we focus on the market for power semiconductors that are capable of processing greater than watts of power 
we also design  manufacture and sell integrated circuits for a variety of applications 
our analog and mixed signal integrated circuits  or ics  are principally used in telecommunications applications 
our mixed signal application specific ics  or asics  address the requirements of the medical imaging equipment and display markets 
our power management and control ics are used in conjunction with our power semiconductors 
our radio frequency  or rf  power semiconductors enable circuitry that amplifies or receives radio frequencies in wireless and other microwave communication applications  medical imaging applications and defense and space applications 
in fiscal year  united states sales represented approximately and international sales represented approximately  of our net revenues 
of our international sales  approximately were derived from sales in europe and the middle east  approximately were derived from sales in asia and approximately were derived from sales in canada and the rest of the world 
one customer  samsung sdi co  ltd  accounted for more than of our net revenues in fiscal year during the last fiscal year  we have seen a trend of increasing growth in revenues from the sale of power semiconductors  particularly those for inclusion in consumer products 
with the increasing production resulting from these and other sales of power semiconductors  we have experienced increasing economies of scale and have been able to lower our unit cost of production 
since most of our customers that manufacture consumer products are located in asia  we have seen a shift toward asia in our revenues 
our power semiconductors for the consumer products market are manufactured at external foundries 
consequently  we 
table of contents have seen an increase in the proportion of our products that are fabricated in external foundries rather than in our own facilities 
critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the reasonableness of its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we sell to distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
approximately of our revenues in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal were from distributors 
we provide our distributors with the following programs stock rotation and ship and debit 
ship and debit is a form of price protection 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment provided that we have received an executed purchase order  the price is fixed and determinable  the risk of loss has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
reserves for allowances are also recorded at the time of shipment 
our management must make estimates of potential future product returns and so called ship and debit transactions related to current period product revenue 
our management analyzes historical returns and ship and debit transactions  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
for our nonrecurring engineering  or nre  related to engineering work performed by our clare micronix division to design chip prototypes that will later be used to produce required units  customers enter into arrangements with clare micronix to perform engineering work for a fixed fee 
clare micronix records fixed fee payments during the development phase from customers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 research and development arrangements amounts offset against research and development costs totaled approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal allowance for sales returns 
we maintain an allowance for sales returns for estimated product returns by our customers 
we estimate our allowance for sales returns based on our historical return experience  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  known returns we have not received and other assumptions 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue could be materially different 
given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products  our actual returns and allowances have not fluctuated significantly from period to period to date  and our returns provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 
this allowance is included as part of the accounts receivable allowance on the balance sheet and as a reduction to gross revenues in the calculation of net revenues on the statement of operations 
allowance for stock rotation 
we also provide stock rotation to select distributors 
the rotation allows distributors to return a percentage of the previous six months sales 
in the fiscal years ended march    and approximately million   and million  respectively  of products were returned to us under the program 
this allowance is included as part of the accounts receivable allowance on the balance sheet and as a reduction to gross revenues in the calculation of net revenues on the statement of 
table of contents operations 
we establish the allowance based upon maximum allowable rotations  which is consistent with our historical experience 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other assumptions 
if we were to make different judgments of the financial condition of our customers or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
this allowance is reported on the balance sheet as part of the accounts receivable allowance and is included on the statement of operations as part of selling  general and administrative expense 
this allowance is based on historical losses and management s estimates of future losses 
allowance for ship and debit 
ship and debit is a program designed to assist distributors in meeting competitive prices in the marketplace on sales to their end customers 
ship and debit requires a request from the distributor for a pricing adjustment for a specific part for a customer sale to be shipped from the distributor s stock 
we have no obligation to accept this request 
however  it is our historical practice to allow some companies to obtain sales discounts for inventory held 
our distributors had approximately million in inventory of our products on hand at march  ship and debit authorizations may cover current and future distributor activity for a specific part for sale to the distributor s customer 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
topic  revenue recognition  at the time we record sales to the distributors  we provide an allowance for the estimated future distributor activity related to such sales since it is probable that such sales to distributors will result in ship and debit activity 
the sales allowance requirement is based on sales during the period  credits issued to distributors  distributor inventory levels  historical trends  market conditions  pricing trends we see in our direct sales activity with original equipment manufacturers and other customers  and input from sales  marketing and other key management 
we receive periodic statements regarding our products held by our distributors 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments 
we believe that they enable us to make reliable estimates of future credits under the ship and debit program 
our actual results to date have approximated our estimates 
at the time the distributor ships the part from stock  the distributor debits us for the authorized pricing adjustment 
this allowance is included as part of the accounts receivable allowance on the balance sheet and as a reduction to gross revenues in the calculation of net revenues on the statement of operations 
if competitive pricing were to decrease sharply and unexpectedly  our estimates would be insufficient  which could significantly adversely affect results 
additions to the ship and debit allowance are estimates of the amount of expected future ship and debit activity related to sales during the period and reduce revenues and gross profit in the period 
the following table sets forth the beginning and ending balances of  additions to  and deductions from  our allowance for ship and debit during the three years ended march  in thousands balance march  additions deductions balance march  additions deductions balance march  additions deductions balance march  inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
consistent with statement of accounting research bulletin  or 
table of contents arb  our accounting for inventory costing is based on the applicable expenditure incurred  directly or indirectly  in bringing the inventory to its existing condition 
such expenditures include acquisition costs  production costs and other costs incurred to bring the inventory to its use 
in accordance with statement of arb  as it is impractical to track inventory from the time of purchase to the time of sale for the purpose of specifically identifying inventory cost  our inventory is therefore valued based on a standard cost  given that the materials purchased are identical and interchangeable at various production process 
we review our standard costs on an as needed basis but in any event at least once a year  and update them as appropriate to approximate actual costs 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
the value of our inventories is dependent on our estimate of future demand as it relates to historical sales 
if our projected demand is over estimated  we may be required to reduce the valuation of our inventories below cost 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an estimated provision for excess inventory based primarily on our historical sales 
we perform an analysis of inventories and compare the sales for the preceding two years 
to the extent we have inventory in excess of the greater of two years historical sales  twice the most recent year s historical sales or backlog  we recognize a reserve for excess inventories 
however  for new products  we do not consider whether there is excess inventory until we develop sufficient sales history or experience a significant change in expected product demand based on backlog 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our write down of inventories may be materially different 
during the economic downturn of fiscal and fiscal  we built inventory beyond demand in our santa clara operation 
at the end of fiscal  excess inventory was measured by sets of related product part numbers rather than by individual product part numbers 
these sets were used because it was thought that sales of such would be representative of the sales of the individual part numbers within any such set 
the fiscal analysis resulted in a write down of million 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized that sales by sets of related product part numbers were not revealing individual part numbers that were not selling at a similar rate and so we refined the calculation to examine excess inventory by individual part number 
this resulted in an additional million write down during fiscal the fiscal charge is the result of the application of our normal policy 
excess inventory frequently remains saleable 
when excess inventory is sold  it yields a gross profit margin of up to 
sales of excess inventory have the effect of increasing the gross profit margin beyond that which would otherwise occur  because of previous write downs 
once we have written down inventory below cost  we do not write it up 
we do not physically segregate excess inventory and assign unique tracking numbers to it in our accounting systems 
consequently  we cannot isolate the sales prices of excess inventory from the sales prices of non excess inventory 
therefore  we are unable to report the amount of gross profit resulting from the sale of excess inventory or quantify the favorable impact of such gross profit on our gross profit margin 

table of contents the following table provides information on our excess inventory at cost which has been fully reserved in our financial statements  including the sale of excess inventory valued at cost in thousands balance at march  sale of excess inventory scrap of excess inventory balance of excess inventory additional accrual of excess inventory balance at march  sale of excess inventory scrap of excess inventory balance of excess inventory additional accrual of excess inventory balance at march  sale of excess inventory scrap of excess inventory balance of excess inventory additional accrual of excess inventory balance at march  the practical efficiencies of wafer fabrication require the manufacture of semiconductor wafers in minimum lot sizes 
often  when manufactured  we do not know whether or when all the semiconductors resulting from a lot of wafers will sell 
with more than  different part numbers for semiconductors  excess inventory resulting from the manufacture of some of those semiconductors will be continual and ordinary 
because the cost of storage is minimal when compared to potential value and because our products do not quickly become obsolete  we expect to hold excess inventory for potential future sale for years 
consequently  we have no set time line for the sale or scrapping of excess inventory 
in addition  in accordance with the guidance in statements and of arb  our inventory is also being written down to lower of cost or market or net realizable value 
we review our inventory listing on a quarterly basis for an indication of losses being sustained for costs that exceed selling prices less direct costs to sell 
when it is evident that our selling price is lower than current cost  the inventory is marked down accordingly 
at march   our lower of cost or market reserve was million 
furthermore  we perform an annual inventory count and periodic cycle counts for specific parts that have a high turnover 
we also periodically consider any inventory that is no longer usable and write it off as scrap 
valuation of property  plant  equipment  and intangible assets 
we regularly evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant  equipment and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts and circumstances exist indicating that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated 
we assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
if assets are determined to be recoverable  but the useful lives are shorter than originally estimated  the net book value of the assets is depreciated over the newly determined remaining useful lives 

table of contents legal contingencies 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
goodwill 
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill and  in any event  we conduct such evaluation at least annually as of december in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated implied fair value of our company by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
then  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we believe that we operate as a single business unit 
we have one reporting unit 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we determine the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  we report the excess as an impairment loss 
we believe the methodology we use in testing impairment of goodwill provides us with a reasonable basis in determining whether an impairment charge should be taken 
to date  our goodwill has not been considered to be impaired based on the results of our analysis 
income tax 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance reduces our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and potential tax exposures  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 
defined benefit plans 
we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees in foreign locations 
for financial reporting purposes  net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate for plan obligations  assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees 
our assumptions are derived from actuarial projections and actual market data 
all of these assumptions are based upon management s judgment  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact the future expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans 

table of contents recent accounting developments in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb no

the increase in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal reflects increased unit sales of power semiconductors  integrated circuits and systems and rf power semiconductors 
the largest component of the increase in revenues was a million increase in sales of power semiconductors 
the increase in the power semiconductor group was due principally to an increase of million in sales of semiconductors for the consumer products market  which also drove a shift in our product mix toward applications for the consumer products market 
revenues from the sale of integrated circuits increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal by million as a result of a general strengthening in the ic business 
the million increase in 
table of contents systems and rf power semiconductor revenues was principally related to the microwave technology acquisition  which provided million of the increase in revenues in part because it was owned for a full year during fiscal  while only about seven months during fiscal the following table sets forth the units and average selling price  or asp  and revenues for each of our product groups for fiscal and compares such revenues against those of fiscal change in units asp revenues revenues from revenues to power semiconductors integrated circuits systems and rf power semiconductors total the million increase in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal is primarily related to increased sales to traditional markets  the inclusion of revenues from acquired entities and the addition of revenues from new markets  including the plasma display panel market 
the growth in revenues includes an approximate increase in units shipped in fiscal in our traditional markets as compared to fiscal  offset in part by an approximate decrease in average selling prices across our traditional markets 
the increase in revenues from fiscal to fiscal included the impact of two acquisitions 
we acquired microwave technology in september our fiscal revenues from microwave technology were million 
we acquired clare in june in fiscal  in part because we owned clare for a full year  our revenues from clare were million greater than our revenues from clare in fiscal over the three year period  our revenues have shifted towards asia 
of our net revenues  were in asia in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in revenues from sales to asian customers is  in part  related to our increasing sales of semiconductors for inclusion in consumer products  as most of our customers for these applications are located in asia 
in each of the three fiscal years  our revenues were reduced by allowances for sales returns  stock rotations and ship and debit 
see critical accounting policies and significant management estimates elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
gross profit 
the million increase in gross profit expressed in dollars from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of increased revenues and related improvements in economies of scale in production 
of the increase in gross profit  million was caused by the increase in our sales to the consumer products market 
the acquisition of microwave technology in september resulted in a million increase in gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross profit margin increased to during fiscal as compared to in fiscal principally because of reductions in the cost to manufacture our products related to increasing economies of scale  as well as a decrease from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in the additional provision for excess inventory  combined with an increase in the sales of excess inventory 
the addition for the full period of higher margin rf power product lines from the microwave technology acquisition also favorably affected gross profit margin 
the million increase in gross profit expressed in dollars from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of increased revenues 
the acquisition of microwave technology resulted in a million increase in gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross profit margin increased to during fiscal as compared to in fiscal  principally because of the addition of higher margin rf power product lines from the microwave technology acquisition  partially offset by provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and scrap 
in addition  the fiscal gross profit margin was negatively impacted by changes in the 
table of contents product mix 
during fiscal  we commenced significant sales of semiconductors for inclusion in consumer products  which carry lower gross profit margins than our other products 
in each of the three years  our gross profit and gross profit margin were increased by the sale of excess inventory  which had previously been written down 
see critical accounting policies and significant management estimates inventories elsewhere in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
research  development and engineering 
from fiscal to fiscal  research  development and engineering expenses increased due to an increase in the number of projects underway  including projects for gallium arsenide devices and devices for the consumer products market  and microwave technology having been a part of our business for a full year  but declined as a percentage of revenues due to our revenue growth 
although we expect an increase in research  development and engineering expenses as we fund more development projects  we do not expect a material increase in such expenses when expressed as a percentage of revenues 
in fiscal as compared to fiscal  the dollar and percentage increases were due to additional funded development projects to support our growth in revenues and the microwave technology acquisition during fiscal  but declined as a percentage of revenues due to our revenue growth 
selling  general and administrative 
in fiscal  the amount spent on selling  general and administrative expenses increased principally due to an increase of million in professional fees for regulatory compliance 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal  mainly due to economies of scale and our cost control efforts 
while selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods  we do not expect a material increase in such expenses when expressed as a percentage of revenue 
in fiscal as compared to fiscal  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased  principally due to an increase in sales commissions corresponding to our growth in revenues  expenses associated with the implementation of mandated internal controls and writeoffs of  for offices vacated when we moved our clare sales function from belgium to germany 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenues from fiscal to fiscal principally as a result of our efforts to control costs  combined with the impact of our growth in revenues 
restructuring 
in june  we adopted a corporate restructuring program to reduce expenses and preserve our cash 
the restructuring mainly related to a reduction in the workforce designed to eliminate redundant positions at clare 
the restructuring charge  which consists mainly of involuntary employee separation costs of  was recorded in operating expense during fiscal the separation cost was for employees worldwide in sales and marketing  in research and development  in general and administrative and in operations functions in the united states  and in sales and marketing and in general and administrative outside the united states 
other income expense  net 
other income  net  including loss on foreign currency transactions and interest income  net  in fiscal was  as compared to other expense of million in fiscal and  in fiscal other income expense  net improved in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses and an increase in interest income  net 
other expense  net increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to reduced interest income  net 
interest income  net was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal interest income  net grew because of an increase in short term interest rates and our increasing cash balances 
interest income  net declined in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal because of reduced short term interest rates 

table of contents provision for benefit from income taxes 
in fiscal  the provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of  as compared to a benefit from income taxes reflecting an effective tax rate of in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal rate  as compared to fiscal  was primarily higher because of valuation allowances booked against deferred tax assets offset by research and development credits 
the higher valuation allowance in fiscal was based on our assessment that a portion of our foreign net operating losses would not be realizable 
the lower tax benefit rate for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to lower net operating loss carryforwards for state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   cash and cash equivalents were million  as compared to million at march  and million at march  the increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to cash generated by operations 
over the past three fiscal years  the cash generated by our operations has provided sufficient liquidity for our needs 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  the principal working capital use of cash was to fund accounts receivable 
accounts receivable increased from march  to march  by  primarily due to higher revenues 
no one customer accounted for more than of our receivables at march  our net inventory at march  increased from march  by  principally because of increased production to meet expected sales 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased from march  to march  principally because of an increase in liabilities for income taxes 
during fiscal and fiscal  working capital was principally used to fund accounts receivable in connection with the growth in revenues 
we used million in net cash for investing activities during fiscal  as compared to million used for investing activities in fiscal and million provided by investing activities in fiscal during fiscal  we spent million in capital expenditures  as compared to million in and million in we expect capital expenditures during fiscal to continue at about the same level as fiscal our fiscal use of cash for investing activities reflected the purchase of plant and equipment  while our fiscal cash flows provided by investing activities reflected the cash acquired with clare 
for  net cash used in financing activities was million  as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal and  in fiscal during the three years  we used cash from financing activities principally to pay capital lease obligations 
in addition  in fiscal we used million to purchase our common stock and  to repay our note payable to the bank 
in fiscal  the principal sources of cash from financing activities were proceeds from the exercise of stock options and from the payment of notes receivable 
in fiscal  the principal sources of cash from financing activities were proceeds from the exercise of stock options and from purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  the principal sources of cash from financing activities were proceeds from loans and from the exercise of stock options 
another potential source of liquidity is available borrowings under existing lines of credit 
at march   we had available credit aggregating million 
at march   our debt  consisting of capital lease obligations and loan payable  was million  representing of our cash and cash equivalents and of our stockholders equity 
over the past three fiscal years  satisfying our payment obligations for debt has not materially affected our ability to fund our operating needs 
at march   we maintain two defined benefit pension plans one for the united kingdom employees and one for german employees 
these plans cover most of the employees in the united kingdom and germany 
benefits are based on years of service and the employees compensation 
the company deposits funds for these plans  consistent with the requirements of local law  with investment management companies  insurance companies  trustees  and or accrues for the unfunded portion of the obligations 
see note 
table of contents pension plans of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the investment return assumptions  the underlying estimates and the expected future cash flows associated with the pension plans 
as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
since march   we have spent or committed to spend million to purchase two of our facilities 
to substantially cover the cash spent or to be spent to purchase those facilities  we have borrowed euro million  or about million  from a german bank  repayable over years 
we believe that our cash  combined with interest to be earned thereon and borrowings available under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements  including potential investments in other companies and other assets to support the strategic growth of our business  over the next twelve months 
in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses  products and technologies and we expect to use our cash to fund these types of activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  particularly in light of the recent decline in the capital markets 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
on may   we accelerated the vesting of the right to purchase  shares of our common stock pursuant to previously granted stock options

our operating results fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
large portions of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter 
our operating results 
table of contents may fluctuate significantly 
for example  in comparing fiscal to fiscal  net revenues fell by and net income fell by 
some of the factors that may affect our quarterly and annual results are the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  fluctuations in timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments  changes in the mix of products that our customers purchase  loss of key customers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  competitive pressures on selling prices  market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  fluctuations in our manufacturing yields and significant yield losses  difficulties in forecasting demand for our products and the planning and managing of inventory levels  the availability of production capacity  the amount and timing of investments in research and development  changes in our product distribution channels and the timeliness of receipt of distributor resale information  the impact of vacation schedules and holidays  largely during the second and third fiscal quarters of our fiscal year  and the amount and timing of costs associated with product returns 
as a result of these factors  many of which are difficult to control or predict  as well as the other risk factors discussed in this annual report on form k  we may experience materially adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical  and an industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results 
business conditions in the semiconductor industry may rapidly change from periods of strong demand and insufficient production to periods of weakened demand and overcapacity 
the industry is characterized by alternating periods of overcapacity and production shortages  cyclical demand for semiconductors  changes in product mix in response to changes in demand  significant price erosion  variations in manufacturing costs and yields  rapid technological change and the introduction of new products  and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
these factors could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 
our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
we are limited in our ability to reduce fixed costs quickly in response to any shortfall in revenues 
if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and 
table of contents lower gross margins 
increased competition and other factors may lead to price erosion  lower revenues and lower gross margins for us in the future 
ixys could be harmed by litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
as a general matter  the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we have been sued on occasion for purported patent infringement and are currently defending against a number of such claims 
for example  we have been sued by international rectifier for purportedly infringing some of its patents covering power mosfets 
after trial  the us district court awarded damages to international rectifier of million plus attorney fees and issued a permanent injunction against ixys  effectively barring us from selling or distributing the allegedly infringing products 
the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit vacated those rulings and remanded the litigation to the us district court for further action consistent with the opinion of the federal circuit 
the litigation is expected to continue at the us district court and could result in another damages award and injunction 
we continue to contest international rectifier s claims vigorously but the outcome of this litigation remains uncertain 
see item legal proceedings provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
additionally  in the future  we could be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of international rectifier or other third parties 
we also have certain indemnification obligations to customers and suppliers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products 
we could incur substantial costs defending ourselves and our customers and suppliers from any such claim 
infringement claims or claims for indemnification  whether or not proven to be true  could harm our business 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation  including the pending power mosfet litigation with international rectifier  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the development  manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us 
an adverse decision in the international rectifier power mosfet litigation would  and in any other infringement action could  materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
any litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of third parties  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  is costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our core business operations 
we are dependent upon the success of our customers products 
our semiconductors are incorporated into our customers products  and the demand for our semiconductors is dependent upon the demand for our customers products 
demand for our customers products may level or decline due to technological change in our customers industries  price or quality of their products or other competitive factors 
if sales of our customers products level or fall  our sales of semiconductors intended for such products will also likely level or decline 
we have recently sold more semiconductors for inclusion in consumer products than was our historical practice 
we believe that consumer products are subject to shorter product life cycles  because of technological change  consumer preferences  trendiness and other factors  than the products of many of our other customers 
in particular  in recent years we have sold semiconductors for inclusion in the plasma display panels of a small number of manufacturers 
plasma display panels are one of several technologies for visual display in television 
should competition among the various visual display technologies for television adversely affect the sales of plasma display panels  our operating results could be adversely affected 
moreover  our operating results could be adversely affected if those plasma display panel manufacturers that have selected our semiconductors for inclusion in their products are not successful in their competition against other manufacturers of plasma display panels 
our international operations expose us to material risks 
during fiscal year  our product sales by region were approximately in the united states  approximately in europe and the middle east and approximately in asia and approximately in canada and the rest of the world 
we expect revenues from foreign markets to continue to represent a 
table of contents significant portion of total revenues 
ixys maintains significant operations in germany and the united kingdom and contracts with suppliers and manufacturers in south korea  japan and elsewhere in europe and asia 
some of the risks inherent in doing business internationally are foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the laws  regulations or policies of the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products  trade restrictions  longer payment cycles  challenges in collecting accounts receivable  cultural and language differences  employment regulations  limited infrastructure in emerging markets  transportation delays  seasonal reduction in business activities  work stoppages  terrorist attack or war  and economic or political instability 
our sales of products manufactured in our lampertheim  germany facility and our costs at that facility are denominated in euros  and sales of products manufactured in our chippenham  uk facility and our costs at that facility are primarily denominated in british pounds and euros 
fluctuations in the value of the euro and the british pound against the us dollar could have a significant impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
we generally do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
if we expand our international operations or change our pricing practices to denominate prices in other foreign currencies  we could be exposed to even greater risks of currency fluctuations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do us laws regarding the manufacture and sale of our products in the us therefore  the risk of piracy of our technology and products may be greater when we manufacture or sell our products in these foreign countries 
we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could result in a material misstatement of our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our management assessed our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that five material weaknesses existed as of march  deficiencies in the number of accounting personnel trained in applying united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap  and in reporting financial information in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission  or sec  deficiencies in our over costing and valuation of inventory  deficiencies in our control over the use of spreadsheets in our operations  deficiencies in the review of the consolidation process  and inadequate segregation of duties in the purchasing cycle 

table of contents the deficiencies in the number of accounting personnel have resulted in a number of designed controls not operating properly 
the deficiencies in the number of accounting staff during the initial year of sarbanes oxley compliance placed an extra burden upon the existing division controllers and their accounting staff  which led to controls not being performed properly 
the material weakness related to the costing and valuation of inventory resulted from the incorrect calculation of inventory yields and overhead absorption  causing erroneous production variances  at our facility in lampertheim  germany  errors in capitalized variances at our facilities in chippenham  england and lampertheim  germany and errors in calculating inventory reserves in our facility in fremont  california 
the net effect of the corrections of these errors on our financial statements for the year ended march  was an increase in cost of goods sold on our statement of operations of  a decrease in inventory of  and  distributed over a number of other accounts 
the material weakness related to spreadsheets occurred when division controllers made modifications to the template spreadsheets for periodic reporting sent to them by corporate accounting personnel  and the modifications and the impact of the modifications were not identified by corporate accounting personnel when accounting information was submitted by the divisions 
as a result of these items  reported income taxes and miscellaneous other matters changed approximately  and  respectively 
in addition  the spreadsheets used to compute key financial statement items did not have adequate validation controls 
in part because a financial analyst resigned without notice  our controls relating to review of consolidations  inputs  foreign currency translations and recurring journal entries did not function properly 
as a consequence of the unexpected departure of the financial analyst  our senior financial analyst  who is responsible for our consolidation process  had to do her work as well as that of the departed financial analyst 
thus  a layer of control in the consolidation process was eliminated 
due to a lack of personnel resources  supervisory review of the senior financial analyst s work was inadequate 
as a result of these deficiencies  our auditors found differences in our reports requiring a reduction in deferred tax assets and income tax payable of approximately million and adjustments to foreign exchange totaling  these deficiencies were assessed to be a material weakness 
we have determined that a number of duties have not been segregated properly within our cycle of activities whereby we purchase and pay for goods and services 
in particular  at several of our facilities  the same individual was able to update vendor files  control purchase orders and process vendor invoices 
these deficiencies in segregation of duties constituted a material weakness 
the material weakness arises from the limited number of accounting personnel at a number of our facilities and our historical practice of only having accounting personnel perform traditional accounting functions 
existence of these or other material weaknesses in our internal control could result in a material misstatement of our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
whether or not a misstatement occurs  the existence of one or more material weaknesses could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our controls over financial reporting  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares 
based on its assessment and as set forth in the section management report included in this annual report  our management determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective 
our management further determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective 
see item a 
controls and procedures  elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our efforts to correct the deficiencies in our disclosure and internal controls have required  and will continue to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
in addition  we anticipate the costs associated with the testing and evaluation of our internal controls will be significant and material in fiscal year and may continue to be material in future fiscal years as these controls are maintained and continually evaluated and tested 

table of contents we may not be successful in our acquisitions 
we have in the past made  and may in the future make  acquisitions 
these acquisitions involve numerous risks  including diversion of management s attention during the acquisition process  disruption of our ongoing business  the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  unanticipated expenses and potential delays related to integration of an acquired business  the risk that we will be unable to develop or exploit acquired technologies  failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired company with our own  the challenges in achieving strategic objectives  cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions  the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets  the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience  difficulties in expanding our information technology systems to accommodate the acquired businesses  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  the challenges inherent in managing an increased number of employees and facilities and the need to implement appropriate policies  benefits and compliance programs  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired company  adverse effects on our relationships with suppliers  the reduction in financial stability associated with the incurrence of debt or the use of a substantial portion of our available cash  the costs associated with acquisitions  including in process r d charges and amortization expense related to intangible assets  and the integration of acquired operations  and assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire other businesses or product lines or integrate them into our operations without substantial expense  delay in implementation or other operational or financial problems 
in the normal course of business  we frequently engage in discussions with parties relating to possible acquisitions 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
further  if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction  we may not realize the expected value from such transactions 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows  and stock price could be negatively impacted 
we depend on external foundries to manufacture many of our products 
of our revenues in fiscal year  came from wafers manufactured for us by external foundries 
our dependence on external foundries may grow 
we currently have arrangements with a number of wafer 
table of contents foundries  three of which produce the wafers for power semiconductors that we purchase from external foundries 
samsung electronics s facility in kiheung  south korea is our principal external foundry 
our relationships with our external foundries do not guarantee prices  delivery or lead times  or wafer or product quantities sufficient to satisfy current or expected demand 
these foundries manufacture our products on a purchase order basis 
we provide these foundries with rolling forecasts of our production requirements  however  the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to us is limited by the foundry s available capacity 
at any given time  these foundries could choose to prioritize capacity for their own use or other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice 
if growth in demand for our products occurs  these foundries may be unable or unwilling to allocate additional capacity to our needs  thereby limiting our revenue growth 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that these foundries will allocate sufficient capacity to satisfy our requirements 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will continue to do business with these or other foundries on terms as favorable as our current terms 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers could be harmed and our revenues could be reduced or their growth limited 
moreover  even if we are able to secure additional foundry capacity  we may be required  either contractually or as a practical business matter  to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties or an adverse effect on the business relationship 
the costs related to maintaining foundry capacity could be expensive and could harm our operating results 
other risks associated with our reliance on external foundries include the lack of control over delivery schedules  the unavailability of  or delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies  limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
our requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the external foundries that manufacture our wafers and products 
we cannot be certain these external foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of our wafers and products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products is based 
these circumstances could harm our ability to deliver our products on time or increase our costs 
we may not be able to acquire additional production capacity to meet the present and future demand for our products 
the semiconductor industry has been characterized by periodic limitations on production capacity 
although we may be able to obtain the capacity necessary to meet present demand  if we are unable to increase our production capacity to meet possible future demand  some of our customers may seek other sources of supply or our future growth may be limited 
our success depends on our ability to manufacture our products efficiently 
we manufacture our products in facilities that are owned and operated by us  as well as in external wafer foundries and independent subcontract assembly facilities 
the fabrication of semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process  and a substantial percentage of wafers could be rejected or numerous die on each wafer could be nonfunctional as a result of  among other factors contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failure  or wafer breakage 

table of contents for these and other reasons  we could experience a decrease in manufacturing yields 
additionally  as we increase our manufacturing output  we may also experience a decrease in manufacturing yields 
as a result  we may not be able to cost effectively expand our production capacity in a timely manner 
our markets are subject to technological change and our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by changing technologies  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
failure to do so could cause us to lose our competitive position and seriously impact our future revenues 
products or technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies in our product markets would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within the industry 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately 
our ability to compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and non disclosure and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite these efforts  we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology  or that our competitors will not independently develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to our technology 
more specifically  we cannot assure you that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties 
nor can we assure you that  if challenged  our patents will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
we may also become subject to or initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources and could harm our financial results 
also  others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design their products around any patents that may be issued to us 
see item legal proceedings in part i of this annual report on form k 
our revenues are dependent upon our products being designed into our customers products 
many of our products are incorporated into customers products or systems at the design stage 
the value of any design win largely depends upon the customer s decision to manufacture the designed product in production quantities  the commercial success of the customer s product and the extent to which the design of the customer s electronic system also accommodates incorporation of components manufactured by our competitors 
in addition  our customers could subsequently redesign their products or systems so that they no longer require our products 
we may not achieve design wins or our design wins may not result in future revenues 

table of contents because our products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues 
the time from initiation of design to volume production of new semiconductors often takes months or longer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take nine months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which may last an additional nine months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenues  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
our backlog may not result in future revenues 
customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
as a result  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenues for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenues  could harm our results of operations 
the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive 
certain of our target markets are intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in our target markets depends on the following factors proper new product definition  product quality  reliability and performance  product features  price  timely delivery of products  breadth of product line  design and introduction of new products  market acceptance of our products and those of our customers  and technical support and service 
in addition  our competitors or customers may offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or end user or customer requirements  including products that have the potential to replace our products or provide lower cost or higher performance alternatives to our products 
the introduction of new products by our competitors or customers could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
our primary power semiconductor competitors include advanced power technology  fairchild semiconductor  fuji  infineon  international rectifier  on semiconductor  powerex  renesas technology  semikron international  stmicroelectronics  siemens and toshiba 
our ic products compete principally with those of agere systems  legerity  nec and silicon labs 
our rf power semiconductor competitors include rf micro devices and rf monolithics 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and management resources than we have 
some of these competitors may be able to sell their products at prices below which it would be profitable for us to sell our products or benefit from established customer relationships that provide them with a competitive advantage 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 

table of contents we rely on our distributors and sales representatives to sell many of our products 
a substantial majority of our products are sold to distributors and through sales representatives 
our distributors and sales representatives could reduce or discontinue sales of our products 
they may not devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect 
in addition  we depend upon the continued viability and financial resources of these distributors and sales representatives  some of which are small organizations with limited working capital 
these distributors and sales representatives  in turn  depend substantially on general economic conditions and conditions within the semiconductor industry 
we believe that our success will continue to depend upon these distributors and sales representatives 
at march   no distributor accounted for greater than of our outstanding receivables 
nonetheless  if any significant distributor or sales representative experiences financial difficulties  or otherwise becomes unable or unwilling to promote and sell our products  our business could be harmed 
our future success depends on the continued service of management and key engineering personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel  and  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of nathan zommer  phd  our president and chief executive officer  and other members of senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of our senior management or other key employees could adversely affect our business 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
there is intense competition for qualified employees in the semiconductor industry  particularly for highly skilled design  applications and test engineers 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified individuals who could leave us at any time in the future 
if we grow  we expect increased demands on our resources  and growth would likely require the addition of new management and engineering staff as well as the development of additional expertise by existing management employees 
if we lose the services of or fail to recruit key engineers or other technical and management personnel  our business could be harmed 
growth and expansion place a significant strain on our resources  including our information systems and our employee base 
presently  because of past acquisitions  we are operating a number of different information systems that are not integrated 
in part because of this  we use spreadsheets  which are prepared by individuals rather than automated systems  in our accounting 
consequently  in our accounting  we perform many manual reconciliations and other manual steps  which result in a high risk of errors 
for a further discussion of issues relating to spreadsheets  see item a controls and procedures 
if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our goals and comply with regulations  including sarbanes oxley act of  requires an effective planning and management system and process 
we will need to continue to improve existing  and implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future 
in improving our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  we would expect to periodically implement new software and other systems that will affect our internal operations regionally or globally 
the conversion process from one system to another is complex and requires  among other things  that data from the existing system be made compatible with the upgraded system 
during any transition  we could experience errors  delays and other inefficiencies  which could adversely affect our business 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  any new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain  achieve accuracy in the conversion of electronic data and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
in addition  as we add additional functionality  new problems could arise that we have not foreseen 
such problems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner provide quotes  take 
table of contents customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to our customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations  and otherwise run our business 
failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in the diversion of management s attention and resources  impact our ability to manage our business and our results of operations  cash flows  and stock price could be negatively impacted 
future growth will also require us to successfully hire  train  motivate and manage our employees 
in addition  our continued growth and the evolution of our business plan will require significant additional management  technical and administrative resources 
we may not be able to effectively manage the growth and evolution of our current business 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly to date 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholders matters provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the future market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in the event of variations in our actual or expected quarterly operating results  announcements or introductions of new products  technological innovations by our competitors or development setbacks by us  conditions in the communications and semiconductor markets  the commencement or adverse outcome of litigation  changes in analysts estimates of our performance or changes in analysts forecasts regarding our industry  competitors or customers  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions or a failure to achieve the expected benefits of an acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts  terrorist attack or war  sales of our common stock by one or more members of management  including nathan zommer  phd  our president and chief executive officer  or general economic and market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  including semiconductor companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies in our industry  and could harm the market price of our common stock 
our dependence on independent subcontractors to assemble and test our products subject us to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs 
we depend on independent subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
the majority of our products are assembled by independent subcontractors located outside of the united states 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  limited or no warranties by subcontractors or other vendors on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors  potential misappropriation of our intellectual property  and 
table of contents economic or political instability in foreign countries 
these risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
in addition  we use a limited number of subcontractors to assemble a significant portion of our products 
if one or more of these subcontractors experiences financial  operational  production or quality assurance difficulties  we could experience a reduction or interruption in supply 
although we believe alternative subcontractors are available  our operating results could temporarily suffer until we engage one or more of those alternative subcontractors 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and  therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our revenues do not meet our revenue projections 
we also typically plan our production and inventory levels based on our own expectations for customer demand 
actual customer demand  however  can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our external suppliers and foundries  we may order materials or production in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for our wafers 
we purchase the bulk of our silicon wafers from three vendors with whom we do not have long term supply agreements 
any of these suppliers could reduce or terminate our supply of wafers at any time 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks  including potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of silicon wafers and reduced control over the price  timely delivery  reliability and quality of the silicon wafers 
we cannot assure that problems will not occur in the future with suppliers 
our ability to access capital markets could be limited 
from time to time we may need to access the capital markets to obtain long term financing 
although we believe that we can continue to access the capital markets on acceptable terms and conditions  our flexibility with regard to long term financing activity could be limited by our existing capital structure  our credit ratings  and the health of the semiconductor industry 
in addition  many of the factors that affect our ability to access the capital markets  such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the current state of the economy  are outside of our control 
there can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on favorable terms 
geopolitical instability  war  terrorist attacks  terrorist threats  and government responses thereto  may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock prices 
any such event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers 
our markets currently include south korea  taiwan and israel  which are experiencing political instability 
additionally  our principal external foundry is located in south korea 
business interruptions may damage our facilities or those of our suppliers 
our operations and those of our suppliers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake and other natural disasters  as well as power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan and do not have backup generators 
our facilities in california are located near major earthquake faults and have experienced earthquakes in the past 
if any of these events 
table of contents occurs  our ability to conduct our operations could be seriously impaired  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 
we cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against general business interruptions will be adequate to cover all our losses 
we may be affected by environmental laws and regulations 
we are subject to a variety of laws  rules and regulations in the united states  england and germany related to the use  storage  handling  discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing process 
any of those regulations could require us to acquire expensive equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with them 
if we incur substantial additional expenses  product costs could significantly increase 
our failure to comply with present or future environmental laws  rules and regulations could result in fines  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
our tax liability has been in dispute from time to time 
from time to time  we have received notices of tax assessments from certain governments of countries in which we operate 
these governments or other government entities may serve future notices of assessments on us and the amounts of these assessments or our failure to favorably resolve such assessments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we face the risk of financial exposure to product liability claims alleging that the use of products that incorporate our semiconductors resulted in adverse effects 
approximately of our net revenues in fiscal year were derived from sales of products used in medical devices such as defibrillators 
product liability risks may exist even for those medical devices that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
we cannot be sure that the insurance that we maintain against product liability will be adequate to cover our losses 
any defects in our semiconductors used in these devices  or in any other product  could result in significant replacement  recall or product liability costs to us 
nathan zommer  phd owns a significant interest in our common stock 
nathan zommer  phd  our president and chief executive officer  beneficially owned  as of may   approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  dr 
zommer can exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of the board of directors 
his holdings could result in a delay of  or serve as a deterrent to  possible changes in control of ixys  which may reduce the market price of our common stock 
regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
power semiconductors with operating voltages above volts are subject to regulations intended to address the safety  reliability and quality of the products 
these regulations relate to processes  design  materials and assembly 
for example  in the united states some high voltage products are required to pass underwriters laboratory recognition for voltage isolation and fire hazard tests 
sales of power semiconductors outside of the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearances can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer than that required for us approval  and the requirements may differ 
in addition  approximately of our revenues in fiscal year were derived from the sale of products included in medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and internationally  including the us food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda and certain foreign regulatory authorities impose numerous requirements for medical device manufacturers to meet  including adherence to good manufacturing practices  or gmp  regulations and similar regulations in other countries  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
ongoing compliance with gmp and other applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections by federal and state agencies  including the fda  and by comparable agencies in other countries 

table of contents our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could prevent our products from being included in approved medical devices 
our business could also be harmed by delays in receiving or the failure to receive required approvals or clearances  the loss of previously obtained approvals or clearances or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
the anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control because the terms of any issued preferred stock could potentially prohibit our consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of our assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction  without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
our stockholders must give substantial advance notice prior to the relevant meeting to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to our stockholders at a meeting 
these notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action 
the delaware anti takeover law restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of our common stock 
the delaware statute makes it more difficult for us to be acquired without the consent of our board of directors and management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we have on occasion utilized derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we currently keep our funds in accounts and instruments that  for accounting purposes  are cash and cash equivalents and do not carry interest rate risk to the fair market value of principal 
we may  in the future  choose to place our funds in investments in high quality debt securities  potentially consisting of debt instruments of the united states or state or local governments or investment grade corporate issuers 
investments in both fixed and floating rate securities have some degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by increases in interest rates 
floating rate securities may produce less income than anticipated if interest rates fall 
as a result  changes in interest rates could cause us to incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value or may result in lower than anticipated investment income 
should we establish one  our investment portfolio would be categorized as available for sale and accordingly presented at fair value on the balance sheet 
we intend to manage our exposure to interest rate  market and credit risk in any investment portfolio with investment policies and procedures that limit such things as term  credit rating and the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in any investment portfolio 
we are also exposed to short term fluctuations in interest rates as the accounts and instruments in which we invest our cash have variable interest rates 
although an increase in interest rates would have an adverse impact on our interest expense  our cash and cash equivalents greatly exceed the balances that we borrow through lines of credit and  if necessary to limit the burden of interest expense  we could reduce our borrowing 
the impact on the fair market value of our cash equivalents and our earnings from a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates as of the end each of fiscal and would have had the effect of reducing our annual net income as of the end of each of fiscal and fiscal by an amount less 
table of contents than million 
as our cash and cash equivalents have historically been held in accounts and instruments where the principal is not subject to interest rate risk and our cash and cash equivalents greatly exceed our variable rate borrowings  this sensitivity analysis was accomplished by offsetting our variable rate borrowings against our cash and cash equivalents and then estimating the impact of a basis point reduction in interest rates on such adjusted cash balances 
revenues from our foreign subsidiaries were approximately of total revenues in fiscal year these revenues come from our german and uk subsidiaries and are primarily denominated in euros and british pounds  respectively 
our foreign subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
our principal foreign subsidiaries use their respective local currencies as their functional currency 
although we have entered into a limited number of foreign exchange forward contracts to help manage foreign currency exchange risk associated with certain of our operations  we do not generally hedge foreign currency exchange rates 
the foreign exchange forward contracts we have entered into generally have original maturities ranging from one to three months 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
we do not expect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results 
it is possible that our future financial results could be directly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the prices of our products would become more expensive in a particular foreign market if the value of the us dollar  the euro or the british pound were to rise in comparison to the local currency  which could make it more difficult to sell our products in that market 
we will continue to face foreign currency exchange risk in the future 
therefore  our financial results could be directly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
in addition  a strengthening of the us dollar  the euro or the british pound could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
also  since march   we have borrowed euro million  or about million 
changing foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the repayment of this loan 
a hypothetical adverse change in the value of the euro against the us dollar and the british pound against the us dollar would have had the effect of reducing our annual net income as of the end of each of fiscal and by an amount less than million 
because of the operation of our principal foreign units in their own functional currencies  this sensitivity analysis was undertaken by examining the net income or loss of the foreign units incorporated into our statement of operations and testing the impact of the hypothetical change in exchange rates on such income or loss 
the hypothetically derived net income or loss of the foreign units was then calculated with our statement of operations data to derive the hypothetical impact on our net income
