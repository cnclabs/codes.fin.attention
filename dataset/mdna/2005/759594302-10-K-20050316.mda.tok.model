item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion will assist you in understanding our financial position  liquidity  and results of operations 
the information below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our discussion contains both historical and forward looking information 
we assess the risks and uncertainties about our business  long term strategy  and financial condition before we make any forward looking statements  but we cannot guarantee that our assessment is accurate or that our goals and projections can or will be met 
statements concerning results of future exploration  exploitation  development  and acquisition expenditures as well as expense and reserve levels are forward looking statements 
we make assumptions about commodity prices  drilling results  production costs  administrative expenses  and interest costs that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information 
critical estimates and accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in this report using accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements 
we must make judgments  estimates  and in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives as we apply these rules and requirements 
the most critical estimate we make is the engineering estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
this estimate affects the application of the successful efforts method of accounting  the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties  and the estimate of the impairment of our oil and gas properties 
it also affects the estimated lives used to determine asset retirement obligations 
in addition  the estimates of proved oil and gas reserves are the basis for the related standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
estimated proved oil and gas reserves the evaluation of our oil and gas reserves is critical to the management of our operations and ultimately our economic success 
decisions such as whether development of a property should proceed and what technical methods are available for development are based on an evaluation of reserves 
these oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis for calculating the unit of production rates for depreciation  depletion and amortization  evaluating impairment and estimating the life of our producing oil and gas properties in our asset retirement obligations 
our proved reserves are classified as either proved developed or proved undeveloped 
proved developed reserves are those reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves include reserves expected to be recovered from new wells from undrilled proven reservoirs or from existing wells where a significant major expenditure is required for completion and production 
since a significant amount of our drilling is ongoing exploration activity  our oil and gas reserve estimates in our year end reports include significant proved undeveloped reserves because of new discoveries that are waiting for platform or pipeline facilities to be completed in order for production to commence 
these proved undeveloped reserves are subject to higher uncertainty because the estimates for the reserves do not include any production history 
we prepare and independent reserve engineers audit the estimates of our oil and gas reserves presented in this report based on guidelines promulgated under gaap and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec 
the audit of our reserves by the independent reserve engineers involves their rigorous examination of our technical evaluation and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines as well as other technical information and measurements 
our internal reservoir engineers interpret these data to determine the nature of the reservoir and ultimately the quantity of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to a specific property 
our proved reserves in this report include only quantities that we expect to recover commercially using current prices  costs  existing regulatory practices and technology 
while we are reasonably certain that the proved reserves will be produced  the timing and ultimate recovery can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and changes in projections of long term oil and gas prices 
revisions can include upward or downward changes in the previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to evaluation of already available geologic  reservoir  or production data or new geologic or reservoir data obtained 
table of contents from wells 
revisions can also include changes associated with significant changes in development strategy  oil and gas prices  or production equipment facility capacity 
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relies on these estimates of oil and gas reserves using commodity prices and costs at year end 
in our year end reserve report we used the december  west texas intermediate posted price of per barrel and a gulf coast spot market price of per mmbtu adjusted by property for energy content  quality  transportation fees  and regional price differentials 
we estimated the costs based on the prior year costs incurred for individual properties or similar properties if a particular property did not have production during the prior year 
future global economic and political events will most likely result in significant fluctuations in future oil prices 
successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies choose one of two acceptable accounting methods  successful efforts or full cost 
the most significant difference between the two methods relates to the accounting treatment of drilling costs for unsuccessful exploration wells dry holes and exploration costs 
under the successful efforts method  we recognize exploration costs and dry hole costs the primary uncertainty affecting this method as expenses when incurred and capitalize the costs of successful exploration wells as oil and gas properties 
entities that follow the full cost method capitalize all drilling and exploration costs including dry hole costs into one pool of total oil and gas property costs 
it is typical for companies that drill a significant number of exploration wells  as we do  to incur dry hole costs 
during the last three years we have drilled exploration wells  of which were considered dry holes resulting in a success ratio on exploratory wells 
it is impossible to accurately predict specific dry holes  however  based on past experience  we estimate that between and of our exploration wells and associated exploration drilling costs  will be dry holes 
because we cannot predict the timing and the magnitude of dry holes  quarterly and annual net income can vary dramatically 
the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization of capitalized costs under the successful efforts method of accounting differs from that calculation under the full cost method in that the successful efforts method requires us to calculate depreciation  depletion and amortization expense on individual properties rather than on one pool of costs 
in addition  under the successful efforts method  we assess our oil and gas properties individually for impairment compared to the assessment of one pool of costs under the full cost method 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties the application of the unit of production method of depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting is applied pursuant to the simple multiplication of units produced by the costs per unit associated with a property 
the cost per unit is calculated by dividing the total costs associated with a property by the estimated proved oil and gas reserves on that property 
the volumes or units produced and asset costs are known  and while the proved reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
the factors which create this variability are included in the discussion of estimated proved oil and gas reserves above 
impairment of oil and gas properties like depreciation  depletion and amortization  we test for impairment of our oil and gas properties based on estimates of proved reserves 
proved oil and gas properties held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we estimate the future undiscounted net cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of the carrying amounts 
initially this analysis is based on proved reserves 
however  when we believe that a property contains oil and gas reserves that do not meet the defined parameters of proved reserves  an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation 
these reserves are subject to much greater risk of ultimate recovery 
an asset would be impaired if the future undiscounted net cash flows were 
table of contents less than its carrying value 
impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
impairment analysis is performed on an ongoing basis 
in addition to using estimates of oil and gas reserve volumes in conducting impairment analysis  it is also necessary to estimate future oil and gas prices 
the impairment evaluation triggers include a significant long term decrease in current and projected prices  or reserve volumes  an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected  and historical and current negative operating losses 
although we evaluate future oil and gas prices as part of the impairment analysis  we do not view short term decreases in prices  even if significant  as impairment triggering events 
d seismic data license agreements the d seismic agreements we have entered into allow us access to  but do not give us ownership of  d seismic data 
prior to the d seismic agreement we entered into in may of  we had entered into two other significant d seismic licensing agreements 
the agreement entered into in covered approximately  blocks in the gulf of mexico and has a year term while the agreement entered into in covers approximately  blocks in the gulf of mexico and is for an indefinite term 
until the third quarter of  our accounting policy was to capitalize a discounted total of the required payments under the agreements over an assumed useful life of four years using the straight line method 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed a review of our accounting policies in relation to the contracts and determined that as of the fourth quarter  we would charge exploration expense as invoices are paid 
this change did not have a material effect on our current or prior financial statements 
in may  we entered into a d seismic licensing agreement covering an additional approximately  blocks in deeper water trends in the gulf of mexico 
the license has a term of years with an option to renew for an additional years 
an initial payment followed by a series of quarterly invoices through july is provided for in the agreement 
there are no contingent payments 
the license agreement is an executory contract under which both parties have certain ongoing rights and obligations 
if we wish to continue using the data  we are required to make the payments as invoiced and comply with certain confidentiality provisions 
the vendor s ongoing obligations include warranty and indemnity responsibilities as to intellectual property matters 
we believe that the contract provides us with termination rights and therefore under our accounting policy  we recognize the liabilities as they become due and payable within the terms of the contract 
in the event of an enforceable finding that we do not have a right of termination prior to the full contract price being due and payable  we would re assess our accounting policy with respect to this agreement 
exploratory drilling costs the costs of drilling an exploratory well are capitalized as uncompleted wells pending the determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if proved reserves are not found  these capitalized costs are charged to expense 
on the other hand  the determination that proved reserves have been found results in the continued capitalization of the drilling costs of the well and its reclassification as a well containing proved reserves 
at times  it may be determined that an exploratory well may have found hydrocarbons at the time drilling is completed  but it may not be possible to classify the reserves at that time 
in this case  we continue to capitalize the drilling costs as an uncompleted well until the earlier to occur of one year from the date drilling is completed or suspended  or the reserves are deemed to be proved 
at that time the well is either reclassified as a proved well or is considered impaired and its costs  net of any salvage value  are charged to expense 
occasionally  we may choose to salvage a portion of an unsuccessful exploratory well in order to continue exploratory drilling in an effort to reach the target geological structure formation 
in such cases  we charge only the unusable portion of the well bore to dry hole expense  and we continue to capitalize the costs associated with the salvageable portion of the well bore and add the costs to the new exploratory well 
in certain situations  the well bore may be carried for more than one year beyond the date drilling in the original well bore was suspended 
this may be due to the need to obtain  and or analyze the availability of  equipment 
table of contents or crews or other activities necessary to pursue the targeted reserves or evaluate new or reprocessed seismic and geologic data 
if  after we analyze the new information and conclude that we will not reuse the well bore or if the new exploratory well is determined to be unsuccessful after we complete drilling  we will charge the capitalized costs to dry hole expense 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses are affected by the method in which we measure and record stock based compensation expense and  to a lesser extent  assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans 
we have included a further discussion of these critical estimates and accounting policies in the following sections of this item long term strategy and business developments  liquidity and capital resources and results of operations 
our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report also have a more comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 
long term strategy and business developments our long term strategy is to increase our oil and gas reserves and production while keeping our finding and development costs and operating costs on a per mcf equivalent mcfe basis competitive with our industry peers 
we will implement this strategy through drilling exploratory and development wells from our inventory of available prospects that we have evaluated for geologic and mechanical risk and future reserve potential 
our drilling program will contain some high risk high reserve potential opportunities as well as some lower risk lower reserve potential opportunities  in order to attempt to achieve a balanced program of reserve and production growth 
success of this strategy is contingent on various risk factors  as discussed in our filings with the sec 
over the last three years  we have invested million in oil and gas properties and found bcfe of proved reserves 
the following tables reflect our results during the last three years 
increase increase decrease decrease production oil mbbls gas mmcf total mmcfe proved reserves oil mbbls gas mmcf total mmcfe operating costs per mcfe barrels of oil are converted to mcfe at the ratio of barrel of oil equals mcf of gas 

table of contents operating costs on a mcfe produced basis have increased over the past three years from to or approximately or per annum 
this is the result of rising material and labor costs experienced during a period of increasing activity in our sphere of operations 
three years for the years ended december  ended december  in thousands unproved acquisition costs proved acquisition costs exploration development asset retirement obligation total capital and exploration costs proved reserves mcfe beginning total proved reserves revisions of previous estimates extensions and discoveries reserves purchased total proved reserve additions reserves sold production ending total proved reserves the implementation of our long term strategy requires that we continually incur significant capital expenditures in order to replace current production and find and develop new oil and gas reserves 
in order to finance our capital and exploration program  we depend on cash flow from operations or bank debt and equity offerings as discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   increased by million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to a increase in production and an mcfe  or increase in oil and gas prices 
we expect our cash flow provided by operations for to increase because of higher projected production from new properties  combined with oil and gas prices consistent with and steady operating  general and administrative  interest  and financing costs per mcfe 
excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income  our cash flow from operations fluctuates primarily because of variations in oil and gas production and prices or changes in working capital accounts 
our oil and gas production will vary based on actual well performance but may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control 
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico will shut down our production for the duration of the storm s presence in the gulf  and may damage our production facilities so that we cannot produce from a particular property for an extended amount of time 
in addition  downstream activities on major pipelines in the gulf of mexico can also cause us to shut in production for various lengths of time  as was exemplified by pipeline and other infrastructure disruptions caused by hurricane ivan last september 
our realized oil and gas prices vary significantly due to world political events  supply and demand of products  production storage levels  and weather patterns 
we sell the vast majority of our production at spot market prices 
accordingly  product price volatility will affect our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate price volatility we sometimes lock in prices for some portion of our production usually less than through the use of forward sale agreements 
currently we have no such arrangements in place 
see additional discussion under commodity price risk in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents changes in our working capital accounts from to include an increase in our accounts receivable a decrease in our cash flow provided by operations due to higher oil and gas prices  increased production and increased balances due from our joint interest participants as a result of increased operating activities drilling wells and facilities construction at year end 
due to the increase in operating activities our accounts payable balance increased by million which increased our cash flow from operations 
cash flow provided by operations also decreased due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily because of an increase in prepaid drilling and facility costs 
we incurred capital and exploration expenditures totaling million during the capital expenditures included million for leasehold acquisition  million for exploration costs  million for development costs  including platform and facilities construction and million for asset retirement costs 
during the year we built and installed offshore platforms and facilities 
in addition  in we drilled exploration wells offshore and development wells offshore and had well in progress at year end 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of our long term growth strategy 
we have budgeted million for capital and exploration expenditures in our capital and exploration budget includes million for exploratory wells 
we project that we will spend million on wells in the gulf of mexico and million on onshore wells in south texas and mississippi 
the budget also includes million for platforms and development drilling 
additional development expenditures beyond the budgeted amount will be required throughout the year  the amount of such additional expenditures being dependent upon our success with our exploration and development program 
the remaining million will be allocated to leasehold acquisitions  seismic acquisitions  and workovers 
if our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to expend additional capital in order to finance the completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
if we continue at our historical success rates  the capital expenditures are estimated to be million to million 
we believe that  because of the additional reserves resulting from the exploratory success and our record of reserve growth in recent years  we will be able to access sufficient additional capital through available cash on hand and or additional bank financing and or offerings of debt or equity securities 
effective may   we agreed with our lenders to maintain our borrowing base at million 
as of december   we had nothing borrowed under the facility 
the banks review the borrowing base semi annually and  at their discretion  may decrease or propose an increase to the borrowing base relative to a re determined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit 
additionally  we have agreed not to pay dividends 
the most significant financial covenants in the line of credit include maintaining a minimum current ratio as defined in the credit agreement of to  a minimum tangible net worth of million plus of net income accumulated from the inception of the agreement and of any non redeemable preferred or common stock offerings  and interest coverage of to we are currently in compliance with these financial covenants 
if we do not comply with these covenants on a continuing basis  the lenders have the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare any outstanding principal and interest immediately due and payable 
on june   we filed a shelf registration statement to issue up to million of common stock  debt securities  preferred stock  and or warrants 
the sec declared the shelf registration statement effective december  we have not drawn on the shelf offering 
generally  the shelf is effective for two years from the effective date

results of operations in  we achieved net income totaling million or basic income per share  and diluted income per share  compared to net income of million or basic income per share and diluted income per share in the increase in net income resulted primarily from increased oil and gas production and sales prices 
in addition to oil and gas production and sales prices  certain accounting policies discussed below can cause our net income to vary significantly from period to period because of events or circumstances which trigger recognition of expenses for unsuccessful wells or impairments of properties 
further  we calculate certain expenses using estimates of oil and gas reserves that can vary significantly

during  oil sales revenue increased by million  or  compared to because oil production increased by  barrels  or  and average oil prices increased by or 
the increase in oil production came primarily from new properties in the offshore gulf of mexico partially offset by natural depletion of the existing producing properties in the gulf coast area and the sale of certain properties in south texas in april gas sales revenue during increased by million or compared to because of higher average gas prices and increased production

asset retirement obligations we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  effective january  the statement requires that we estimate the fair value for our asset retirement obligations dismantlement and abandonment of oil and gas wells and offshore platforms in the periods the assets are first placed in service 
we then adjust the current estimated obligation for estimated inflation and market risk contingencies to the projected settlement date of the liability 
the result is then discounted to a present value from the projected settlement date to the date the asset was first placed in service 
as of january   we record the present value of the asset retirement obligation as an additional property cost and as an asset retirement liability 
we recorded a combination of the amortization of the additional property cost using the unit of production method and the accretion of the discounted liability as a component of our depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties 
we base our initial liability on estimates of current costs to dismantle and abandon our existing platforms and wells on historical experience  industry practice  and external estimates of the cost to abandon similar platforms and wells subject to federal and state regulatory requirements 
we increase the current liability estimate using a annual inflation factor over the estimated productive life of the individual property and further increase the inflated liability by for market cost risk 
the liability is discounted using united states treasury securities with constant maturities that approximate the number of years of productive life for the property plus a adjustment for credit risk 
revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in estimated abandonment costs or well economic lives  or if federal or state regulators enact new requirements regarding abandonment of wells 
prior to our adoption of sfas  we accrued an estimated dismantlement  restoration and abandonment liability using the unit of production method over the life of a property and included the accrued amount in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
the total accrued liability million at december  was reflected as additional accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties on our balance sheet 
in conformity with sfas we recorded the cumulative effect of this accounting change as of january   as if we had used this method in the prior years 
at january   we increased our oil and gas properties by million  recorded million as an asset retirement obligation liability and reduced our accumulated depreciation by million million accrued dismantlement in prior years less accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on the increased property costs 
the adoption of the new standard had no material effect on our net income 
the following pro forma data summarize our net income and net income per share for the years ended december  and  as if we had adopted the provisions of sfas on january   including aggregate pro forma asset retirement obligations on that date years ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net income  as reported pro forma adjustment to reflect retroactive adoption of sfas pro forma net income net income per share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma 
table of contents impairment of oil and gas properties because we account for our proved oil and gas properties separately  we also assess our assets for impairment property by property rather than in one pool of total oil and gas property costs 
this method of assessment is another feature of the successful efforts method of accounting 
certain unforeseeable events such as significantly decreased long term oil or gas prices  failure of a well or wells to perform as projected  insufficient data on reservoir performance  and or unexpected or increased costs may cause us to record an impairment expense on a particular property 
we base our assessment of possible impairment using our best estimate of future prices  costs and expected net cash flow generated by a property 
we estimate future prices based on nymex month strips  adjusted for basis differential and escalate both the prices and the costs for inflation if appropriate 
if these estimates indicate impairment  we measure the impairment expense as the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value measured by discounting the future net cash flow from the property at an appropriate rate 
actual prices  costs  discount rates  and net cash flow may vary from our estimates 
we recognized impairment expenses during the last three years as follows for the years ended december  in thousands unproved properties proved properties total impairment expense we estimate the amount of individually insignificant unproved properties which will prove unproductive by amortizing the balance of our individual immaterial unproved property costs adjusted by an anticipated rate of future successful development over an average lease term 
individually significant properties will continue to be evaluated periodically on a separate basis for impairment 
we will transfer the original cost of an unproved property to proved properties when we find commercial oil and gas reserves sufficient to justify full development of the property 
the impairment of unproved properties for the prior two years resulted from the actual due to unsuccessful exploration results or impending forfeiture of leaseholds 
we analyze our proved properties for impairment indicators based on the proved reserves as determined by our internal reserve engineers 
the properties impaired in primarily consisted of properties in the gulf of mexico which totaled million and properties in the onshore gulf coast totaling million  and in included two properties in the gulf of mexico which totaled million and one in the onshore gulf coast which totaled  during  we impaired two proved properties in the offshore gulf of mexico that accounted for million and two proved properties in the onshore gulf coast that accounted for million 
the impairments resulted primarily from wells depleting sooner than originally estimated or capital costs in excess of those anticipated 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses during decreased by  or compared to general and administrative expenses decreased by per mcfe to in from in general and administrative expense in increased by million 
stock based compensation expense which is included in general and administrative expense totaled million in  million in and million in interest and financing expense interest and financing expense decreased during the past two years because of lower interest rates and lower outstanding debt 

table of contents income taxes during  income taxes increased by million compared to and increased by million during compared to as a result of increased income before taxes 
the effective tax rate increased slightly in due to an increase in the provision for deferred state income taxes 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r will require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in our consolidated statements of income based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july   and permits us to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date of sfas r that remain unvested on the adoption date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
we have elected to adopt the provisions of sfas r on july   using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and related interpretations 
therefore  we do not recognize compensation expenses associated with employee stock options 
currently  since all of our outstanding stock options have vested prior to the adoption of sfas r  we will not recognize any expenses associated with these prior stock option grants 
however  the adoption of sfas r fair value method could have a significant impact on our future results of operations for future stock or stock option grants but no impact on our overall financial position 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the pro forma net income and income per share disclosures in notes to consolidated financial statements  note summary of significant accounting policies stock options 
the adoption of sfas r will have no effect on our outstanding stock grant awards 
sfas r also requires the tax benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may reduce our future cash provided by operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities  to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows from such excess tax deductions was million during the year ended december

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk a vast majority of our production is sold on the spot markets 
accordingly  we are at risk for the volatility of commodity prices inherent in the oil and gas industry 
occasionally we sell forward portions of our production under physical delivery contracts that by their terms cannot be settled in cash or other financial instruments 
such contracts are not subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no
