item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial position for the periods described below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included herein 
our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
these statements are based on certain assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results may differ materially from these indicated forward looking statements 
for information about these assumptions and other risks and exposures relating to our business and our company  you should refer to the section entitled forward looking statements and risk factors which may affect future results 
restatement pursuant to sfas  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  the company has restated its segment disclosure from one reporting segment as was originally reported to three reporting segments see note 
background we generate substantially all of our revenue by providing water and wastewater residuals management services to municipal and industrial customers 
we provide our customers with services and capabilities  including  drying and pelletization  composting  product marketing  incineration  alkaline stabilization  land application  collection and transportation  regulatory compliance  dewatering  and facility cleanout services 
we currently serve more than customers in states and the district of columbia 
our contracts typically have inflation price adjustments  renewal clauses and broad force majeure provisions 
for the year ended december   we experienced a contract retention rate both renewals and rebids of approximately percent 
we categorize our revenues into five types contract  purchase order po  product sales  design build construction and event work 
contract revenues are generated primarily from land application  collection and transportation services  dewatering  incineration  composting  drying and pelletization services and facility operations and maintenance  and are typically performed under a contract with terms ranging from to years 
contract revenues accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent of total revenues in  and  respectively 
purchase order revenues are primarily from facility operations  maintenance services  and collection and transportation services where services are performed on a recurring basis  but not under a long term contract 
purchase order revenues accounted for approximately three percent  four percent and five percent of total revenues in  and  respectively 
product sales revenues are primarily generated from sales of composted and pelletized biosolids from internal and external facilities 
revenues from product sales accounted for approximately three percent of total revenues in and four percent of total revenues in and  respectively 
design build construction revenues are derived from construction projects where we agree to design and build a biosolids processing facility such as a drying and pelletization facility  composting facility  incineration facility or a dewatering facility that we will subsequently operate once the facility commences commercial operations 
revenues from design build construction projects accounted for approximately three percent  two percent and four percent of total revenues in  and respectively 
event project revenues are typically generated from digester or lagoon cleanout projects and temporary dewatering projects 
revenue from event projects accounted for approximately eight percent  six percent and six percent of total revenues in  and revenues under our facilities operations and maintenance contracts are recognized either when wastewater residuals enter the facility or when the residuals have been processed  depending on the contract terms 
all other revenues under service contracts are recognized when the service is performed 
revenues from design build construction projects are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we provide for losses in connection with long term contracts where an obligation exists to perform services and it becomes evident that the projected contract costs will exceed the related revenue 
our costs relating to service contracts include processing  transportation  spreading and disposal costs  and depreciation of operating assets 
our spreading  transportation and disposal costs can be adversely affected by unusual weather conditions and unseasonably heavy rainfall  which can temporarily reduce the availability of land application 
material must be transported to either a permitted storage facility if available or to a local landfill for disposal 
in either case  this results in additional costs for transporting  storage and disposal of the biosolid materials versus land application in a period of normal weather conditions 
processing and transportation costs can also be adversely impacted by higher fuel costs 
in order to manage this risk at processing facilities  we generally enter into contracts that pass thru fuel cost increases to the customer  or we lock in our fuel costs with our fuel suppliers for terms ranging from twelve to twenty four months 
we subcontract a significant portion of our transportation requirements to numerous contractors which enables us to minimize the impact of changes in fuel costs for over the road equipment 
we have also periodically implemented temporary fuel surcharges with selected customers 
our costs relating to construction contracts primarily include subcontractor costs related to design  permit and general construction 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised of accounting  information systems  marketing  legal  human resources  regulatory compliance  and regional and executive management costs 
historically  we have included amortization of goodwill resulting from acquisitions as a separate line item in our income statement 
effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and the line item will contain only amortization of intangibles and acquisition related costs for the years ended december   and our management reviews and analyzes several trends and key performance indicators in order to manage our business 
since approximately of our revenues are generated from municipal water and wastewater plants  we monitor trends involving municipal generators  including  among other things  aging infrastructure  technology advances  and regulatory activity in the water and wastewater residuals management industry 
we use this information to anticipate upcoming growth opportunities  including new facility growth opportunities similar to the sacramento  california and pinellas county  florida dryer projects that we started over the past two years 
we also use this information to manage potential business risks such as increased regulatory pressure or local public opposition to residuals management programs 
on an ongoing basis  our management also considers several variables associated with the ongoing operations of the business  including  among other things new sales including the mix of contract and event sales and existing business retention objectives necessary to maintain the company s high percentage of contract and other recurring revenues  storage and permitted landbase available to efficiently manage land application of biosolids  especially during inclement weather patterns  monitoring regulatory and permit compliance requirements and safety programs and initiatives specific to our business  and reviewing and monitoring utility costs  fuel costs  subcontractor transportation costs  equipment utilization and availability  equipment purchasing activity  headcount  field operating overhead and selling  general and administrative expenses

approximately million of the increase related to an percent increase in contract service revenues  approximately million of the increase related to design build work and approximately million of the increase was associated with event revenues 
contract revenues include million of revenue in on a contract that was originally expected to be completed over a multi year period 
excluding this work  contract revenues increased percent in compared to these revenue increases were partially offset by declines in product sales and purchase order revenues 
our residuals management operations revenues for the year ended december   increased approximately million or percent to million compared to million for due primarily to the approximately million increase in contract revenue described above 
our rail transportation revenues for the year ended december   decreased approximately million or percent to million compared to million for due primarily to a decrease in event revenues from cleanout services

gross profit for the year ended december   was approximately million compared to approximately million for  an increase of approximately million  or percent 
gross profit increased due to an increase in margins from increased revenue growth  an improvement in land application margins which benefited from more normal weather patterns in compared to and a significant improvement on cleanout and other event margins  partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance expenses at the company s drying and incineration facilities  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  and a million decrease related to a one time non cash gain associated with a positive settlement of a warranty obligation recorded as a reduction of cost of operations in in  land application margins were negatively impacted by unusually inclement weather primarily on the east coast  which significantly increased our storage  landfill  and transportation costs as we were not able to efficiently access our landbase 
fiscal was one of the wettest years on record in the mid atlantic and southeast states 
land application margins returned to expected levels in as we experienced more normal weather patterns 
cleanout margins were in line with our internal expectations in  and significantly improved over margins which were negatively impacted by certain large cleanout jobs that experienced cost overruns 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or percent 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to percent in from percent in the decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to a million provision for bad debts recognized in versus a million provision recognized in  a reduction in overhead and certain administrative functions implemented in the fourth quarter of  which were partially offset by increased incentive compensation and commissions related to improved operating results in the reduction in certain administrative functions resulted from a management review of our overhead structure in response to the lower than expected operating results for gain loss on sale of assets increased by million primarily as a result of a gain on the sale of land in june as a result of the reduction of overhead and certain administrative functions in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in reorganization costs in related to severance and termination costs

approxi mately million of the increase in revenues relates to increased volume from service and maintenance contracts and approximately million of the increase in revenue relates to acquisitions 
the million increase in revenues from acquisitions relates to the net increase in year over year contract revenues realized from the aspen resource acquisition which was completed in may  and the acquisition of earthwise organics  inc and earthwise trucking collectively earthwise  which was completed in september the increase in revenues from contracts and acquisitions was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million related to design build contract revenues as projects were completed in the first half of and were expected to be replaced by the honolulu project  which was delayed beyond our residuals management operations revenues for the year ended december   increased approximately million or percent to million compared to million for due primarily to the approximately million increase in contract revenue described above 
our rail transportation revenues for the year ended december   increased approximately million or percent to million compared to million for due primarily to an increase in event revenues from cleanout services and an increase in contracted land application revenues 
our engineering  facilities  and development revenues for the year ended december   decreased approximately million to million compared to million for due primarily to a decrease in construction revenues on a new dryer facility in pinellas county  florida which was completed in gross profit for the year ended december   was approximately million compared to approximately million for  a decrease of approximately million  or percent 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to percent in from percent in the decrease in gross profit from to is primarily due to higher than expected handling  storage and disposal costs due to unusually inclement weather incurred primarily in the first half of the year that could not be passed to the customer and cost overruns on certain one time event projects 
additionally  gross profit in was negatively impacted by higher repairs and utilities costs of million 
the settlement of the litigation between the company and riverside county  california resulted in an increase of million in depreciation expense  which impacted  as well as increased insurance costs from unfavorable development of prior year claims on our self insured risk management program totaling million  and approximately million of facility startup costs 
these decreases in gross profit were partially offset by margin from the overall increase in revenue and approximately million of income from a positive settlement of a warranty obligation 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or percent of revenues  for the year ended december   compared to approximately million  or percent of revenues  for  an increase of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percent of revenues primarily due to recording bad debt expense of million in the fourth quarter of in response to lower than expected operating results  management performed a review of our overhead structure and reorganized certain administrative functions in the fourth quarter of as a result of these decisions  we recorded million in reorganization costs in related to severance and termination costs 
amortization of intangibles increased from approximately million in to approximately million in resulting from the write off of million of due diligence costs on potential acquisitions that were not consummated 
as a result of the foregoing  income from operations for the year ended december   decreased to approximately million from approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million  or percent

our rail transportation income from operations increased from million in to million in due primarily to the increase in revenues described above 
our engineering  facilities  and development loss from operations increased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in due primarily to the decrease in construction revenues related to a new dryer facility described above 
other expense for the year ended december   was approximately million compared to approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease relates primarily to the write off of deferred debt costs of million related to the refinancing of debt in  offset by a gain associated with an offset swap arrangement entered into in of approximately million

our provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes 
our tax provision is principally a deferred tax provision that will not significantly impact cash flow since we have significant tax deductions in excess of book deductions and net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives and asset retirement obligations and preferred stock dividends decreased to approximately million for compared to approximately million in liquidity and capital resources overview during the past three years  our principal sources of funds were cash generated from our operating activities 
we use cash mainly for capital expenditures  working capital and debt service 
in the future  we expect that we will use cash principally to fund working capital  our debt service and repayment obligations  and capital expenditures 
in addition  we may use cash to pay dividends on our preferred stock and potential earn out payments resulting from prior acquisitions 
we have historically financed our acquisitions principally through the issuance of equity and debt securities  our credit facility  and funds provided by operating activities 
historical cash flows cash flows from operating activities 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities increased to approximately million from approximately million for the same period in  an increase of approximately million  or percent 
the increase primarily relates to a million increase in net income applicable to common stock  a million increase in noncash charges related to depreciation and amortization expense and deferred income taxes  and a reduction of cash required for working capital of million 
accounts receivable and current costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings as a percentage of total annual revenue increased from percent at december  to percent at december  this increase is primarily related to an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of approximately million on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this increase in cost in excess of billings was offset by an increase in accounts payable including payments to subcontractors which are not made until payments on construction billings have been received from the customer  accrued expenses for incentive compensation  insurance premiums and reserves  and other reserves 
the increase in accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings is believed to be fully collectible and thus no additional increase to allowance for doubtful accounts has been deemed necessary 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities decreased to approximately million from approximately million for the same period in  a decrease of approximately million  or percent 
the decrease primarily relates to the decrease in income from operations of million partially offset by cash flow generated from the decrease in prepaid expenses as a result of the change in renewal dates for insurance

for the year ended december   cash flows used for financing activities decreased to approximately million from approximately million for the same period in  a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease primarily relates to a million decrease in debt issuance costs partially offset by a million increase in net repayments on debt totaling approximately million during compared to million during for the year ended december   cash flows used for financing activities increased to approximately million from approximately million for the same period in  an increase of approximately million 
cash flows used for financing activities in primarily related to million of payments on debt  while relates to payments on debt  net of proceeds from debt totaling million and million of debt issuance costs

we expect our capital expenditures for to be approximately million to million  which excludes approximately million expected to be spent on new facilities in debt service requirements in may  we incurred indebtedness of million in connection with the aspen resources acquisition 
the note payable to the former owners is due monthly at an annual interest rate of five percent beginning may in august  we incurred indebtedness of approximately million to the former owners of earthwise in connection with the earthwise acquisition 
terms of the note issued in connection with the acquisition require three equal  annual installments beginning october interest of five percent per annum is payable quarterly beginning october  the first payment was made on september  in may  we entered into an amended and restated million senior credit agreement that provides for a million funded term loan and up to a million revolver  with the ability to increase the total commitment to million 
the term loan proceeds were used to pay off the existing senior debt that remained unpaid after the private placement of our million aggregate principal amount of percent senior subordinated notes due this credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries other than assets securing nonrecourse debt and includes covenants restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens  certain payments and sale of assets

during may  we amended our senior credit agreement to increase the revolving loan commitment to approximately million 
requirements for mandatory debt payments from excess cash flows  as defined  are unchanged in the new credit facility 
on march   we further amended our senior credit agreement to  among other things  exclude certain charges from its financial covenant calculations  to clarify certain defined terms  to increase the amount of indebtedness permitted under its total leverage ratio  and to reset capital and operating lease limitations 
in april  we completed the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of percent senior subordinated notes due and used the proceeds to pay down approximately million of senior bank debt and to pay off approximately million of percent subordinated debt 
in september  we exchanged all of our outstanding  unregistered percent senior subordinated notes due for registered percent senior subordinated notes due  with substantially identical terms 
during  we recorded a million noncash write off to other expense  which represents the unamortized deferred debt costs related to the debt that was repaid with the net proceeds received from the notes and the new senior credit facility 
in  the maryland energy financing administration the administration issued nonrecourse tax exempt project revenue bonds the maryland project revenue bonds in the aggregate amount of million 
the administration loaned the proceeds of the maryland project revenue bonds to wheelabrator water technologies baltimore llc  now our wholly owned subsidiary known as synagro baltimore  llc  pursuant to a june loan agreement  and the terms of the loan mirror the terms of the maryland project revenue bonds 
the loan financed a portion of the costs of constructing thermal facilities located in baltimore county  maryland  at the site of its back river wastewater treatment plant  and in the city of baltimore  maryland  at the site of its patapsco wastewater treatment plant 
we assumed all obligations associated with the maryland project revenue bonds in connection with our acquisition of bio gro in maryland project revenue bonds in the aggregate amount of approximately million have already been paid  and the remaining maryland project revenue bonds bear interest at annual rates between percent and percent and mature on dates between december  and december  in december  the california pollution control financing authority the authority issued nonrecourse revenue bonds in the aggregate amount of million 
the nonrecourse revenue bonds consist of a face amount of million series a and a face amount of million series b taxable collectively  the sacramento bonds 
the authority loaned the proceeds of the sacramento bonds to sacramento project finance  inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  pursuant to a loan agreement dated december  the loan will finance the acquisition  design  permitting  constructing and equipping of a biosolids dewatering and heat drying pelletizing facility for the sacramento regional sanitation district 
the sacramento bonds bear interest at annual rates between percent and percent and mature on dates between december   and december  at december   future minimum principal payments of long term debt  nonrecourse project revenue bonds see note  capital lease obligations see note  estimated interest expense on debt and operating lease obligations are as follows in thousands nonrecourse capital long term project lease estimated operating year ended december  debt revenue bonds obligations interest leases total thereafter     total       interest expense is estimated because certain of our debt has variable interest rates 
for purposes of this estimate  variable interest rates as of december  were utilized 
we have entered into various lease transactions to purchase transportation and operating equipment that have been accounted for as capital lease obligations and operating leases 
the capital leases have lease terms of three to six years with interest rates from percent to percent 
the net book value of the equipment related to these capital leases totaled approximately million as of december  the operating leases have terms of two to eight years 
additionally  we have guaranteed a maximum lease risk amount to the lessor of one of the operating leases 
the fair value of this guaranty is approximately million as of december  and is included in current liabilities 
we believe we will have sufficient cash generated by our operations and available through our existing credit facility to provide for future working capital and capital expenditure requirements that will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  including payment of interest on our credit facility and payments on the maryland project revenue bonds and the sacramento bonds 
we cannot assure  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that any cost savings and any operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we make no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
historically  we have reinvested earnings available for distribution to holders of common stock  and accordingly  we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
currently  covenants relating to our outstanding preferred stock and bank debt restrict our ability to pay dividends 
we expect that our board of directors will adopt a dividend policy in the second quarter of that reflects an intention to distribute a substantial portion of the cash generated by our business in excess of operating needs  interest and principal payments on our indebtedness and capital expenditures as regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders 
in connection with the adoption of such a policy  we would enter into a new credit facility allowing for the payment of dividends  all of our outstanding preferred stock would be converted into shares of common stock  and we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock to the public the offering 
our ability to service the new credit facility will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of the new credit facility on or before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance the new credit facility on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we were unable to renew or refinance the new credit facility  our failure to repay all amounts due on the maturity date would cause a default under the new credit facility 
based on the dividend policy with respect to our common stock which our board of directors will adopt upon the closing of the offering  we may not have any significant cash available to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements  other than available borrowings  if any  under our new revolver 
as a result  we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to finance growth opportunities  including acquisitions  or unanticipated capital expenditures or to fund our operations 
if we do not have sufficient cash for these purposes  our financial condition and our business will suffer 
however  our board of directors may  in its discretion  amend or repeal this dividend policy to decrease the level of dividends provided for under the policy  or discontinue entirely the payment of dividends 
series d redeemable preferred stock we have authorized  shares of series d preferred stock  par value 
per share 
in  we issued a total of  shares of the series d preferred stock to gtcr fund vii  lp and its affiliates  which is convertible by the holders into a number of shares of our common stock computed by dividing i the sum of a the number of shares to be converted multiplied by the liquidation value and b the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends by ii the conversion price then in effect 
the initial conversion price is per share provided that in order to prevent dilution  the conversion price may be adjusted 
the series d preferred stock is senior to our common stock or any other of our equity securities 
the liquidation value of each share of series d preferred stock is  per share 
dividends on each share of series d preferred stock accrue daily at the rate of eight percent per annum on the aggregate liquidation value and may be paid in cash or accrued  at our option 
upon conversion of the series d preferred stock by the holders  the holders may elect to receive the accrued and unpaid dividends in shares of our common stock at the conversion price 
the series d preferred stock is entitled to one vote per share 
shares of series d preferred stock are subject to mandatory redemption by us on january   at a price per share equal to the liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
if the outstanding shares of series d preferred stock excluding accrued dividends were converted at december   they would represent  shares of common stock 
series e redeemable preferred stock we have authorized  shares of series e preferred stock  par value 
per share 
gtcr fund vii  lp and its affiliates own  shares of series e preferred stock and certain affiliates of the tcw group  inc own  shares

if the outstanding shares of series e preferred stock excluding accrued dividends were converted at december   they would represent  shares of common stock 
the future issuance of series d and series e preferred stock may result in noncash beneficial conversions valued in future periods recognized as preferred stock dividends if the market value of our common stock is higher than the conversion price at date of issuance 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  statement of accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation was revised sfas no 
r 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement addresses concerns of users and others  improves the comparability of reported financial information by eliminating alternative accounting methods and simplifies generally accepted accounting standards in the united states 
the statement is effective for periods beginning after june  the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the implementation of this statement 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following are our significant estimates and assumptions made in preparation of our financial statements that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts receivables based on the aging of the accounts receivable and the evaluation and the likelihood of success in collecting the receivable 
accounts receivables are written off periodically during the year as they are deemed uncollectible when collection efforts have been unsuccessful 
allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and  was approximately million and million  respectively and is recorded as a reduction of accounts receivables 
loss contracts we evaluate our revenue producing contracts to determine whether the projected revenues of such contracts exceed the direct cost to service such contracts 
these evaluations include estimates of the future revenues and expenses 
accruals for loss contracts are adjusted based on these evaluations 
the total accrual for loss contracts included in the consolidated balance sheet was million and million  as of december  and  respectively  related to one contract entered into in an accrual for loss contracts was not required as of december  long term construction contracts certain long term construction projects are accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting and accordingly revenues are recorded based on estimates of total costs to be incurred under the contract 
we typically subcontract a portion of the work to subcontractors under fixed price contracts 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed under the terms of contracts accounted for on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
these amounts are billable upon completion of contract performance milestones or other specified conditions of the contract 
property and equipment long lived assets management adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets during if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we perform a test of recoverability 
the carrying amount of an asset group is considered impaired if it exceeds the sum of our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group  excluding interest charges 
we regularly incur costs to develop potential projects or facilities and procure contracts for the design  permitting  construction and operations of facilities 
we recorded million in property and long term assets related to these activities at december   compared to million at december  approximately million and million are classified as construction in progress as of december  and  respectively 
we routinely review the status of each of these projects to determine if these costs are realizable 
goodwill goodwill attributable to our reporting units is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
significant estimates used in the determination of fair value include estimates of future cash flows  future growth rates  costs of capital and estimates of market multiples 
as required under current accounting standards  we test for impairment annually at year end unless factors otherwise indicate that impairment may have occurred 
purchase accounting we estimate the fair value of assets  including property  machinery and equipment and its related useful lives and salvage values  and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 
income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the recovery of deferred income tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the activity underlying these assets become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if actual future taxable income differs from our estimates  we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent we have estimated 
as of december   we had generated net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future income taxes 
these carryforwards begin to expire in a change in ownership  as defined by federal income tax regulations  could significantly limit our ability to utilize our carryforwards 
accordingly  our ability to utilize our nols to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities may be limited 
additionally  because federal tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
we estimate that our effective tax rate in will approximate percent of pre tax income 
substantially all of our tax provision over the next several years is expected to be deferred in nature due to significant tax deductions in excess of book deductions for goodwill and depreciation 
legal and contingency accruals we estimate and accrue the amount of probable exposure we may have with respect to litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on management s assessment of the facts and the probabilities of the ultimate resolution of the litigation 
self insurance reserves we are substantially self insured for workers compensation  employers liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks 
losses up to deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends  industry averages and actuarial assumptions regarding future claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
other we maintain one lease with an affiliate of one of our stockholders 
the lease has an initial term through december  rental payments made under this lease in totaled approximately million 
risk factors which may affect future results federal wastewater treatment and biosolid regulations may restrict our operations or increase our costs of operations 
federal wastewater treatment and wastewater residuals laws and regulations impose substantial costs on us and affect our business in many ways 
if we are not able to comply with the governmental regulations and requirements that apply to our operations  we could be subject to fines and penalties  and we may be required to invest significant capital to bring operations into compliance or to temporarily or permanently stop operations that are not permitted under the law 
those costs or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
federal environmental authorities regulate the activities of the municipal and industrial wastewater generators and enforce standards for the discharge from wastewater treatment plants effluent wastewater with permits issued under the authority of the clean water act  as amended 
the treatment of wastewater produces an effluent and wastewater solids 
the treatment of these solids produces biosolids 
the use and disposal of biosolids and wastewater residuals is regulated by cfr part regulations promulgated by the epa pursuant to the clean water act part regulations 
the part regulations also establish use and disposal standards for biosolids and wastewater residuals that are applicable to publicly and privately owned wastewater treatment plants in the united states 
biosolids may be surface disposed in landfills  incinerated  or applied to land for beneficial use in accordance with the requirements established by the regulations 
to the extent demand for our wastewater residuals treatment methods is created by the need to comply with the environmental laws and regulations  any modification of the standards created by such laws and regulations  or in their enforcement  may reduce the demand for our wastewater residuals treatment methods 
changes in these laws or regulations and or changes in the enforcement of these laws or regulations may also adversely affect our operations by imposing additional regulatory compliance costs on us  and requiring the modification of and or adversely affecting the market for our wastewater residuals management services 
we are subject to extensive and increasingly strict federal  state and local environmental regulation and permitting  which could impose substantial costs on our operations or reduce our operational flexibility 
our operations are subject to increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations  including laws and regulations governing the emission  discharge  treatment  storage  disposal and transportation of certain substances and related odor 
wastewater treatment plants and other plants at which our biosolids management services may be implemented are usually required to have permits  registrations and or approvals from state and or local governments for the operation of such facilities 
some of our facilities require air  wastewater  storm water  composting  use or siting permits  registrations or approvals 
we may not be able to maintain or renew our current permits  registrations or licensing agreements or to obtain new permits  registrations or licensing agreements  including for the land application of biosolids when necessary 
the process of obtaining a required permit  registration or license agreement can be lengthy and expensive 
we may not be able to meet applicable regulatory or permit requirements  and therefore may be subject to related legal or judicial proceedings 
many states  municipalities and counties have regulations  guidelines or ordinances covering the land application of biosolids  many of which set either a maximum allowable concentration or maximum pollutant loading rate for at least one pollutant 
the part regulations also require certain monitoring to ensure that certain pollutants or pathogens are below designated thresholds 
the epa has considered increasing these thresholds or adding new thresholds for different substances  which could increase our compliance costs 
in addition  some states have established management practices for land application of biosolids 
some members of congress  some state and local authorities  and some private parties  have sought to prohibit or limit the land application  agricultural use  thermal processing or composting of biosolids 
much of this public opposition and challenge  as well as related complaints  relates to odor issues  even when we are in compliance with odor requirements and even though we have worked hard to minimize odor from our operations 
public misperceptions about our business and any related odor could influence the governmental process for issuing such permits  registrations and licensing agreements or for responding to any such public opposition or challenge 
community groups could pressure local municipalities or state governments to implement laws and regulations which could increase our costs of our operations 
in states where we currently conduct business  certain counties and municipalities have banned the land application of class b biosolids 
other states and local authorities are reviewing their current regulations relative to land application of biosolids 
there can be no assurances that these or other prohibition or limitation efforts will not be successful and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  many states enforce landfill restrictions for nonhazardous biosolids and some states have site restrictions or other management practices governing lands 
these regulations typically require a permit to use biosolid products including incineration ash as landfill daily cover material or for disposal in the landfill 
it is possible that landfill operators will not be able to obtain or maintain such required permits 
any of the permits  registrations or approvals noted above  or related applications may be subject to denial  revocation or modification  or challenge by a third party  under various circumstances  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
we are affected by unusually adverse weather and winter conditions  which may adversely affect our revenues and operational results 
our business is adversely affected by unusual weather conditions and unseasonably heavy rainfall  which can temporarily reduce the availability of land application sites in close proximity to our business upon which biosolids can be beneficially reused and applied to crop land 
material must be transported to either a permitted storage facility if available or to a local landfill for disposal 
in either case  this results in additional costs for disposal of the biosolids material 
in addition  our revenues and operational results are adversely affected during the winter months when the ground freezes thus limiting the level of land application that can be performed 
long periods of inclement weather could reduce our revenues and operational results causing a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
our ability to grow may be limited by direct or indirect competition with other businesses that provide some or all of the same services that we provide 
we provide a variety of services relating to the transportation and treatment of wastewater residuals 
we are in direct and indirect competition with other businesses that provide some or all of the same services including small local companies  regional residuals management companies  and national and international water and wastewater operations privatization companies  technology suppliers  municipal solid waste companies  farming operations and  most significantly  municipalities and industries who choose not to outsource their residuals management needs 
some of these competitors are larger  more firmly established and have greater capital resources than we have 
if our long term contracts are renewed on less attractive terms  or not renewed at all  or if we are unsuccessful in bidding on new long term contracts  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from services provided under municipal contracts 
a portion of our contracts expire annually and are sometimes subject to competitive bidding 
any contracts that are successfully renewed may be on less attractive terms and conditions than the expired agreement 
we also intend to bid on new municipal contracts 
in the event we are unable to renew our existing contracts on attractive terms  or at all  or be successful in bidding on new contracts  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
if one or more of our customer contracts are terminated prior to the expiration of their term  and we are not able to replace revenues from the terminated contract or receive liquidated damages pursuant to the terms of the contract  the lost revenue would have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from services provided under contracts and written agreements with our customers 
some of these contracts  especially those contracts with large municipalities including our largest contract and at least four of our other top ten customers  provide for termination of the contract by the customer after giving relative short notice in some cases as little as ten days 
in addition  some of these contracts contain liquidated damages clauses  which may or may not be enforceable in the event of early termination of the contracts 
if one or more of our new facilities is not completed as scheduled  and we are not able to replace revenues from the new facility  this could have a material and adverse effect on our financial performance and cash flow 
our ability to generate revenues and cash flow sufficient to pay dividends on our outstanding common stock and interest on outstanding debt is dependent upon successfully financing and completing five new facilities scheduled to commence operations in and although permitting processes for all five new facilities are complete and construction is in progress or near completion  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete construction as scheduled and begin to operate the facilities without the need to remedy certain defects that may arise immediately after construction 
in addition  as with our other facilities  our relationship is governed by customer contracts which can be terminated prior to the expiration of their term 
a significant amount of our business comes from a limited number of customers and our revenue and profits could decrease significantly if we lost one or more of them as customers 
our business depends on our ability to provide services to our customers 
one or more of these customers may stop buying services from us or may substantially reduce the amount of services we provide them 
any cancellation  deferral or significant reduction in the services we provide these principal customers or a significant number of smaller customers could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   our single largest customer accounted for percent of our revenues and our top ten customers accounted for approximately percent of our revenues 
if we were unable to obtain bonding required in connection with certain projects  we would be ineligible to bid on those projects 
consistent with industry practice  we are required to post performance bonds in connection with certain contracts on which we bid 
in addition  we are often required to post both performance and payment bonds at the time of execution of contracts for commercial  federal  state and municipal projects 
the amount of bonding capacity offered by sureties is a function of the financial health of the entity requesting the bonding 
although we could issue letters of credit under our credit facility for bonding purposes  if we are unable to obtain bonding in sufficient amounts we may be ineligible to bid or negotiate on projects 
as of march   we had a bonding capacity of approximately million with approximately million utilized as of that date 
we could face personal injury  third party or environmental claims or other damages resulting in substantial liability for which we are uninsured or inadequately insured and which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we carry million of liability insurance including umbrella coverage  and under a separate policy  million of aggregate pollution and legal liability insurance million each loss subject to retroactive dates  which we consider sufficient to meet regulatory and customer requirements and to protect our employees  assets and operations 
it is possible that we will not be able to maintain such insurance coverage in the future 
our insurance programs utilize large deductible self insured retention plans offered by a commercial insurance company 
large deductible self insured retention plans allow us the benefits of cost effective risk financing while protecting us from catastrophic risk with specific stop loss insurance limiting the amount of self funded exposure for any single loss 
we are dependent on the availability and satisfactory performance of subcontractors for our design and build operations and the insufficiency and unavailability of and unsatisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third party contractors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we participate in design and build construction operations usually as general contractor 
virtually all design and construction work is performed by unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
as a consequence  we are dependent on the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by these subcontractors for the design and construction of our facilities 
further  as the general contractor  we are legally responsible for the performance of our contracts and if such contracts are underperformed or nonperformed by our subcontractors  we could be financially responsible 
although our contracts with our subcontractors provide for indemnification if our subcontractors do not satisfactorily perform their contract  such indemnification may not cover our financial losses in attempting to fulfill the contractual obligations 
fluctuations in fuel costs could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our net income 
the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control  including geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
because fuel is needed to run the fleet of trucks that service our customers  our incinerators  our dryers and other facilities  price escalations or reductions in the supply of fuel could increase our operating expenses and have a negative impact on net income 
in the past  we have implemented a fuel surcharge to offset increased fuel costs 
however  we are not always able to pass through all or part of the increased fuel costs due to the terms of certain customers contracts and the inability to negotiate such pass through costs in a timely manner 
if we fail to properly estimate the cost of completing a project  and we cannot pass additional costs through to our customers  we may not generate sufficient revenue from the project to cover the operating costs of such project  which would adversely affect our net income 
our customer contracts involve performing tasks for a fixed cost in total or on a per unit basis  and if actual costs end up exceeding anticipated costs  our net income would be adversely affected 
due in part to the technical imprecision inherent in estimating the volume of residuals  we may misestimate the volume of residuals  which may increase our costs 
to the extent that unexpected costs may arise in connection with work done pursuant to contracts that do not allow us to fully transfer such costs to our customers  our operating costs would increase and our net income would in turn be negatively affected 
we are not able to guarantee that our estimated remaining contract value  which we call backlog  will result in actual revenues in any particular fiscal period 
any of the contracts included in our backlog  or estimated remaining contract value  presented herein may not result in actual revenues in any particular period or the actual revenues from such contracts may not equal our backlog 
in determining backlog  we calculate the expected payments remaining under the current terms of our contracts  assuming the renewal of contracts in accordance with their renewal provisions  no increase in the level of services during the remaining term  and estimated adjustments for changes in the consumer price index for contracts that contain price indexing 
however  part or all of our backlog may not be recognized as revenue or earnings 
if we lose the pending lawsuits we are currently involved in  we could be liable for significant damages and legal expenses 
in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in various legal and administrative proceedings  including some related to our permits  to land use or to environmental laws and regulations 
we are currently subject to several lawsuits relating to our business 
our defense of these claims or any other claims against us may not be successful 
if we lose these or future lawsuits  we may have to pay significant damages and legal expenses  and we could be subject to injunctions  court orders  loss of revenues and defaults under our credit and other agreements 
see business legal proceedings 
we could face considerable business and financial risk in implementing our acquisition strategy 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to consider acquiring complementary businesses 
we regularly engage in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position and results of operations 
risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  potential loss of employees  diversion of management s attention away from other business concerns  expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company  and risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
in addition  it is possible that we will not be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 
as we pursue our acquisition strategy  we might experience periods of rapid growth that could strain our management  as well as our operational  financial and other resources 
such a strain might negatively impact our ability to retain our existing employees 
in order to maintain and manage our growth effectively  we will need to expand our management information systems capabilities and improve our operational and financial systems and controls 
as we grow  our staffing requirements will increase significantly 
we will need to attract  train  motivate  retain and manage our senior managers  technical professionals and other employees 
we might not be able to find and train qualified personnel  or do so on a timely basis  or expand our operations and systems to the extent  and in the time  required 
we are dependent on our senior management for their depth of industry experience and knowledge 
we are highly dependent on the services of our senior management team 
our senior management team has been in the industry for many years and has substantial industry knowledge and contacts 
if a member of our senior management team were to terminate his association with us  we could lose valuable human capital  adversely affecting our business 
we currently do not maintain key man insurance on any member of our senior management team 
we generally enter into employment agreements with members of our senior management team  which contain noncompete and other provisions 
the laws of each state differ concerning the enforceability of noncompetition agreements 
state courts will examine all of the facts and circumstances at the time a party seeks to enforce a noncompete covenant 
we cannot predict with certainty whether or not a court will enforce a noncompete covenant in any given situation based on the facts and circumstances at that time 
if one of our key executive officers were to leave us and the courts refused to enforce the noncompete covenant  we might be subject to increased competition  which could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
efforts by labor unions to organize our employees could divert management attention and increase our operating expenses 
certain groups of our employees have chosen to be represented by unions  and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with some of the groups 
the negotiation of these agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income 
if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements  we might have to wait through cooling off periods  which are often followed by union initiated work stoppages  including strikes 
depending on the type and duration of such work stoppage  our operating expenses could increase significantly 
we may become subject to cercla or other federal or state cleanup laws  which could increase our costs of operations 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla generally imposes strict  joint and several liability for cleanup costs upon various parties  including present owners and operators of facilities at which hazardous substances were disposed  past owners and operators at the time of disposal  generators of hazardous substances that were disposed at such facilities  and parties who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at such facilities 
the costs of a cercla cleanup or a cleanup required by applicable state environmental laws can be very expensive 
given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability  cercla liability or any liability imposed under state cleanup laws could have a material impact on our business and financial condition 
cercla liability extends to cleanup costs necessitated by a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance 
the definition of release under cercla excludes the normal application of fertilizer 
the epa regards the land application of biosolids that meet the part regulations as a normal application of fertilizer  and thus not subject to cercla 
however  if we were to transport or handle biosolids that contain hazardous substances in violation of the part regulations  we could be liable under cercla 
from time to time  we manage hazardous substances which we dispose at landfills or we transport soils or other materials which may contain hazardous substances to landfills 
we also send residuals and ash from our incinerators to landfills for use as daily cover over the landfill 
liability under cercla  or comparable state statutes  can be founded on the disposal  or arrangement for disposal  of hazardous substances at sites such as landfills and for the transporting of such substances to landfills 
under cercla  or comparable state statutes  we may be liable for the remediation of a disposal site that was never owned or operated by us if the site contains hazardous substances that we generated or transported to such site 
we could also be responsible for hazardous substances during actual transportation and may be liable for environmental response measures arising out of disposal at a third party site with whom we had contracted 
in addition  under cercla  or comparable state statutes  we could be required to clean any of our current or former properties if hazardous substances are released or are otherwise found to be present 
we are currently monitoring the remediation of soil and groundwater at one of our properties in cooperation with the applicable state regulatory authority  but do not believe any additional material expenditures will be required 
however  there can be no assurance that currently unknown contamination would not be found on this or other properties 
our intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as licensing agreements 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology 
to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information  we require employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements 
we cannot be assured that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies  we could be materially adversely affected 
if we determine that our goodwill is impaired  we may have to write off all or part of it 
goodwill represents the aggregate purchase price paid by us in acquisitions accounted for as a purchase over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill  but review annually for impairment 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if a write down to market value of all or part of our goodwill becomes necessary  our accounting results and net worth would be adversely affected 
as of december   our total goodwill  net of amortization  was approximately million 
we may be unable to meet changing laws  regulations and standards related to corporate governance and public disclosure 
we are spending increasing amount of management time and external resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules 
in particular  section and of the sarbanes oxley act of require management s annual review and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures  and beginning in attestations of the effectiveness of these controls by our independent registered public accounting firm 
the process of documenting and testing our controls has required that we hire additional personnel and outside advisory services and has resulted in additional accounting and legal expenses 
while we invested significant time and money in our effort to evaluate and test our internal control over financial reporting  material weaknesses were identified in our internal control over financial reporting at december  see item a 
controls and procedures 
although we believe that the steps we are taking have or will remediate the material weaknesses identified  our disclosure of the material weaknesses may impact investor perception of our company and may affect our stock price 
in addition  there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures  including cost limitations  the possibility of human error  judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of future events  and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures 
accordingly even effective disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize financial instruments  which inherently have some degree of market risk due to interest rate fluctuations 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not currently use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
derivatives and hedging activities on september   we entered into an interest rate swap transaction on million of our percent senior subordinated notes due that matures on april  under the terms of the agreement  we pay a fixed rate of percent and receive a floating rate based on six month libor 
the mark to market value of this swap was recorded as a reduction in interest expense of million as of december  on july   we entered into two interest rate swap transactions with two financial institutions to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value on million of our notes 
the purpose of these transactions was to convert future interest due on million of the notes to a lower variable rate in an attempt to realize savings on our future interest payments 
the terms of the interest rate swap contract and the underlying debt instruments are identical 
we have designated these swap agreements as fair value hedges 
on september   we unwound million of these swaps and received a settlement payment of approximately million that was deducted from interest expense 
accordingly  we currently have million of the original million of interest rate swaps outstanding 
the swaps have notional amounts of million and million and mature in april to mirror the maturity of the notes 
under the agreements  we pay on a semi annual basis each april and october a floating rate based on a six month us dollar libor rate  plus a spread  and receive a fixed rate interest of percent 
during  we recorded interest savings related to these interest rate swaps of million  which reduced interest expense 
the million fair value of these derivative instruments is included in other long term liabilities  as of december  the carrying value of our notes was decreased by the same amount 
on january   we unwound the million and million remaining balance on these swaps and paid million for the settlement of these swaps 
the percent subordinated debt was repaid on april   with the proceeds from the sale of the notes 
on june   we entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement that substantially offsets market value changes in our reverse swap agreement 
the liability related to this reverse swap agreement and the floating to fixed offset agreement totaling approximately million is reflected in other long term liabilities at december  the loss recognized during  related to the floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement was approximately million  while the gain recognized related to the reverse swap agreement was approximately million 
the amount of the ineffectiveness of the reverse swap agreement charged to other expense was approximately  as of december on june   we entered into a reverse swap on our percent subordinated debt and used the proceeds from the reverse swap agreement to retire previously outstanding floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements the retired swaps and option agreements 
accordingly  the balance included in accumulated other comprehensive loss included in stockholders equity related to the retired swaps is being recognized in future periods income over the remaining term of the original swap agreement 
the amount of accumulated other comprehensive income recognized during  was approximately million 
interest rate risk total debt at december   included approximately million in floating rate debt at a base interest rate plus percent  or approximately percent and approximately million in floating rate debt at an interest rate of approximately percent attributed to the senior credit agreement at december  we also have interest rate swaps outstanding on our fixed rate debt 
as a result  our interest costs in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a ten percent change in the floating rate ie libor would be approximately million
