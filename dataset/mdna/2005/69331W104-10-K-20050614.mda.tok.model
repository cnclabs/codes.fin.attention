item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
critical accounting policies the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for losses on loans  leases and foreclosed assets 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for losses on our loans  leases and foreclosed assets on a quarterly basis for the purpose of maintaining an appropriate allowance to provide for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
a key component to the evaluation is the internal asset review process 
the internal asset review committee meets quarterly to review the recommendations from the internal asset review department for asset classifications and valuation allowances 
on a monthly basis  we monitor and modify the allowance for loan and lease losses alll based upon economic conditions  loss experience  changes in portfolio composition and other factors 
in determining the amount of the gva  we stratify our loan portfolio into approximately segments based upon factors such as loan type and internal classification 
each of these segments is assigned a separate probable loss factor 
our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the office of thrift supervision the ots who can order the establishment of additional loss allowances 
the ots  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the alll 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of valuation allowances 
the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  that management analyze all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio in a reasonable manner  and that management establish an acceptable allowance evaluation process that meets the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
while the bank believes that it has established an adequate alll  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan and lease portfolio  will not request the bank to materially increase its alll  thereby negatively affecting the bank s financial condition and earnings 
although management believes that an adequate alll has been established  further additions to the level of alll may become necessary

mortgage servicing rights 
gains or losses on sales of loans are recognized at the time of sale and are determined by the difference between the net sales proceeds and the allocated basis of the loans sold 
we capitalize mortgage servicing rights msr through the sale of mortgage loans which are sold with servicing rights retained 
at the time of sale  the total cost of the mortgage loans is allocated to the msr and the mortgage loans based upon their relative fair values 
the msr are included in other assets and as a component of the gain on the sale of loans 
the msr are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period of the net servicing income 
this amortization is reflected as a component of loan and servicing fees 
the msr are periodically reviewed for impairment based upon their fair value 
we determine fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of key assumptions including prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
information supporting the assumptions is obtained from reputable market sources 
impairment losses are recognized through a valuation allowance  with any associated provision recorded as a component of loan servicing fees 
for further information  see item lending activities loan servicing and note to the consolidated financial statements 
other than temporary impairment 
investment securities held to maturity are carried at cost  or in the case of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations at unpaid principal balance  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized in interest income using the interest method  adjusted for anticipated prepayments 
table of contents where applicable 
it is our intent and within our ability  to hold these securities until maturity as part of our portfolio of long term interest earning assets 
we evaluate all of our investment securities held to maturity on an individual basis no less frequently than quarterly for other than temporary impairment 
in conducting this evaluation  we determine the probability of collection and the risk factors associated with collecting all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the securities 
among the factors considered are the credit ratings of the issuers  any call features inherent in the securities and our intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities available for sale are carried at fair value 
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method  adjusted for anticipated prepayments where applicable 
unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of income taxes

asset liability management our earnings depend primarily on our net interest income 
net interest income is affected by net interest spread 
changes in net interest spread collectively  interest rate risk are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  customer options  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
our asset liability committee alco is responsible for implementing the policies designed to manage our interest rate risk exposure 
the board of directors approves acceptable interest rate risk levels designed to provide sufficient net interest income and net present value of shareholders equity npv assuming specified changes in interest rates 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
one measure of our exposure to interest rate risk is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of our major assets and liabilities as of march  repricing frequencies of assets are based upon contractual maturities  repricing opportunities  scheduled principal payments and estimated prepayments 
repricing of liabilities is based upon the contractual maturities  estimated decay rates for core deposits  and the earliest repricing opportunity for variable and floating rate instruments 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if actual experience differed from that assumed

non interest bearing deposits are classified in the more than years category 
putable borrowings are presented based upon their contractual maturity date 
based on contractual maturity 
table of contents a gap table is limited to measuring timing risk and does not reflect the impact of customer options or basis risk the risk that various indices to which our assets and liabilities are tied eg prime and cofi will not move with equal speed and magnitude when the general level of interest rates moves either up or down 
to better measure our exposure to these and other components of interest rate risk  management relies on an internally maintained  externally supported asset liability simulation model 
we forecast our net interest income for the next twelve months  and our npv  assuming there are no changes in interest rates or the balance sheet structure from the current period end 
once this base case has been established  we subject our balance sheet to instantaneous and sustained rate changes to the treasury yield curve 
prepayment speeds and the responsiveness of the various indices are estimated for each rate change level 
our model provides forecasts of net interest income and npv for each of those rate change scenarios 
the table below indicates the results of our internal modeling of our balance sheet as of march  and the internal calculation of our sensitivity to changes in interest rates would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if our customers responses to changes in interest rates resulted in changes in the structure of our balance sheet 
march  march  percentage change change in interest rates basis points net interest income net portfolio value net interest income net portfolio value n a n a this percentage change represents the impact to net interest income for a one year period assuming we do not change the structure of our balance sheet 
this percentage change represents the npv for us assuming no changes to the structure of our balance sheet 
a negative basis point rate shock was not calculated for march  due to the low level of interest rates 
the results from the asset liability model indicate that net interest income has greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates at march  than was the case at march  and is forecasted to improve in an up basis point rate scenario as of march   rather than decrease in an up basis point rate scenario a year earlier 
the change in earnings sensitivity was due to several factors 
the four c products comprise a greater percentage of our earning assets and are generally more responsive to changes in interest rates 
our funding sources continued to transition to a greater percentage of core deposits which have exhibited less responsiveness to interest rate changes 
the seasoning of our residential mortgage loans over the past year has resulted in the weighted average term to first reset of our hybrid arm portfolio shortening from months at march  to months at march during the past year we have changed the modeling assumptions for our interest bearing core deposit 
table of contents products 
while core deposit accounts are anticipated to exhibit less sensitivity to rate changes than either cd accounts or fixed rate borrowings  it is anticipated that they will exhibit greater sensitivity to upward movements in rates at march  than one year earlier 
the increase in the general level of short term interest rates resulting from the federal reserve s tightening of monetary policy beginning in june has increased the differential between rates paid on certificate accounts cds and interest bearing core deposits providing depositors with a greater opportunity to increase returns by transferring from core deposits to cds 
our assumption of increased rate sensitivity for our core deposits is also based upon changes in the general competitive environment 
we are beginning to see increasing rate driven competition for our deposit customers in the form of competitors promotional offerings on short term cds and higher rate money market accounts 
while we will continue to make every effort to continue to increase our deposit base through reasonable rate negotiation and promotional offerings there is an increasing possibility that some of our deposit customers may be attracted to promotional rates offered by our competitors necessitating that we respond with increases to our deposit pricing 
our modeling indicates decreased sensitivity to the npv of equity at march  compared to march  the factors discussed above affecting the sensitivity of earnings have contributed to the decrease in the sensitivity of npv 
the four c products  with generally shorter maturities  and greater rate reset frequency are generally less susceptible to market value deterioration in times of rising rates than mortgage products with longer maturities  less frequent rate reset opportunities  and periodic rate caps 
the change in sensitivity of npv was also impacted by changes in our funding mix 
at march   percent of our total asset base was funded with deposits compared to percent at march  deposit accounts typically exhibit lower sensitivity to rate changes than do borrowings 
the lower sensitivity provides greater stability for funding costs during times of rising interest rates 
this stability in funding costs is expressed as a deposit intangible in modeling of npv 
typically the market value of the deposit intangible moves inversely with the market value of assets 
when rates rise  the market value of assets will typically decline and the value of the deposit intangible will increase 
with a greater percentage of assets funded with deposits  there is a larger deposit intangible available to counter the impact of changing interest rates 

table of contents results of operations overview assets total assets increased million or during fiscal to billion 
the increase in total assets reflects a million or increase in loans and leases receivable  net  partially offset by a decrease of million in securities 
the million increase in loans and leases receivable  net  is comprised of a million or increase in the four cs partially offset by a reduction in one to four family residential mortgages reflecting our continued emphasis on the higher yielding four cs loan products 
that emphasis is further demonstrated by the origination figures in the following table year ended march  amount percentage of total originations amount percentage of total originations amount percentage of total originations dollars in thousands construction and land commercial real estate consumer commercial loans and leases subtotal four cs residential and other total originations includes family and multi family 
the net disbursed balance of the four cs increased million between march  and and million between march  and at march   the aggregate disbursed balance of the four cs was billion or of loans and leases receivable  net compared to billion or at march  we are continuing to allocate our capital first to supporting our strong four cs loan growth and secondly to maintaining our quarterly cash dividend 
it has been our policy that excess capital above our targeted capital to assets ratio range of approximately has been used to continue our stock repurchase program 
see part ii item market for registrants common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
we believe that utilizing excess capital to repurchase our common stock is preferable to growing our securities portfolio 
reflecting that philosophy  we have established an internal guideline of limiting securities as a percentage of total assets to no more than percent 
at march   securities represented of total assets and averaged of total assets for fiscal liabilities deposits increased million or during fiscal to billion 
reflecting our emphasis on core deposits as will as general interest rate and competitive market conditions  our customers did not have an incentive to place money into cds as opposed to interest bearing liquid accounts 
core deposits increased million or during fiscal to billion or of total deposits 
although we believe some rate sensitive cd 
table of contents customers placed money in higher yielding liquid accounts during fiscal  our weighted average cost of core deposits for fiscal remained low at compared to for fiscal this low weighted average cost of core deposits was positively influenced by strong growth in non interest bearing demand deposits  which increased million or percent during fiscal to million or percent of total deposits 
during fiscal  we issued million of junior subordinated debentures  of which million of the proceeds from this issuance were used to provide the bank with a cost effective source of regulatory capital 
see part item description of business sources of funds junior subordinated debentures and regulation and supervision federal savings institution regulation and liquidity and capital resources within this section 
the million decrease in fhlb advances and other borrowings during fiscal reflects the million of deposit growth in excess of total asset growth along with million of proceeds raised from the issuance of the subordinated debentures 
stockholders equity total stockholders equity increased from million or of total assets at march  to million or of total assets at march  these levels remain slightly above our target range 
consistent with our philosophy of favoring share repurchases over increasing our investment in securities  during fiscal  we repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of per share 
we also increased our quarterly cash dividend by to per share effective with our fourth quarter dividend paid in march our dividend payout ratio for fiscal was  see part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
operating results our net income for fiscal totaled million or per diluted share  up from fiscal s million or per diluted share  and fiscal s million or per diluted share 
the increase in our net income between fiscal years primarily reflected the following increases in net interest income arising from growth in average interest earning assets 
decreases in provision for loan and lease losses attributable to an improvement in the level of asset quality 
increases in non interest income arising from increases in deposit and related fees arising from growth in transaction accounts 
increases in gain on sales of securities 
increase in trust  investment and insurance fees from growth in assets under management and higher insurance fee income 
these favorable items were partially offset by increases in general and administrative expense attributable principally to compensation and benefits expense 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans and leases  mortgage backed securities and investment securities interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative dollar amounts of these assets and liabilities are the principal items affecting net interest income 

table of contents our net interest income totaled million in fiscal  up million or from fiscal between fiscal and net interest income increased million or 
these increases were primarily attributable to increases in average interest earnings assets of million or between fiscal and and million or between fiscal and after expanding basis points between fiscal and  net interest spread contracted basis point between fiscal and due principally to a high level of turnover in the loan and lease portfolio 
our net interest spread and net interest income are also impacted by the repricing or rate adjustment characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table presents for the years indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resultant costs  expressed as rates 
the table also sets forth our net interest income  net interest spread and net interest margin 
net interest margin reflects net interest spread and the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities

consolidated trust assets and assets under management were million  million and million at march   and  respectively 
consolidated assets under management at march   include million managed by glencrest  which includes million of assets generated by glencrest with the remainder representing assets generated by the bank s trust department 
additionally  glencrest has assets under an advisory capacity of million as of march  as compared to million at march  
table of contents gain on sale of loans our community banking business strategy does not include aggressively pursuing the origination of loans for sale 
the four cs have consistently comprised in excess of of total originations and those four product types are originated for portfolio as opposed to sale 
additionally  we retain for portfolio virtually all adjustable rate residential mortgages we originate 
accordingly  the principal balances of loans sold during fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
this activity generated net gains on sales of   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
gain on sale of securities we generally follow a buy and hold strategy with respect to our securities portfolio 
while the overwhelming majority of our securities portfolio is classified as available for sale  sales activity has been and is expected to continue to be infrequent 
gain on sales of securities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the sales during fiscal were comprised of a portion of our investment in a single equity security 
we also sold a portion of our investment in this security during fiscal  at a gain of million 
as a result of the strong price appreciation of this security  prudent risk diversification required that the investment be reduced  although not eliminated  to reduce concentration in any single security 
the million net gain for fiscal  included a million loss on sale of million of investment grade trust preferred securities 
at march   the carrying value of the remaining investment in this security was million 
during fiscal we sold million of securities which was primarily composed of higher coupon mbs that had been experiencing or were expected to experience increased levels of prepayments in a lower interest rate environment 
loss on trading securities we liquidated our portfolio of trading securities during march after determining that such activity was inconsistent with our strategic direction and business model 
accordingly  there was no gain or loss on trading securities during fiscal and we incurred net losses on trading activity during fiscal of  other non interest income our other non interest income was  for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and  for fiscal the million for fiscal included a million non recurring increase in cash surrender value of split dollar life insurance policies that we own 
the non interest income arising from increases in cash surrender value during fiscal  and was  million and  respectively 
at march   our balance sheet includes total cash surrender value of million classified as other assets 
non interest expense non interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and million for fiscal general and administrative expense increased from million or of average assets for fiscal to million or of average assets for fiscal and million or of average assets for fiscal while our balance sheet  which is increasingly comprised by four cs and core deposits  generates higher levels of net interest income than would a balance sheet comprised by residential mortgage loans and cds  our higher margin business is also more cost intensive  particularly with respect to compensation levels 
the relationship between net revenue net interest income plus non interest income and operating costs expended to generate that revenue is measured by our efficiency ratio 
our efficiency ratio was for fiscal compared to for fiscal and for fiscal these efficiency ratios indicate that the growth in our net revenue has generally kept pace with our growth in operating costs 

table of contents we expect future improvement in our efficiency ratio reflective of the fact that over the past several years it has been necessary for us to incur infrastructure costs to support the increased volumes of higher margin business in advance of those volumes being generated 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense accounted for million or of the million increase in general and administrative expense between fiscal and fiscal and million or of the million increase in general and administrative expense between fiscal and these increases reflect increases in both the number and compensation levels of staff required to support our higher margin lending four cs and deposit gathering core deposits activities 
the increases in compensation and benefits also reflect the bank s opening of three new full service retail branches each during both fiscal and included in compensation and benefits expense for fiscal  and  respectively are non cash charges of million  million and million associated with the bank s employee stock ownership plan esop and supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
the amounts charged to expense under both the esop and serp move upward or downward with changes in the market price of our common stock 
for the year ended march   esop expense of million was based on  shares being amortized  an average of  shares per quarter 
from april through december   esop expense will be based on a quarterly amortization of approximately  shares a percent reduction from the average quarterly amortization level for fiscal all shares under the current esop will be allocated as of december  we intend to continue our esop beyond calendar by acquiring additional shares and allocating those shares to employees at a level similar to that projected for the april through december period 
marketing and professional services the increase in marketing and professional services expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and million for fiscal was attributable to the marketing efforts associated with new full service branch office openings  an increase in expenditures associated with increased marketing efforts directed toward the hispanic segments of the communities we serve and the costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
other general and administrative expense our other general and administrative expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the million increase between fiscal and was primarily attributable to the following  charge off of a community reinvestment act investment  that was determined to be impaired   increase in office supplies and equipment due to the opening of our three new full service branch offices 
 accrual associated with the filing of amended tax returns  and  increase in correspondent bank service charges resulting from higher volumes of deposit and loan activity 
the million increase between fiscal and was primarily attributable to an increase in correspondent bank service charges and appraisal fees resulting from higher volumes of deposit and loan activity  and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
income taxes income taxes were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the effective income tax rates were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in our effective tax rates were primarily due to the permanent difference 
table of contents associated with our esop  whereby the difference between the fair value of the esop shares allocated each year over the cost basis of those shares is not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes 
in addition to the anticipated decrease in total esop expense resulting from the reduction in shares being amortized  as noted above under compensation and benefits  we expect that the non deductible portion of esop expense will be reduced further beginning january  because there will be a smaller difference between the cost basis of the shares acquired to continue the plan and the fair value of those shares throughout the period 
although many additional factors may influence our future effective tax rates  the anticipated reduction in esop expense beginning april   discussed above is expected to reduce our effective tax rate for fiscal to approximately percent 
assuming the cost basis for new shares acquired to continue the esop beyond december  approximates the average market price of our common stock throughout the fiscal year ending march   we expect our effective tax rate to decrease further to approximately percent for fiscal liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the continuing ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund operations and meet other obligations on a timely and cost effective basis 
our most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at march  cash and short term investments totaled million 
effective july  the ots adopted a rule eliminating the statutory liquidity requirement 
in its place  the ots adopted a policy  consistent with that of the other federal banking regulatory agencies  that liquidity be maintained at a level which provides for safe and sound banking practices and financial flexibility 
our internal policy is to maintain cash and readily marketable debt securities with final maturities of one year or less equal to approximately three percent of total deposits  fhlb advances and other borrowings maturing within one year our defined liquidity ratio 
at march   our defined liquidity ratio was and our average defined liquidity ratio was for the fiscal year ended march  in determining the adequacy of liquidity and borrowing capacity  we also consider large customer deposit concentrations  particularly with respect to core deposits  which provide immediate withdrawal opportunity 
at march   our largest core deposit relationship was million and our ten largest core deposit relationships aggregated million 
as an additional component of liquidity management  we seek to maintain sufficient mortgage and securities collateral at the fhlb to enable us to immediately borrow an amount equal to at least five percent of total assets 
at march   our immediate borrowing capacity was million or of the bank s total assets 
additionally  we have the capability to borrow funds from the federal reserve bank discount window 
as of march   our borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank was approximately million 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  leases and securities  fhlb advances and other borrowings  and to a lesser extent  proceeds from the sale of loans and securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans  leases and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and security prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our strategy is to manage liquidity by investing excess cash flows in higher yielding interest earning assets  such as loans  leases and securities  or paying down fhlb advances and other borrowings  depending on market conditions 
conversely  if the need for funds is not met through deposits and cash flows from loans  leases and securities  we initiate fhlb advances and other borrowings  or if necessary and of economic benefit  sell loans and or securities 
only when no other alternatives exist will we constrain loan originations as a means of addressing a liquidity shortfall 
we have not found it necessary to constrain loan originations due to liquidity considerations 

table of contents our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
this increase in net cash provided by operating activities from million in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to the following items a million increase in net earnings between fiscal and a million smaller decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities during fiscal than during this change was attributable to securities purchased on march  that settled in fiscal and to a shift in our current income tax position from a payable at march  to a receivable at march  a million increase in gains on sale of loans  mortgage backed securities available for sale  real estate and property and equipment between fiscal and the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from million in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to the timing difference relating to securities purchased on march  noted above 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of disbursements for loan and lease originations and purchases and purchases of securities  offset by principal collections on loans  leases and proceeds from maturation and paydowns on securities 
the levels of cash flows from investing activities are influenced by the general level of interest rates 
during periods of declining rates  borrowers generally exhibit an increasing propensity to refinance their indebtedness  which results in a higher turnover of loans and securities 
conversely  during periods of increasing rates  borrowers generally refinance their debt at a much slower pace 
accordingly  we reinvest those cash flows into originations and purchases of loans and purchases of securities in order to effectively manage our cash resources 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities from million in fiscal to million in fiscal was primarily due to the following items a million decrease in purchases of investment securities and mortgage backed securities available for sale  consistent with our strategic de emphasis on securities in our effort to maintain a high proportion of our total interest earnings assets in loans and leases 
a million decrease in proceeds from the sale and maturity of investment securities available for sale 
a million increase in the origination of loans and leases held for investment in fiscal as compared to fiscal  reflecting the strategy noted above 
a million decrease in purchases of loans held for investment reflecting our strategy of placing our loan growth focus on the four cs  as the overwhelming majority of our loan purchases have been in the one to four family residential loan category 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to increases in loan originations and purchases in fiscal as compared to fiscal  partially offset by an increase in loan repayments 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities from million in fiscal to million in fiscal was primarily due to the following items a million decrease in the use of fhlb advances and other borrowings in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents a million greater increase in deposits during fiscal million than during fiscal million and the issuance of million of junior subordinated debentures during fiscal the increase in net cash provided by financing activities from million in fiscal to million in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the use of fhlb advances and other borrowings  a decrease in the purchase of treasury stock and a greater increase in deposits during fiscal than during fiscal deposits  particularly core deposits  provide a more preferable source of funding than do fhlb advances and other borrowings 
however  as and to the extent competitive or market factors do not allow us to meet our funding needs with deposits  fhlb advances and other borrowings provide a readily available source of liquidity 
as of march  and  the bank had maximum borrowing capacity from the fhlb of san francisco of billion and billion  respectively 
based upon pledged collateral in place  the available borrowing capacity was million and million at march  and  respectively 
we also have the ability to borrow funds under reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by securities 
we had zero and million of borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at march  and  respectively 
additionally  we have the capability to borrow funds from the federal reserve bank discount window 
as of march   our borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank was approximately million 
at march   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a tangible capital level of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  core capital of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and total risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
see item business regulation and supervision federal savings institution regulation 
at march   we have no material contractual obligations or commitments for capital expenditures 
on april   the bank entered into an agreement to purchase a building to be used as its corporate headquarters in rancho cucamonga  california 
the purchase price was million and the transaction closed on june  see item business general 
at march   we had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase loans of million and none  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  at march  we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our commitments 
at march   we had no outstanding commitments to purchase securities compared to  of outstanding commitments to purchase securities at march  see item business general 
certificate accounts that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from march  totaled million 
we expect that we will retain a substantial portion of the funds from maturing cds at maturity either in cds or liquid accounts 
the low interest rate environment during fiscal and the early stages of fiscal resulted in a reduction in the differential between cds and more liquid instruments such as money market accounts 
accordingly  a portion of our maturing cds were reinvested by customers into more liquid accounts until such time as the rate differential between cds and liquid accounts increased 
during the later stages of fiscal  in response to the increases in short term interest rates initiated by the federal reserve  as well as competitive market forces  rates on cds have increased disproportionately to those of more liquid accounts 
as a result  we have begun observing early signs of a change in customer behavior back towards cds 
we anticipate that this shift in consumer preference will continue as and to the extent general market conditions create continued widening of the rate differential between cds and liquid accounts 

table of contents contractual obligations and other commitments through the normal course of operations  we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
our obligations generally relate to funding of our operations through deposits and borrowings as well as leases for premises and equipment  and our commitments generally relate to our lending operations 
we have obligations under long term operating leases  principally for building space and land 
lease terms generally cover a five year period  with options to extend  and are non cancelable 
currently  we have no significant vendor contractual obligations 
our commitments to originate fixed and variable rate mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment 
undisbursed loan funds and unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed  but committed to construction projects and home equity and commercial lines of credit 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since some commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the credit risk involved in issuing lines and letters of credit requires the same creditworthiness evaluation as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness 
we receive collateral to support commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
the most significant categories of collateral include real estate properties underlying mortgage loans  liens on personal property and cash on deposits with us

table of contents undisbursed loan commitments balance dollars in thousands construction consumers commercial letter of credit impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts or market value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
segment reporting we provide a broad range of financial services to individuals and companies located primarily in southern california 
these services include demand  time and savings deposits  real estate  business and consumer lending  cash management  trust services  investment advisory services and diversified financial services to homebuilders

off balance sheet arrangements we maintain certain off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we realize income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  leases  investments and other interest earnings assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
loan and lease volumes and yields  as well as the volume and rates on investments  deposits and borrowings  are affected by market interest rates 
additionally  because of the terms and conditions of many of our loan and lease agreements and deposit accounts  a change in rates could also affect the duration of the loan portfolio and or the deposit base  which could alter our sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk management focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits while taking into consideration  among other factors  our overall credit  operating income  operating cost and capital profile 
disclosure related to market risk is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset liability management contained in item of this form k 
financial derivatives it is the policy of the company not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates 
however  the company may enter into financial derivatives in order to seek to mitigate exposure to interest rate risks related to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we believe that these transactions  when properly structured and managed  may provide a hedge against inherent interest rate risk in the company s assets or liabilities and against risk in specific transactions 
in such instances  the company may protect its position through the purchase or sale of interest rate futures contracts for a specific cash or interest rate risk position 
other hedge transactions may be implemented using interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  floors  financial futures  forward rate agreements  and options on futures or bonds 
prior to considering any hedging activities  we seek to analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies 
all hedges will require an assessment of basis risk and must be approved by the company s investment committee 

table of contents the company follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas which established accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives  including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and if so  the type of hedge 
fair value is based on dealer quotes  or quoted prices from instruments with similar characteristics 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reflected in current earnings  together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item if there is a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged 
if there is not a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged  then only the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution in the notional amount of million for a period of years 
this interest rate swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge under sfas and was entered into in connection with the concurrent issuance on september  of the million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures 
see item business sources of funds junior subordinated debentures and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below shows the notional amounts of our interest rate swap maturities and average rates at march  interest rate swap maturities and average rates as of march  fair value dollars in thousands notional amount weighted average rate paid weighted average rate received interest rate received is libor plus basis points
