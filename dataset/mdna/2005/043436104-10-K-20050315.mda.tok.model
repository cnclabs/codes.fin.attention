item business we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states  operating franchises at dealership locations as of december  we offer our customers an extensive range of automotive products and services including new and used vehicles and related financing  vehicle maintenance and repair services  replacement parts and warranty  insurance and extended service contracts 
for the year ended december   our revenues were approximately billion and our net income was approximately million 
we compete in a large and highly fragmented industry comprised of approximately  franchised dealerships 
the us automotive retailing industry is estimated to have annual sales of approximately trillion  with the largest dealer groups generating less than of total revenues and controlling less than of all franchised dealerships 
we believe that further consolidation is likely due to increased capital requirements of dealerships  the number of dealership owners approaching retirement age and the limited number of viable exit strategies for dealership owners 
we also believe that dealership groups with significant equity capital and experience in identifying  acquiring and professionally managing dealerships have the opportunity to acquire additional dealerships 
we intend to continue to seek acquisitions  consistent with our business strategy 
asbury automotive group  inc was incorporated in delaware on february  on march   we effected an initial public offering of our common stock  and our stock was listed on the nyse under the ticker symbol abg on march  our predecessor entity  a limited liability company  was formed in by then current management and ripplewood llc in  an investment fund affiliated with freeman spogli  acquired a significant interest in us 
these groups identified an opportunity to aggregate a number of the nation s top automotive dealers as one cohesive organization 
general description of our operations our dealerships are located in metropolitan markets throughout the united states 
in late  we began the process of reorganizing our retail network 
prior to that time  we had nine regional dealership groups or platforms 
see recent developments below for further discussion on the reorganization 
each platform originally operated as an independent business before being acquired and integrated into our operations and each continues to enjoy high local brand name recognition 
the following is a detailed breakdown of our markets and dealerships as of december  brand names by region date of initial acquisition markets franchises south nalley automotive group september atlanta  ga acura  audi  bmw  chrysler  hino  honda  infiniti  isuzu truck  jaguar  jeep  lexus a  navistar  peterbilt  volvo north point auto group february little rock  ar bmw  ford  hyundai a  lincoln  mazda  mercury  nissan  toyota  volkswagen  volvo florida courtesy autogroup september tampa  fl chrysler  gmc  hyundai  infiniti  jeep  kia  lincoln b  mercedes benz  mercury b  nissan  pontiac  toyota coggin automotive group october jacksonville  fl chevrolet  gmc a  honda a  kia  nissan a  pontiac a  toyota orlando  fl buick  chevrolet  ford  gmc  honda a  lincoln  mercury  pontiac fort pierce  fl bmw  honda  mercedes benz west thomason autogroup december portland  or ford a  gmc b  honda  hyundai a  pontiac b  toyota northern california dealerships april fresno  ca sacramento  ca mercedes benz  nissan mercedes benz spirit automotive group april rancho santa margarita  ca los angeles  ca nissan dodge  honda david mcdavid auto group april dallas fort worth  tx acura  buick  gmc  honda a  lincoln  mercury  pontiac houston  tx honda  nissan austin  tx acura mid atlantic crown automotive company december greensboro  nc acura  bmw  cadillac  chevrolet  chrysler  dodge  gmc  honda  nissan  pontiac  volvo chapel hill  nc honda  volvo fayetteville  nc dodge  ford charlotte  nc honda richmond  va acura  bmw a  mini charlottesville  va bmw  porsche greenville  sc chrysler  jeep  nissan gray daniels auto family april jackson  ms buick  cadillac  chevrolet  chrysler  ford  gmc  jeep  lincoln  mercury  nissan a  pontiac  toyota plaza motor company december st 
louis  mo audi  bmw  cadillac  infiniti  land rover  lexus  mercedes benz  porsche a this market has two of these franchises 
b pending divestitures as of december  in addition to the sale of new and used vehicles  our dealerships offer a wide range of other products and services  including repair and warranty work  replacement parts  extended warranty coverage and finance and insurance products 
new vehicle sales our franchises include a diverse portfolio of american  european and asian brands 
in  we retailed approximately  new vehicles through our dealerships 
new vehicle sales were approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  we believe that our diverse brand  product and price mix enables us to reduce our exposure to specific product supply shortages and changing customer preferences 
please see business strategy focus on premier brand mix  strategic markets and diversification below for a discussion on our diverse offering of brands and products 
our new vehicle retail sales include new vehicle sales  new vehicle retail lease transactions and other similar agreements  which are arranged by our individual dealerships 
due to their terms  new vehicle leases  which are provided by third parties  generally cause customers to return to the market more frequently than in the case of purchased vehicles 
in addition  because third party lessors frequently give our dealerships the first option to purchase vehicles returned by customers at lease end  leases provide us with an additional source of late model vehicles for our used vehicle inventory 
generally  leased vehicles remain under factory warranty for the term of the lease  allowing dealerships to provide repair service to the lessee throughout the lease term 
historically  approximately of our new vehicle sales revenue has been derived from the sale of new vehicles to commercial customers referred to as fleet sales 
used vehicle sales we sell used vehicles at virtually all of our franchised dealerships 
retail sales of used vehicles  which generally have higher gross margins than new vehicles  made up approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  in  we retailed approximately  used vehicles through our dealerships 
profits from the sales of used vehicles are dependent primarily on the ability of our dealerships to obtain a high quality supply of used vehicles and effectively manage inventory 
our new vehicle operations provide our used vehicle operations with a large supply of high quality trade ins and off lease vehicles  which we believe are a good source of attractive used vehicle inventory 
in addition  a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory is purchased at auctions restricted to new vehicle dealers offering off lease  rental and fleet vehicles and open auctions which offer vehicles sold by other dealers and repossessed vehicles 
we sell a majority of our used vehicles to retail customers 
we dispose of used vehicles that are not purchased by retail customers through sales to other dealers and at auctions 
the reconditioning of used vehicles also creates profitable service work for our fixed operations departments 
we intend to grow our used vehicle sales by maintaining high quality inventory across all price ranges  providing competitive prices and extended service contracts and continuing to enhance our marketing initiatives 
based on sharing of best practices among our dealerships  we have regionally centralized used car functions responsible for determining which vehicles to stock at each store 
used vehicles are generally offered at our dealerships for not more than days  after which  if they have not been sold to a retail buyer  they are either sold to an outside dealer or offered at auction 
we may transfer used vehicles among dealerships to provide balanced inventories of used vehicles at each of our dealerships 
we believe that acquisitions of additional dealerships will expand the internal market for the transfer of used vehicles among our dealerships and  therefore  increase the ability of each dealership to offer a balanced mix of used vehicles 
we have taken several steps towards building client confidence in our used vehicle inventory  including participation in the manufacturers certification processes  which is available only to new vehicle franchises 
these processes make certain used vehicles eligible for new vehicle benefits such as new vehicle finance rates and extended manufacturer warranties 
in addition  each dealership offers customers the opportunity to purchase extended warranties  which are provided by third parties  on its used car sales 
parts  service and collision repair we refer to the parts  service and collision repair area of our business as fixed operations 
we sell parts and provide maintenance and repair service at all of our franchised dealerships  primarily for the vehicle brands sold at those dealerships 
in addition  we maintain free standing collision repair centers in close proximity to our dealerships 
our dealerships and collision repair centers collectively operate approximately  service bays 
parts  service and collision repair centers accounted for approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit as of december  historically  fixed operations revenues have been more stable than vehicle sales 
industry wide  parts and service revenues have consistently increased over the last years primarily due to the increased cost of maintaining vehicles  the added technical complexity of vehicles and the increased number of vehicles on the road 
we believe the variety and quality of extended warranty plans available for both new and used vehicles in recent years has seen progressive expansion and improvement 
we believe this trend may also be a contributing factor in our fixed operations revenue growth 
as of december   warranty work accounted for approximately of our parts and service business revenue 
historically  the automotive repair industry has been highly fragmented 
however  we believe that the increased use of advanced technology in vehicles has made it difficult for independent repair shops to have the expertise required to perform major or technical repairs  especially as such repairs relate to luxury and mid line imports which comprise a majority of our new vehicle retail sales 
additionally  many manufacturers require warranty work to be performed only at franchised dealerships 
as a result  unlike independent service stations or independent and superstore used car dealerships with service operations  our franchised dealerships are qualified to perform work covered by manufacturer warranties on increasingly technologically complex motor vehicles 
we use variable rate compensation structures designed to reflect the difficulty and sophistication of different types of repairs to compensate employees working in parts and service 
in addition  the profit percentages for parts vary according to market conditions and type 
one of our major goals is to retain each vehicle purchaser as a long term customer of our parts and service departments 
currently  we estimate that approximately of customers return to our dealerships for other services after the vehicle warranty expires 
therefore we believe that significant opportunity for growth exists in the maintenance services part of our business 
each dealership has systems in place to track customer maintenance records and to notify owners of vehicles purchased at the dealership when their vehicles are due for periodic services 
service and repair activities are an integral part of our overall approach to customer service 
finance and insurance we generally arrange for the financing of the sale or lease of new and used vehicles to customers through third party vendors 
we arranged customer financing with no recourse to us on approximately of the vehicles we sold during the year ended december  these transactions result in commissions being paid to us by the third party lenders  including manufacturer captive finance subsidiaries 
to date  we have entered into preferred lender agreements with lenders 
under the terms of the preferred lender agreements  each lender has agreed to provide a marketing fee to us above the standard commission for each loan that our dealerships place with that lender 
furthermore  many of the insurance products we sell result in additional underwriting profits and investment income yields based on portfolio performance 
we receive highly favorable pricing on these products from our vendors as a result of our size and sales volume 
we earn sales based commissions on substantially all of these products while taking virtually no risk related to loan payments  insurance payments or investment performance  which are generally borne by third parties 
these commissions are subject to cancellation  in certain circumstances  if the customer cancels the contract 
our finance and insurance business generated approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  recent developments in late  we began the process of reorganizing our platforms into principally four regions i florida comprising our coggin dealerships operating primarily in jacksonville and orlando  and our courtesy dealerships operating in tampa  ii west comprising our mcdavid dealerships operating throughout texas  our thomason dealerships operating in portland  oregon  our spirit dealerships operating primarily in los angeles  california and our northern california dealerships  iii mid atlantic comprising our crown dealerships operating in north carolina  south carolina and southern virginia and iv south comprising our nalley dealerships operating in atlanta  georgia  and our north point dealerships operating in little rock  arkansas 
our plaza dealerships in st 
louis  missouri and our gray daniels dealerships operating in jackson  mississippi remain standalone operations 
our decision to reorganize the platforms was based on the belief that there will be a significant increase in management effectiveness  as well as added operating and cost efficiencies 
the reorganization of our platforms does not change the structure of our internal organization in a manner that impacts our reporting in only one segment 
furthermore  there was no change in our financial reporting for as a result of this reorganization 
however  we anticipate that changes in our management  operational and reporting structure  effective as of january  and additional changes to be made in  will ultimately lead us to the determination that goodwill will be evaluated at the operating segment level in the future 
please see our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section below for additional discussion regarding this reorganization 
business strategy focus on premier brand mix  strategic markets and diversification we classify our franchise sales lines into luxury  mid line import  mid line domestic  value and heavy trucks 
luxury and mid line imports together accounted for approximately of our new retail vehicle revenues as of december  and comprised over half of our total franchises 
over the last years  luxury and mid line imports have gained market share at the expense of mid line domestic brands 
generally  luxury and mid line imports generate above average gross margins and greater customer loyalty 
furthermore  customers for these brands tend to service their vehicles more frequently at a franchised dealership than customers of other brands  which makes these brands more profitable from a parts and service perspective 
the following table reflects current franchises and the share of new retail vehicle revenue represented by each class of franchise class franchise number of franchises as of december  of new retail vehicle revenue for the year ended december  luxury bmw acura lincoln a mercedes benz volvo audi cadillac infiniti lexus porsche jaguar land rover total luxury mid line import honda nissan toyota mazda mini volkswagen total mid line import mid line domestic gmc a pontiac a ford chrysler mercury a chevrolet jeep buick dodge total mid line domestic value hyundai kia total value heavy trucks hino isuzu navistar peterbilt total heavy trucks total franchise accounted for less than of new retail vehicle revenue for the year ended december  a includes one pending divestiture as of december  asbury s geographic coverage encompasses different metropolitan markets at locations in states as of december  arkansas  california  florida  georgia  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  oregon  south carolina  texas and virginia 
new vehicle sales revenue is diversified among manufacturers and for the year ended december   consisted of honda  nissan  ford  toyota  mercedes benz  bmw and lexus representing the highest concentrations 
we believe that our broad geographic coverage as well as diversification among manufacturers decreases our exposure to regional economic downturns and manufacturer specific risks such as warranty issues or production disruption 
see risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers adverse conditions affecting one or more manufacturers may negatively impact our profitability for a list of such manufacturer specific risks 
each of our dealerships maintains a strong local brand that has been enhanced through local advertising over many years 
we believe that our cultivation of strong local brands may be beneficial because consumers may prefer to interact with a locally recognized brand 
by placing franchises in one geographic location under a single brand we expect to generate significant advertising savings and retain customers even as they purchase and service different automobile brands 
maintain variable cost structure and emphasize expense control we continually focus on controlling expenses and expanding margins at our existing dealerships and those that are integrated into our operations upon acquisition 
our variable cost structure generally helps us manage expenses in a variety of economic environments  as the majority of our operating expenses consist of incentive based compensation  vehicle carrying costs  advertising and other variable and controllable costs 
the majority of our general manager compensation and virtually all salesperson compensation are tied to profits and profit margins of the dealership 
salespersons  sales managers  service managers  parts managers  service advisors  service technicians and the majority of other non clerical dealership personnel are paid a commission or a modest salary plus commission 
in addition  dealership management compensation is tied to individual dealership profitability 
we believe we can further manage these types of costs through best practices  standardization of compensation plans  controlled oversight and accountability and centralized processing systems 
focus on higher margin products and services while new vehicle sales are critical to drawing customers to our dealerships  used vehicle retail sales  fixed operations and finance and insurance generally provide significantly higher profit margins and account for the majority of our profitability 
in addition  we have discipline specific executives at both the corporate and dealership levels who focus on increasing the penetration of current services and expanding the breadth of our offerings to customers 
while each of our dealerships operates independently in a manner consistent with its specific market s characteristics  each pursues an integrated strategy to grow these higher margin businesses to enhance profitability and stimulate internal growth 
fixed operations 
we offer parts  perform vehicle service work and operate collision repair centers  all of which provide important sources of recurring revenue with high gross profit margins 
for the year ended december   gross profits from these businesses absorbed approximately of our total operating expenses  including corporate office expenses and excluding salespersons compensation 
we intend to continue to grow this higher margin business and increase this cost absorption rate by adding new service bays  increasing capacity utilization of existing service bays and ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction within our parts  service and collision repair operations 
in addition  given the increased sophistication of vehicles  our repair operations provide detailed expertise and state of the art diagnostic equipment that we believe independent repair shops cannot adequately provide 
our repair operations also provide manufacturer warranty work that must be done at certified franchise dealerships  rather than through independent dealers 
finance and insurance 
we intend to continue to bolster our finance and insurance revenues by offering a broad range of conventional finance and lease alternatives to fund the purchase of new and used vehicles 
in addition to offering these third party financing products  we intend to expand our already broad offering of third party products such as credit insurance  extended service contracts  maintenance programs and a host of other niche products to meet all of our customer needs on a one stop shopping basis 
moreover  continued in depth sales training efforts and innovative computer technologies will serve as important tools in growing our finance and insurance profitability 
we have increased platform finance and insurance revenue per vehicle retailed to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reconciliation of non gaap financial information 
we have successfully increased our platform finance and insurance revenue per vehicle retailed each year since our inception 
local management of dealership operations and centralized administrative and strategic functions we believe that local management of dealership operations enables our retail network to provide market specific responses to sales  customer service and inventory requirements 
our dealerships are operated as distinct profit centers in which the general managers are responsible for the operations  personnel and financial performance of their dealerships as well as other day to day operations 
our local management teams familiarity with their markets enables them to effectively run day to day operations  market to customers  recruit new employees and gauge acquisition opportunities in these markets 
the general manager of each dealership is supported by a management team consisting  in most cases  of a new vehicle sales manager  a used vehicle sales manager  a finance and insurance manager  a parts manager and service managers 
we have a management structure that is intended to promote and reward entrepreneurial spirit and the achievement of team goals and is complemented by regionally centralized technology and financial controls  as well as sharing best practices and market intelligence throughout the organization 
see experienced and incentivized corporate and dealership management below for a discussion of the incentive based pay system for management at our corporate office and at our dealerships 
we employ professional management practices in all aspects of our operations  including information technology and employee training 
our dealership operations are complemented by regionally centralized technology and strategic and financial controls  as well as shared market intelligence throughout the organization 
corporate and dealership management utilize computer based management information systems to monitor each dealership s sales  profitability and inventory on a regular basis 
we believe the application of professional management practices provides us with a competitive advantage over many independent dealerships 
in addition  the corporate headquarters coordinates a peer review process in which regional dealership management formulates goals and addresses best practices  operational challenges and successes for other dealerships in our retail network 
on a rotating basis  each regional group s operations are examined in detail by management from other regions 
through this process  we identify areas for improvement and disseminate best practices company wide 
our corporate headquarters are located in new york  new york 
the corporate office is responsible for the capital structure of the business and its expansion and operating strategy 
the implementation of our operational strategy rests with each dealership management team based on the policies and procedures set forth by the corporate office 
experienced and incentivized corporate and dealership management we have a management team with extensive experience and expertise in the retail and automotive sectors 
kenneth b 
gilman  our president and chief executive officer  served for years at limited brands formerly  the limited  inc where his last assignment was as chief executive officer of lane bryant  a retailer of women s clothing and a subsidiary of limited brands 
from to  mr 
gilman served as vice chairman and chief administrative officer of limited brands with responsibility for  among other things  finance  information technology  supply chain management and production 
robert d 
frank  our senior vice president of automotive operations  has spent most of his year career working in all aspects of automotive operations  including serving from to as chief operating officer of the larry h

gordon smith has served as our senior vice president and chief financial officer since september he joined us following over years with general electric company ge 
during his last twelve years at ge he served as chief financial officer for three of ge s commercial finance businesses corporate financial services  commercial equipment finance and capital markets 
furthermore  we believe that our leadership at the store level represents some of the best talent in the industry 
our regional chief executive officers and store general managers are proven leaders in their local markets and have many years of experience in the automotive retail industry 
in addition  our continued focus on college recruiting  training  development  and retention is designed to maintain our talented management pool 
we tie compensation of our senior dealership management to performance by relying upon an incentive based pay system 
we compensate our general managers based on dealership profitability  and our department managers and salespeople are similarly compensated based upon departmental profitability and individual performance 
continued growth through targeted acquisitions we intend to continue to grow through acquisitions 
we will pursue tuck in acquisitions to complement our current dealerships by increasing brand diversity  market coverage and products and services offered 
we will also seek to establish a presence in new markets through the purchase of multiple individual franchises or through the acquisition of large  profitable and well managed dealership groups with leading market positions 
tuck in acquisitions 
one of our goals is to become the market leader in every region in which we operate 
we plan to acquire additional dealerships in each of the markets in which we operate to increase our brand mix  products and services offered in that market 
tuck in acquisitions are typically re branded immediately and operate thereafter under the respective local brand name 
we believe that these acquisitions have facilitated  and will continue to facilitate  our regional operating efficiencies and cost savings 
in addition  we have generally been able to improve the gross profit of tuck in dealerships within twelve months following an acquisition 
we believe this is due to improvements in the number of finance and insurance products sold per vehicle retailed  greater utilization of service bays  improved management practices and enhanced unit sales volumes related to the strength of our local brand names 
platform acquisitions 
we will seek to establish a presence in new geographic markets through multiple purchases of individual franchises over time  or through acquisitions of large  profitable and well managed dealership groups with leading market positions 
we target metropolitan and high growth suburban markets in which we are not currently present and platforms with superior operational and financial management personnel 
we believe that the retention of existing high quality management who understand the local market enables acquired platforms to continue to operate efficiently  while allowing us to effectively expand our operations through future acquisitions without having to employ and train new personnel 
we also believe retention of the local  established brand name is important to attracting a broad and loyal customer base 
we believe we are able to pursue larger  established acquisition candidates as a result of our platform management retention strategies  the reputation of our existing and former platform managers as leaders in the automotive retailing industry  our size and our financial resources 
focus on acquisitions providing geographic and brand diversity 
by focusing on geographic and brand diversity  we seek to manage economic risk and drive growth and profitability 
by having a presence in all major brands and by avoiding concentration with one manufacturer  we are well positioned to reduce our exposure to specific product supply shortages and changing customer preferences 
at the same time  we will seek to continue to increase the proportion of our dealerships that are in markets with favorable demographic characteristics or that are franchises of fast growing  high margin brands 
commitment to customer service we are focused on providing a high level of customer service to meet the needs of an increasingly sophisticated and demanding automotive consumer 
we attempt to design our dealership service to meet the needs of our customers and establish relationships that will result in both repeat business and additional business through customer referrals 
furthermore  we incentivize our dealership managers to employ more efficient selling approaches  engage in extensive follow up to develop long term relationships with customers and extensively train our sales staff to be able to meet customer needs 
we continually evaluate innovative ways to improve the buying experience for our customers and believe that our ability to share best practices across our dealerships gives us an advantage over independent dealerships 
in addition  our dealerships regard service and repair operations as an integral part of the overall approach to customer service  providing an opportunity to foster ongoing relationships with customers and deepen loyalty 
marketing our advertising and marketing efforts are focused at the local market level  with the aim of building our business with a broad base of repeat  referral and new customers 
our primary advertising medium is local newspapers  followed by radio  television  direct mail  the internet and the yellow pages 
the retail automotive industry has traditionally used locally produced  largely non professional materials  often developed under the direction of each dealership s general manager 
we have created common marketing materials for our brand names using professional advertising agencies 
our sales and marketing department helps oversee and share creative materials and general marketing best practices across our dealerships 
our total company marketing expense was million for the year ended december   which translates into an average of per retail vehicle sold 
in addition  manufacturers direct advertising spending in support of their brands has been historically a significant component of the total amount spent on new car advertising in the united states 
management information systems we consolidate financial  accounting and operational data received from our dealers nationwide through an exclusive private communication network 
the data from the dealers is gathered and processed through their individual dealer management system 
our dealers use software from adp  inc  reynolds reynolds  co 
or ucs  inc as their dealer management system 
our systems approach allows us to choose the dealer management system that best fit our daily operational needs 
we aggregate the information from the dealer systems at our corporate headquarters to create one single view of the business using hyperion financial products 
our information technology approach enables us to quickly integrate and aggregate the information from a new acquisition 
by creating a connection over our private network between the dealer management system and corporate hyperion financial products  corporate management can quickly view the financial  accounting and operational data of the newly acquired dealer 
therefore  we are able to efficiently integrate the acquired dealer into our operations 
hyperion s products allow us to easily and quickly review operating and financial data at a variety of levels 
for example  from our headquarters  management can review the performance of any specific department eg  parts and services at any particular dealership 
this system also allows us to quickly compile and monitor our consolidated financial results 
competition in new vehicle sales  our dealerships compete primarily with other franchised dealerships in their regions 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from the manufacturers 
instead  we rely on advertising and merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation  strong local brand names and location of our dealerships to sell new vehicles 
in recent years  automobile dealers have also faced increased competition in the sale or lease of new vehicles from independent leasing companies  on line purchasing services and warehouse clubs 
our used vehicle operations compete with other franchised dealers  independent used car dealers  automobile rental agencies and private parties for supply and resale of used vehicles 
see risk factors risks related to competition substantial competition in automobile sales may adversely affect our profitability 
we compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty repairs and with other automobile dealers  franchised and independent service centers for non warranty repair and routine maintenance business 
we compete with other automobile dealers  service stores and auto parts retailers in our parts operations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are the use of factory approved replacement parts  price  the familiarity with a manufacturer s brands and models  and the quality of customer service 
a number of regional and national chains as well as some competing franchised dealers may offer certain parts and services at prices that may be lower than our prices 
in arranging financing for our customers vehicle purchases  we compete with a broad range of financial institutions 
in addition  financial institutions are now offering finance and insurance products through the internet  which may reduce our profits on these items 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in providing financing are convenience  interest rates and flexibility in contract length 
in the acquisition area  we compete with other national dealer groups and individual investors for acquisitions 
some of our competitors may have greater financial resources and competition may increase acquisition pricing 
dealer and framework agreements each of our dealerships operates pursuant to a dealer agreement between the dealership and the manufacturer or in some cases the distributor of each brand of new vehicles sold at the dealership 
in addition  in connection with our heavy trucks business in atlanta  georgia  certain dealerships have entered into dealer agreements pursuant to which they provide factory authorized service and warranty repairs on vehicle brands that they are not also authorized to sell 
our typical dealer agreement specifies the locations at which the dealer has the right and obligation to sell the manufacturer s vehicles and related parts and products and or to perform certain approved services and governs the use of the manufacturer s trademarks and service marks 
the allocation of new vehicles among dealerships is subject to the discretion of the manufacturer  and generally does not guarantee the dealership exclusivity within a given territory 
most dealer agreements impose requirements on virtually every aspect of the dealer s operations 
for example  most of our dealer agreements contain provisions and standards related to inventories of new vehicles and manufacturer replacement parts  the maintenance of minimum net working capital and in some cases minimum net worth  the achievement of certain sales and customer satisfaction targets  advertising and marketing practices  facilities  signs  products offered to customers  dealership management  personnel training  information systems and dealership monthly and annual financial reporting 
in addition to requirements under dealer agreements  we are subject to additional provisions contained in supplemental agreements  framework agreements  dealer addenda and manufacturers policies  collectively referred to as framework agreements 
framework agreements impose additional requirements similar to those discussed above 
such agreements also define other standards and limitations including company wide performance criteria  capitalization requirements  limitations on changes in our ownership or management  limitations on the number of a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us  restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to pledge the stock of certain of our subsidiaries or have these subsidiaries guarantee payment of certain obligations  and conditions for consent to proposed acquisitions  including limitations on the total local  regional and national market share percentage that would be represented by a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us after giving effect to a proposed acquisition 
some dealer agreements and framework agreements grant the manufacturer the right to purchase its dealerships from us under certain additional circumstances  including the dealerships failure to meet the manufacturer s capitalization or working capital requirements or operating guidelines  our failure to meet certain financial requirements  the occurrence of an extraordinary corporate transaction at our parent entity level or dealership operating entity level without the manufacturer s prior consent  a material breach of the framework agreement  or acceleration of obligations under our credit facility the committed credit facility with ford motor credit company  general motors acceptance corporation and daimlerchrysler services north america  llc the lenders  our senior subordinated notes due or our senior subordinated notes due some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements also give the manufacturer a right of first refusal if we propose to sell any dealership representing the manufacturer s brands to a third party 
these agreements may also attempt to limit the protections available under state dealer laws and require us to resolve disputes through binding arbitration 
provisions for termination or non renewal of dealer and framework agreements 
certain of our dealer agreements expire after a specified period of time  ranging from one year to six years  while other of our agreements have a perpetual term 
we expect to renew expiring agreements in the ordinary course of business 
however  typical dealer agreements provide for termination or non renewal by the manufacturer under certain circumstances  including insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealership  failure to adequately operate the dealership or to maintain required capitalization levels  impairment of the reputation or financial condition of the dealership  change of control of the dealership without manufacturer approval  failure to complete facility upgrades required by the manufacturer or agreed to by the dealer  or material breach of other provisions of a dealer agreement 
see risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer agreements on favorable terms  if certain of our franchises are terminated  or if certain manufacturers rights under their agreements with us are triggered  our operations may be adversely affected  for a further discussion of the risks related to the termination or non renewal of our dealer and framework agreements 
manufacturers limitations on acquisitions 
our dealer agreements and framework agreements typically require us to maintain certain performance standards and obtain the consent of the applicable manufacturer before we can acquire any additional dealership franchises 
a majority of these agreements impose limits on the number of dealerships we are permitted to own at the metropolitan  regional and national levels 
these limits vary according to the agreements we have with each of the manufacturers but are generally based on fixed numerical limits or on a fixed percentage of the aggregate sales of the manufacturer 
under our current framework and dealer agreements  we are close to our franchise ceiling with toyota  lexus  jaguar and acura 
as a result of certain performance deficiencies asserted by ford  we are currently ineligible to acquire additional ford dealerships and we do not anticipate regaining such eligibility any time in the foreseeable future 
however  we do not believe our inability to acquire additional ford dealerships will have a material affect on our business 
from time to time certain other manufacturers also assert sales and customer satisfaction and other deficiencies at certain of our dealerships causing us to be ineligible to acquire certain additional dealerships until such deficiencies have been remedied or relief from such requirements can be negotiated 
it is our practice to cooperate with these manufacturers to correct the asserted performance and other issues  including at times entering into supplemental action plan agreements detailing the steps we will take and in some cases specifying the timeframes in which we plan to achieve improved performance at these dealerships 
unless we negotiate favorable terms with  or receive the consent of  the manufacturers  we may be prevented from making further acquisitions upon reaching the limits or if we fail to maintain performance standards provided for in the framework agreements

we operate in states that have state dealer laws limiting manufacturers ability to terminate dealer agreements 
however  some framework agreements attempt to limit the protection of state dealer laws 
we are basing the following discussion of state dealer laws on our understanding of these laws 
furthermore  we cannot predict to what degree we will be entitled to state dealer law protections as a result of provisions in our framework agreements that purport to limit our state law rights 
state dealer laws generally provide that it is a violation for manufacturers to terminate or refuse to renew dealer agreements unless they provide written notice to the dealers setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or nonrenewal 
state dealer laws typically require reasonable advance notice to dealers prior to termination or nonrenewal of a dealer agreement 
some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions within the notice period and allow dealers an opportunity to cure non compliance with the manufacturers criteria 
these statutes also provide that manufacturers are prohibited from unreasonably withholding approval for a proposed change in ownership of the dealership 
in several states  acceptable grounds for disapproval are limited to material reasons relating to the character  financial ability or business experience of the proposed transferee and may also include current performance of the proposed transferee in operating other dealerships of the same manufacturer 
see risk factors risks related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers if state dealer laws are repealed or weakened or superceded by our framework agreements with manufacturers  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements 
governmental regulations we are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulations governing our marketing  advertising  selling  leasing  financing and servicing of motor vehicles and related products 
our dealerships also are subject to state laws and regulations generally relating to corporate entities 
under various state laws  each of our dealerships must obtain a license in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or provide certain automotive repair services 
these laws also regulate conduct of our businesses  including advertising and sales practices 
other states into which we may expand our operations in the future are likely to have similar requirements 
the sales of financing products to our customers are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding truth in lending  deceptive and unfair trade practices  leasing  equal credit opportunity  motor vehicle finance  installment sales  insurance and usury 
some states regulate finance fees and other charges that may be charged in connection with vehicle sales 
penalties for violation of any of these laws or regulations may include revocation of necessary licenses  injunctive relief  assessment of criminal and civil fines and penalties  and in certain instances  create a private cause of action for individuals 
we believe that we comply substantially with all laws and regulations affecting our business and do not have any material liabilities under such laws and regulations and that compliance with all such laws and regulations will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
see risk factors other risks related to our business governmental regulations and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
environmental matters we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  the handling and disposal of wastes and the remediation of contamination 
as with automobile dealerships generally  and service and parts and collision repair center operations in particular  our business involves the generation  use  handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances and wastes 
operations involving the management of wastes are subject to requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state statutes 
pursuant to these laws  federal and state environmental agencies have established approved methods for handling  storage  treatment  transportation and disposal of regulated substances and wastes with which we must comply 
our business also involves the use of above ground and underground storage tanks 
under applicable laws and regulations  we are responsible for the proper use  maintenance and abandonment of our regulated storage tanks and for remediation of subsurface soils and groundwater impacted by releases from existing or abandoned storage tanks 
in addition to these regulated tanks  we own  operate  or have otherwise closed in place other underground and above ground devices or containers such as automotive lifts and service pits that may not be classified as regulated tanks  but which could or may have released stored materials into the environment  thereby potentially obligating us to clean up any soils or groundwater resulting from such releases 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at or from our facilities or to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on those that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance 
responsible parties include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at such sites 
these responsible parties may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances 
currently  we are not subject to any material superfund liabilities 
further  the federal clean water act and comparable state statutes prohibit discharges of pollutants into regulated waters without the necessary permits  require containment of potential discharges of oil or hazardous substances and require preparation of spill contingency plans 
we believe that we are in material compliance with those wastewater discharge requirements as well as requirements for the containment of potential discharges and spill contingency planning 
environmental laws and regulations are very complex and it has become difficult for businesses that routinely handle hazardous and non hazardous wastes to achieve and maintain full compliance with all applicable environmental laws 
from time to time we experience incidents and encounter conditions that will not be in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
however  none of our dealerships has been subject to any material environmental liabilities in the past  nor do we know of any fact or condition that would result in any material environmental liabilities being incurred in the future 
nevertheless  environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement are changed frequently and we believe that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations is likely to continue 
hence  there can be no assurance that compliance with environmental laws or regulations or the future discovery of unknown environmental conditions will not require additional expenditures by us  or that such expenditures would not be material 
see risk factors other risks related to our business governmental regulations and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  persons 
we believe our relationship with our employees is favorable 
currently  certain employees of one of our dealerships are represented by a labor union 
in the future  we may acquire additional businesses that have unionized employees 
certain of our facilities are located in areas of high union concentration  and such facilities are susceptible to union organizing activity 
in addition  because of our dependence on vehicle manufacturers  we may be affected adversely by labor strikes  work slowdowns and walkouts at vehicle manufacturers production facilities and transportation modes 
insurance because of their vehicle inventory and nature of business  automobile retail dealerships generally require significant levels of insurance covering a broad variety of risks 
our insurance program includes multiple umbrella policies with a total per occurrence and aggregate limit of million 
we also have directors and officers insurance  real property insurance  comprehensive coverage for our vehicle inventory  garage liability  general liability insurance and employee dishonesty insurance 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  you should consider carefully the following risk factors when evaluating our business 
risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer agreements on favorable terms  if certain of our franchises are terminated  or if certain manufacturers rights under their agreements with us are triggered  our operations may be adversely affected 
each of our dealerships operates under the terms of a dealer agreement with the manufacturer or manufacturer authorized distributor of each new vehicle brand it carries 
our dealerships may obtain new vehicles from manufacturers  sell new vehicles and display vehicle manufacturers trademarks only to the extent permitted under dealer agreements 
as a result of the terms of our dealer agreements and our dependence on these franchise rights  manufacturers exercise a great deal of control over our day to day operations and the terms of our dealer agreements govern key aspects of our operations  acquisition strategy and capital spending 
most of our dealer agreements provide the manufacturer with the right to terminate the agreement or refuse to renew it after the expiration of the term of the agreement under specified circumstances 
we cannot assure you we will be able to renew any of our existing dealer agreements or that we will be able to obtain renewals on favorable terms 
specifically  many of our dealer agreements provide that the manufacturer may terminate the agreement or direct us to divest the subject dealership if there is a change of control of the dealership 
some of our dealer agreements also provide the manufacturer with the right of first refusal to purchase from us any franchise we seek to sell 
provisions such as these may provide manufacturers with superior bargaining positions in the event that they seek to terminate our dealer agreements or renegotiate the agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent that our franchise rights become compromised or our operations restricted due to the terms of our dealer agreements or if we lose franchises representing a significant source of our revenues 
in addition  we have agreements with toyota which provide that in the event that our payment obligations under our committed credit facility or our senior subordinated notes due the notes are accelerated or demand for payment is made under our subsidiaries guarantees of the committed credit facility or our notes  toyota will have the right to purchase our toyota and lexus dealerships for cash at their fair market value  unless the acceleration or demand is waived within a cure period of no less than days after toyota s notification of its intent to exercise its right to purchase 
if fair market value cannot be agreed by the parties  it will be determined by an independent nationally recognized and experienced appraiser 
we also have an agreement with ford that provides if any of the lenders of our committed credit facility or floor plan facilities accelerate those payment obligations  or if we are notified of any default under our committed credit facility  then ford may exercise its right to acquire our ford  lincoln and mercury dealerships for their fair market value 
our failure to meet manufacturer consumer satisfaction  financial or sales performance requirements may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships and our profitability 
many manufacturers attempt to measure customers satisfaction with their experience in our sales and service departments through rating systems that are generally known as consumer satisfaction indexes csi  augmenting manufacturers monitoring of dealerships financial and sales performance 
at the time we acquire a dealership or enter into a new dealership or framework agreement  several manufacturers establish certain sales or performance criteria for that dealership  in some cases in the form of a business plan 
in the event that that dealership is unable to meet these goals  we may be prevented from making future acquisitions  which would have an adverse effect on our ability to grow 
manufacturers may use these performance indicators  as well as sales performance numbers  as factors in evaluating applications for acquisitions 
the components of these performance indicators have been modified by various manufacturers from time to time in the past  and we cannot assure you that these components will not be further modified or replaced by different systems in the future 
some of our dealerships have had difficulty from time to time meeting these standards 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these standards in the future 
a manufacturer may refuse to consent to our acquisition of one of its franchises if it determines our dealerships do not comply with its performance standards 
this may impede our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
in addition  we receive payments from certain manufacturers based  in part  on csi scores  and future payments may be materially reduced or eliminated if our csi scores decline 
manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions may limit our future growth 
we are generally required to obtain manufacturer consent before we can acquire any additional dealerships 
in addition  many of our dealer and framework agreements require that we meet certain customer service and sales performance standards as a condition to additional dealership acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will meet these performance standards and that manufacturers will consent to future acquisitions  which may deter us from being able to take advantage of market opportunities and restrict our ability to expand our business 
the process of applying for and obtaining manufacturer consents can take a significant amount of time  generally to days or more 
delays in consummating acquisitions caused by this process may negatively affect our ability to acquire dealerships that we believe will produce acquisition synergies and integrate well to our overall growth strategy 
in addition  manufacturers typically establish minimum capital requirements for each of their dealerships on a case by case basis 
as a condition to granting consent to a proposed acquisition  a manufacturer may require us to remodel and upgrade our facilities and capitalize the subject dealership at levels we would not otherwise choose  causing us to divert our financial resources from uses that management believes may be of higher long term value to us 
furthermore  the exercise by manufacturers of their right of first refusal to acquire a dealership may prevent us from acquiring dealerships that we have identified as important to our growth  thereby having an adverse affect on our business 
many vehicle manufacturers place limits on the total number of franchises that any group of affiliated dealerships may obtain 
certain manufacturers place limits on the number of franchises or share of total brand vehicle sales maintained by an affiliated dealership group on a national  regional or local basis 
manufacturers may also tailor these types of restrictions to particular dealership groups 
because of our current franchise mix  we are close to our franchise ceilings with toyota  lexus  acura and jaguar 
if we reach these franchise ceilings discussed above  we may be prevented from making further acquisitions  which could affect our growth 
while we have not reached a numerical limit with ford  we have a dispute over whether our performance should limit additional acquisitions at this time 
however  we do not believe our inability to acquire additional ford dealerships will have a material affect on our business 
if state dealer laws are repealed  weakened or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements 
state dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
though unsuccessful to date  manufacturers lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of state dealer laws 
we have framework agreements with certain of our manufacturers 
among other provisions  these agreements attempt to limit the protections available to dealers under state dealer laws 
if dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice  an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of state dealer laws  it may also be more difficult for our dealers to renew their dealer agreements upon expiration 
in addition  in some states these laws restrict the ability of automobile manufacturers to compete directly in the retail market 
if manufacturers obtain the ability to directly retail vehicles and do so in our markets  such competition could have a material adverse effect on us 
see business dealer and framework agreements state dealer laws 
manufacturers restrictions regarding a change in our stock ownership may result in the termination or forced sale of our franchises  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
some of our dealer agreements with manufacturers prohibit transfers of any ownership interests of a dealership or  in some cases  its parent  without manufacturer consent 
our agreements with several manufacturers provide that  under certain circumstances  we may lose either through termination or forced sale the franchise if a person or entity acquires an ownership interest in us above a specified level ranging from to depending on the particular manufacturer s restrictions or if a person or entity acquires the right to vote or more of our common stock without the approval of the applicable manufacturer 
this trigger level can fall to as low as if another vehicle manufacturer or a person with a criminal record is the entity acquiring the ownership interest or voting rights 
one manufacturer  toyota  in addition to imposing the restrictions previously mentioned  provides that we may be required to sell our toyota franchises including lexus if without its consent the owners of our equity prior to our initial public offering cease to control a majority of our voting stock or if timothy c 
collins ceases to indirectly control us 
violations by our stockholders of these ownership restrictions are generally outside of our control and may result in the termination or non renewal of our dealer and framework agreements or forced sale of one or more franchises  which may have a material adverse effect on us 
these restrictions may also prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and  therefore  may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
our dealers depend upon vehicle sales and  therefore  their success depends in large part upon customer demand for the particular vehicle lines they carry 
the success of our dealerships depends in large part on the overall success of the vehicle lines they carry 
new vehicle sales generate the majority of our total revenue and lead to sales of higher margin products and services such as finance and insurance products and parts and service operations 
although we have sought to limit our dependence on any one vehicle brand  we have focused our new vehicle sales operations in mid line import and luxury brands 
for the year ended december   brands representing or more of our revenues from new vehicle retail sales were as follows brand of total new vehicle retail sales honda nissan ford toyota mercedes benz bmw lexus no other brand accounted for more than of our total new vehicle retail sales revenue for the year ended december  if we fail to obtain a desirable mix of popular new vehicles from manufacturers  our profitability will be negatively impacted 
we depend on manufacturers to provide us with a desirable mix of popular new vehicles 
typically  popular vehicles produce the highest profit margins but tend to be the most difficult to obtain from manufacturers 
manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles among their franchised dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership 
if our dealerships experience prolonged sales slumps  those manufacturers will cut back their allotments of popular vehicles to our dealerships and new vehicle sales and profits may decline 
if automobile manufacturers discontinue incentive programs  our sales volumes may be materially and adversely affected 
our dealerships depend on manufacturers for certain sales incentives  warranties and other programs that are intended to promote and support new vehicle sales 
manufacturers often make many changes to their incentive programs during each year 
some key incentive programs include customer rebates on new vehicles  dealer incentives on new vehicles  special financing or leasing terms  and warranties on new and used vehicles 
a reduction or discontinuation of key manufacturers incentive programs may reduce our new vehicle sales volume resulting in decreased vehicle sales and related revenues 
adverse conditions affecting one or more manufacturers may negatively impact our profitability 
the success of each of our dealerships depends to a great extent on vehicle manufacturers financial condition  marketing efforts  vehicle design  production capabilities  reputation  management  and labor relations 
adverse conditions affecting these and other important aspects of manufacturers operations and public relations may adversely affect our ability to market their automobiles to the public and  as a result  significantly and detrimentally affect our profitability 
risks related to our acquisition strategy if we are unable to acquire and successfully integrate additional dealerships  we will be unable to realize desired results from our growth through acquisition strategy and acquired operations will drain resources from comparatively profitable operations 
we believe that the automobile retailing industry is a mature industry in which we expect relatively slow growth in industry unit sales 
accordingly  we believe that our future growth depends in large part on our ability to acquire additional dealerships  manage expansion  control costs in our operations and consolidate acquired dealerships into our organization 
in pursuing our strategy of acquiring other dealerships  we face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions 
these risks include  but are not limited to failing to obtain manufacturers consents to acquisitions of additional franchises  incurring significant transaction related costs for both completed and failed acquisitions  incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses  failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships  incurring undiscovered liabilities at acquired dealerships  disrupting our ongoing business and diverting our management resources  impairing relationships with employees  manufacturers and customers as a result of changes in management  and incorrectly valuing acquired entities 
we may not adequately anticipate all the demands that our growth will impose on our personnel  procedures and structures  including our financial and reporting control systems  data processing systems and management structure 
moreover  our failure to retain qualified management personnel at any acquired dealership may increase the risk associated with integrating the acquired dealership 
if we cannot adequately anticipate and respond to these demands  we may fail to realize acquisition synergies and our resources will be focused on incorporating new operations into our structure rather than on areas that may be more profitable 
if we incorrectly value acquisition targets or fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses we may be required to take write downs of the goodwill attributed to the acquired businesses  which could be significant 
see risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions may limit our future growth 
we may be unable to capitalize on acquisition opportunities because of financing constraints 
we have substantial indebtedness and  as a result  significant debt service obligations 
our substantial indebtedness could limit the future availability of debt financing to fund acquisitions 
we would like the ability to finance our platform acquisitions in part by issuing shares of our common stock 
the extent to which we will be able or willing to issue common stock for acquisitions will depend on the market value of our common stock from time to time and the willingness of potential acquisition candidates to accept common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses 
we may also be prevented from issuing shares of common stock to finance acquisitions because of manufacturers stock ownership restrictions under our dealer agreements 
see risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers manufacturers restrictions regarding a change in our stock ownership may result in the termination or forced sale of our franchises  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional capital in the future by issuing stock or additional debt securities  and using cash to complete acquisitions may substantially limit our operating or financial flexibility or our ability to meet our debt service obligations 
furthermore  if we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms  we may be required to reduce the scope of our presently anticipated expansion  which may materially and adversely affect our growth strategy 
the competition with other dealer groups to acquire automotive dealerships is intense  and we may not be able to fully implement our growth through acquisition strategy if attractive targets are acquired by competing groups or priced out of our reach due to competitive pressures 
we believe that the united states automotive retailing market is fragmented and offers many potential acquisition candidates that meet our targeting criteria 
however  we compete with several other national  regional and local dealer groups  some of which may have greater financial and other resources 
competition with existing dealer groups and dealer groups formed in the future for attractive acquisition targets may result in fewer acquisition opportunities and increased acquisition costs 
we will have to forego acquisition opportunities to the extent that we cannot negotiate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
risks related to competition substantial competition in automobile sales and services may adversely affect our profitability 
the automotive retailing and servicing industry is highly competitive with respect to price  service  location and selection 
our competition includes franchised automobile dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles that we offer  other national or regional affiliated groups of franchised dealerships  privately negotiated sales of used vehicles  internet based vehicle brokers that sell vehicles obtained from franchised dealers directly to consumers  sales of used vehicles by rental car companies  service center chain stores  and independent service and repair shops 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers 
we typically rely on advertising  merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation and dealership location to sell new and used vehicles 
our dealer agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer s product within a given geographic area 
our revenues or profitability may be materially and adversely affected if competing dealerships expand their market share or are awarded additional franchises by manufacturers that supply our dealerships 
risks related to the automotive industry our business will be harmed if overall consumer demand suffers from a severe or sustained downturn 
our business is heavily dependent on consumer demand and preferences 
our revenues will be materially and adversely affected if there is a severe or sustained downturn in overall levels of consumer spending 
retail vehicle sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
these cycles are often dependent on general economic conditions and consumer confidence  as well as the level of discretionary personal income  credit availability and interest rates 
future recessions may have a material adverse effect on our retail business  particularly sales of new and used automobiles 
in addition  severe or sustained increases in gasoline prices may lead to a reduction in automobile purchases or a shift in buying patterns from luxury suv models which typically provide higher profit margins to retailers to smaller  more economical vehicles which typically have lower margins 
our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in our local markets  even if those conditions are not prominent nationally 
our performance is also subject to local economic  competitive and other conditions prevailing in our various geographic areas 
our dealerships currently are located in the atlanta  austin  chapel hill  charlotte  charlottesville  dallas fort worth  fayetteville  fort pierce  fresno  greensboro  greenville  houston  jackson  jacksonville  little rock  los angeles  orlando  portland  rancho santa margarita  richmond  sacramento  st 
louis and tampa markets and our results of operations therefore depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending levels in those areas 
the seasonality of the automobile retail business magnifies the importance of our second and third quarter results 
the automobile industry is subject to seasonal variations in revenues 
demand for automobiles is generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters than in our second and third quarters 
if conditions surface during the second or third quarters that retard automotive sales  such as severe weather in the geographic areas in which our dealerships operate  war  high fuel costs  depressed economic conditions or similar adverse conditions  our revenues for the year will be disproportionately adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions and foreign trade risks that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles or parts profitably 
a significant portion of our new vehicle business involves the sale of vehicles  parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  our operations are subject to customary risks of importing merchandise  including fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  import duties  exchange controls  trade restrictions  work stoppages and general political and socio economic conditions in other countries 
the united states or the countries from which our products are imported may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adjust presently prevailing quotas  duties or tariffs  which may affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and or parts at reasonable prices 
other risks related to our business our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and adversely impact our compliance with our committed credit facility and other debt covenants 
we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total debt of million  excluding floor plan notes payable 
in addition  we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt from time to time to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes  subject to the restrictions contained in our committed credit facility and the indentures governing our notes and our senior subordinated notes due the notes 
we will have substantial debt service obligations  consisting of required cash payments of principal and interest  for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our debt instruments  including our committed credit facility and the indentures under our notes and our notes may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue certain business activities 
in particular  our committed credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of the covenants in our debt instruments or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in the event of any default under our committed credit facility  the lenders thereunder could accelerate the payment of all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees  and require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings or prevent us from making debt service payments on our notes and our notes  any of which would be an event of default under the respective indentures for such notes 
our substantial debt service obligations could increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 
our capital costs and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment 
we generally finance our purchases of new vehicle inventory and have the ability to finance the purchase of used vehicle inventory using floor plan credit facilities under which we are charged interest at floating rates 
in addition  we obtain capital for general corporate purposes  dealership acquisitions and real estate purchases and improvements under predominantly floating interest rate credit facilities 
therefore  excluding the potential mitigating effects from interest rate hedging techniques  our interest expenses will rise with increases in interest rates 
rising interest rates are generally associated with increasing macroeconomic business activity and improvements in gross domestic product 
however  rising interest rates may also have the effect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business  particularly new and used vehicle sales  because many of our customers finance their vehicle purchases 
as a result  rising interest rates may have the effect of simultaneously increasing our costs and reducing our revenues 
given our debt composition as of december   each one percent increase in market interest rates would increase our total annual interest expense  including floor plan interest  by million 
we receive interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers  which is reflected as a reduction in the cost of inventory on the balance sheet 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future floor plan credits  it is our expectation  based on historical experience  that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers 
governmental regulations and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
we are subject to a wide range of federal  state and local laws and regulations  such as local licensing requirements  consumer protection and privacy laws  wage and hour  anti discrimination and other employment practices laws  and environmental requirements governing  among other things  discharges into the air and water  aboveground and underground storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  handling and disposal of wastes and remediation of contamination arising from spills and releases 
if we or our employees at the individual dealerships violate these laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties  or a cease and desist order may be issued against our operations that are not in compliance 
our future acquisitions may also be subject to governmental regulation  including antitrust reviews 
future laws and regulations relating to our business may be more stringent than current laws and regulations and require us to incur significant additional costs 
our business and financial results may be adversely affected by claims alleging violations of laws and regulations related to our advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities 
our business is highly regulated 
in the past several years  private plaintiffs and state attorneys general have increased their scrutiny of advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles 
the conduct of our business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding unfair  deceptive and or fraudulent trade practices including advertising  marketing  sales  insurance  repair and promotion practices  truth in lending  consumer leasing  fair credit practices  equal credit opportunity  privacy  insurance  motor vehicle finance  installment finance  closed end credit  usury and other installment sales 
vehicle lessors could be subject to claims of negligent leasing in connection with their lessees vehicle operation 
we could be susceptible to such claims or related actions if we fail to operate our business in accordance with practices designed to avert such liability 
claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or any of our dealers by individuals  either individually or through class actions  or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings 
such actions may expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses and franchises to conduct dealership operations 
the loss of key personnel may adversely affect our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team  particularly our senior management and service and sales personnel 
manufacturer dealer agreements may require the prior approval of the applicable manufacturer before any change is made in dealership general managers 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees may materially impair the efficiency and productivity of our operations 
in addition  we may need to hire additional managers as we expand 
potential acquisitions are viable to us only if we are able to retain experienced managers or obtain replacement managers should the owner manger retire 
the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate  particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel  is highly competitive and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 
the loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers may adversely affect the ability of our dealerships to conduct their operations in accordance with the standards set by our headquarters management 
we depend on our executive officers as well as other key personnel 
not all our key personnel are bound by employment agreements  and those with employment agreements are bound only for a limited period of time 
further  we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key personnel 
if we are unable to retain our key personnel  we may be unable to successfully develop and implement our business plans 
our principal stockholders have substantial influence over us 
our principal stockholders  ripplewood llc and freeman spogli  beneficially own over of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  these entities have entered into a stockholders agreement with several of our other stockholders pursuant to which the other stockholders are required to vote their stock with ripplewood and freemen spogli 
in addition  ripplewood and freeman spogli both have representatives that are members of our board of directors 
as a result  these principal stockholders have the ability to control us and direct our affairs and business 
future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  any changes requiring that we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for employee stock options using the fair value method or changes in existing taxation rules related to stock options could have a significant negative effect on our reported results 
the financial accounting standards board has announced a change to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states that will require us to record charges to earnings for employee stock option grants 
this requirement will negatively impact our earnings in the future 
for example  recording a charge for employee stock options under statement of financial accounting standards no

with respect to certain of these claims  the sellers of dealerships we have acquired have indemnified us 
we do not expect that any potential liability from these claims will materially affect our financial condition  liquidity  results of operations or financial statement disclosures

we also operate collision repair centers that serve our markets 
our revenues are derived primarily from four offerings i the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new retail and the sale of new vehicles to commercial customers fleet the terms new retail and fleet being collectively referred to as new  ii the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being collectively referred to as used  iii maintenance and collision repair services and the sale of automotive parts collectively referred to as  fixed operations  and iv the arrangement of vehicle financing and the sale of various insurance and warranty products collectively referred to as  f i 
we evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle retailed pvr  our fixed operations based on aggregate gross profit  and f i based on gross profit pvr 
we assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit by comparing the year to year results of stores that we have operated for at least twelve months 
we have grown our business through the acquisition of platforms and numerous tuck in acquisitions 
tuck in acquisitions refer to the purchase of dealerships in the market areas in which we have existing dealerships 
we use tuck in acquisitions to increase the number of vehicle brands we offer in a particular market area and to create a larger gross profit base over which to spread overhead costs 
during the first quarter of  the reorganization of our platforms became effective 
our dealerships are now organized into principally four regions i florida comprising our coggin dealerships operating primarily in jacksonville and orlando and our courtesy dealerships operating in tampa  ii west comprising our mcdavid dealerships operating throughout texas  our thomason dealerships operating in portland  oregon  our spirit dealerships operating primarily in los angeles  california and our northern california dealerships  iii mid atlantic comprising our crown dealerships operating in north carolina  south carolina and southern virginia and iv south comprising our nalley dealerships operating in atlanta  georgia  and our north point dealerships operating in little rock  arkansas 
our plaza dealerships in st 
louis  missouri and our gray daniels dealerships operating in jackson  mississippi remain standalone operations 
within this more streamlined structure  we will evaluate our operations and financial results by dealership  rather than by platform 
the general managers  with direction from the regional ceos  will continue to have the independence and flexibility to respond effectively to local market conditions 
we expect a significant increase in management effectiveness as a result of this reorganization  as well as added operating and cost efficiencies 
however  we expect to incur severance and other related costs  which should be offset in the future by anticipated expense efficiencies to our ongoing cost structure 
our gross profit percentage varies with our revenue mix 
the sale of vehicles generally results in lower gross profit percentages than our fixed operations 
as a result  when fixed operations increase as a percentage of total sales  we expect our overall gross profit percentage to increase 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive based compensation  advertising  rent  insurance  utilities and other customary operating expenses 
a significant portion of our selling expenses is variable such as sales commissions  or controllable expenses such as advertising  generally allowing our cost structure to adapt in response to trends in our business 
we evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross profit and all other sg a expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit 
sales of vehicles particularly new vehicles have historically fluctuated with general macroeconomic conditions  including consumer confidence  availability of consumer credit and fuel prices 
although these factors may impact our business  we believe that any future negative trends will be mitigated by increased used vehicle sales and stability in our fixed operations  our variable cost structure  our regional diversity and our advantageous brand mix 
historically  our brand mix  which is weighted towards luxury and mid line import brands  has been less affected by market volatility than the us automobile industry as a whole 
we expect the recent industry wide gain in market share of the luxury and mid line import brands to continue in the near future 
our operations are generally subject to modest seasonal variations as we tend to generate more revenue and operating income in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
generally  the seasonal variations in our operations are caused by factors relating to weather conditions  changes in manufacturer incentive programs  model changeovers and consumer buying patterns  among other things 
over the past several years  certain automobile manufacturers have used a combination of vehicle pricing and financing incentive programs to generate increased customer demand for new vehicles 
these programs have served to increase competition with late model used vehicles 
we anticipate that the manufacturers will continue to use these incentive programs in the future and  as a result  we will continue to monitor and adjust our used vehicle inventory mix in response to these programs 
in addition  we will continue to expand our service capacity in order to meet anticipated future demand  as the relatively high volume of new vehicle sales  resulting from the highly incentivized new vehicle market  will drive future service demand at our dealership locations 
interest rates over the past several years have been at historical lows 
we do not believe that changes in interest rates significantly impact customer overall buying patterns  as changes in interest rates do not dramatically increase the monthly payment of a financed vehicle 
for example  the monthly payment for a typical vehicle financing transaction in which a customer finances  at over months increases by approximately with each basis point increase in interest rates 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  net income increased million  or per diluted share  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   from million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  income from continuing operations increased million  or per diluted share  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   from million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the increase in net income and income from continuing operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   resulted from several factors  including i charges during of million related to a goodwill impairment at our oregon platform and million of costs associated with the termination of our agreement to acquire the bob baker dealerships  ii the incremental results of franchises acquired during and iii continued strong performance of our f i and fixed operations businesses 
these factors were partially offset by i incremental advertising costs incurred in an effort to maintain new vehicle sales volumes and ii start up costs associated with new dealership locations and our entrance into the southern california market

same store used vehicle retail revenue increased  on relatively flat same store unit sales  to billion for the year ended december   as manufacturer incentive programs on new vehicles continue to impact our used vehicle retail unit sales volume and sales revenue per used vehicle retailed 
we anticipate that manufacturer incentives on new vehicles will continue to drive customers toward new vehicles during fixed operations revenue increased  on a same store basis  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in our customer pay and warranty parts and service businesses  collectively up approximately on a same store basis 
the growth in our customer pay business is a result of increased capacity utilization  equipment upgrades  continued focus on customer retention initiatives and the implementation of more aggressive advertising campaigns 
our warranty business continued its positive performance driven by continued manufacturer recall programs and increased work on imported vehicles  which typically generate higher revenue than domestic brands 
these improvements were offset by a reduction in our collision repair center business  which decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in our collision repair center business is primarily attributable to our dealerships located in texas  where a major hailstorm in resulted in incremental collision repair revenues in total f i revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  platform f i revenue increased or million on a same store basis to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase is attributable to i increased service contract penetration  ii utilization of menus in the f i sales process iii maturation of our corporate sponsored programs and iv improvement of the f i operations at franchises we acquired in prior periods  as f i revenues have historically continued to improve for several years after we acquire a dealership 
platform f i excludes revenue resulting from a contract negotiated by our corporate office in july of  which is attributable to retail units sold during prior periods 
corporate f i revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of million was a result of the full year impact in of the contract negotiated by our corporate office compared to a six month impact in we expect this revenue to decrease significantly over the next few years and ultimately to zero by we expect total revenue to increase as we continue to acquire dealerships and expand our service capacity in order to meet anticipated future demand 
in addition  we expect that the relatively high volume of new vehicle sales over the past several years  which resulted from the highly incentivized new vehicle market  will drive future service demand

gross profit increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  same store gross profit increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  same store gross profit on new and used retail vehicle sales increased to million and to million  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  general market conditions  particularly in the second and third quarters of  forced us to reduce our new vehicle gross profit pvr in order to maintain unit sales volumes 
the used vehicle market continued to be affected by the use of new vehicle incentives by manufacturers  encouraging many customers who otherwise would have purchased used vehicles to purchase new vehicles instead 
same store gross profit from fixed operations increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   resulting primarily from increased gross profit from our customer pay and warranty parts and service businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   sg a expenses increased million to million  from million for the year ended december  sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profit for the year ended december  increased to  from for the year ended december  sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profit increased in as a result of i start up operations of a new dealership in texas and our entrance into the southern california market  the combined operations of which incurred million of sg a while contributing only million of gross profit ii million of increased rent resulting from a sale leaseback transaction completed during  iii million of increased advertising expense  primarily in the second and third quarters  in an effort to maintain retail unit volumes  and iv million of incremental costs associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance 
we estimate that the annualized rent from the completion of a sale leaseback transaction in which we sold land and buildings with a net book value of million to an unaffiliated third party for net proceeds of million will be approximately million  net of amortization of the million deferred gain 
we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment in the third quarter of we are currently evaluating the effect of this statement on our financial statements and related disclosures  however  had we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
in our sg a expense would have increased by million 
in connection with the reorganization of our platforms into four regions  we expect to incur approximately million of severance and other related costs including the settlement of multi year contracts  which should be partially offset in by anticipated expense efficiencies to our ongoing cost structure 
we estimate that these efficiencies will reduce sg a expense annually by million to million  beginning in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to the addition of property and equipment acquired during and  offset by a reduction in property and equipment sold in a sale leaseback transaction completed in we expect depreciation and amortization to increase in the future as a result of previous and future capital expenditure projects to remodel and upgrade our facilities 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess goodwill and other intangibles for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we determined that  based on how our business was organized and managed at that time  each of our platforms qualified as a reporting unit for the purpose of assessing goodwill for impairment 
impairment of goodwill occurs if the net book value of a platform exceeds its estimated fair value 
on october   in connection with our annual impairment test  we determined that the fair value of our oregon platform declined below its carrying value due to i the delay in its expected recovery following changes of top level management  ii the reduction in retail used vehicle sales volumes due to manufacturer rebates and incentives on new vehicles  iii the delay in the timing of the anticipated recovery of the oregon economy  and iv the decline in its market share 
we engaged a third party valuation firm to determine the fair value of the oregon platform  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million 
as a result of this charge  our oregon platform s goodwill was reduced from million to million 
as a result of the implementation of productivity and expense reduction initiatives  changes at the top level of management and improvements in the local economy  we experienced improvement in the financial and operating results of our dealerships in oregon during the year ended december   and expect continued improvements in we anticipate that changes in our management  operational and reporting structure associated with the reorganization of our platforms into four regions  which became effective in january  and additional changes to be made in will ultimately lead us to the determination that goodwill will be evaluated at the operating segment level in the future 
other income expense floor plan interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of an increasing interest rate environment and higher average inventory levels during as compared to  resulting primarily from the additional inventory of acquired franchises 
these factors were offset by our decision to repay a portion of our floor plan notes payable in the fourth quarter of the decrease in other interest expense of approximately million from the prior year to million was principally attributable to the repayment of million of mortgage debt with the proceeds from a sale leaseback transaction and the effect of capitalized interest on a higher level of construction in progress during  compared to these factors were offset by a higher average debt balance during  compared to income tax provision income tax expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was compared to for the same period in excluding the million goodwill impairment charge associated with our oregon platform and the related million tax benefit  our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  as we operate nationally  our effective tax rate is dependent upon our geographic revenue mix 
we evaluate our effective tax rate periodically based on our revenue sources 
we will continue to evaluate our effective tax rate in the future  and expect that our future annual effective tax rate will fluctuate between and 
discontinued operations during the year ended december   we sold ten dealership locations fourteen franchises  and as of december   we were actively pursuing the sale of two dealership locations four franchises and real estate associated with two former dealership locations 
the million loss from discontinued operations is attributable to the loss on the sale of dealerships during the year ended december   and the operating losses of the franchises mentioned above 
the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december   of million includes the net operating losses of the dealerships mentioned above and the net operating losses and net loss on the sale of i four dealership locations six franchises  ii eleven used only dealership locations and iii two ancillary businesses  which were sold during we continuously evaluate the financial and operating results of our dealerships  specifically the contributing the least amount of operating income  and we will look to divest dealerships that do not meet our expectations

income before income taxes totaled million for the year ended december   down from million for the year ended december  the decrease in income before income taxes for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was primarily caused by the following items i a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to our oregon platform see further discussion below under impairment of goodwill  ii a charge of million related to the termination of our agreement to acquire the bob baker dealerships and iii million of costs in connection with management changes at our oregon and texas platforms and at the corporate level

application of critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require management to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the specific identification method to value our vehicle inventories and the first in  first out method fifo to account for our parts inventories 
we maintain a reserve for specific inventory units where cost basis exceeds fair value 
in assessing lower of cost or market for new vehicles  we primarily consider the aging of vehicles and loss histories  along with the timing of annual and model changeovers 
the assessment of lower of cost or market for used vehicles considers recent data and trends such as loss histories  current aging of the inventory and current market conditions 
these reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
notes receivable finance contracts as of december  and  we had outstanding notes receivable from finance contracts of million and million  respectively net of an allowance for credit losses of million and million  respectively 
these notes have initial terms ranging from to months  and are collateralized by the related vehicles 
the assessment of our allowance for credit losses considers historical loss ratios and the performance of the current portfolio with respect to past due accounts 
we continually analyze our current portfolio against our historical performance 
in addition  we attribute minimal value to the underlying collateral in our assessment of the reserve 
f i chargeback reserve we receive commissions from the sale of vehicle service contracts  credit life insurance and disability insurance to customers 
in addition  we receive commissions from financing institutions for arranging customer financing 
we may be charged back chargebacks for finance  insurance or vehicle service contract commissions in the event a contract is terminated 
the revenues from financing fees and commissions are recorded at the time the vehicles are sold and a reserve for future chargebacks is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
this data is evaluated on a product by product basis 
these reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
equity based compensation we account for stock based compensation issued to employees in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
apb opinion no 
requires the use of the intrinsic value method  which measures compensation cost as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
see also recent accounting pronouncements below for a discussion of the impact on our financial statements from the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets  that are deemed to have indefinite lives 
we test these assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if any event occurs or circumstances change that indicate possible impairment 
we have determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life as there are no legal  contractual  economic or other factors that limit their useful lives and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers brand names 
goodwill and manufacturer franchise rights are allocated to each reporting unit at the platform and dealership level  respectively 
the fair market value of our manufacturer franchise rights is determined at the acquisition date through discounting the projected cash flows attributable to each franchise 
goodwill represents the excess cost of the businesses acquired over the fair market value of the identifiable net assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we determined that each of our platforms qualified as a reporting unit as we operate in one segment  and our platforms are one level below our corporate level  discrete financial information existed for each platform and the management of each platform directly reviewed the platform s performance 
in late  we began the process of reorganizing our platforms into four regions 
within this more streamlined structure  we will evaluate our operations and financial results by dealership  rather than by platform 
the general managers  with direction from the regional ceos  will continue to have the independence and flexibility to respond effectively to local market conditions 
we anticipate that changes in our management  operational and reporting structure  which became effective in january  and additional changes to be made in will ultimately lead us to the determination that goodwill will be evaluated at the operating segment level in the future 
we review goodwill and indefinite lived manufacturer franchise rights for impairment annually on october st of each year  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the related fair market value of our underlying businesses 
all other intangible assets are deemed to have definite lives and are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the asset ranging from to years and are tested for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired 
accrued expenses payments owed to our various service providers are expensed during the month in which the applicable service is performed 
the amount of these expenses is dependent upon information provided by our internal systems and processes 
due to the length of time necessary to receive accurate information  estimates of amounts due are necessary in order to record monthly expenses 
in subsequent months  expenses are reconciled and adjusted where necessary 
we continue to refine the estimation process based on an increased understanding of the time requirements and close working relationships with our service providers 
related party transactions certain of our directors  shareholders and their affiliates  and regional management have engaged in transactions with us 
these transactions primarily relate to long term operating leases of our dealership facilities 
we believe that these transactions and our other related party transactions involve terms comparable to what would be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
for the years ended december   and  million  million and million  respectively  of lease payments were made to entities controlled by our directors  shareholders or employees 
for the years ended december   and  million  million and million  respectively  was paid to an advertising entity in which one of our former directors had a substantial interest 
during each of the years ended december  and  we paid million in legal fees to a law firm in which one of our directors is of counsel 
in  we sold one dealership facility three franchises to a member of our board of directors for million 
after the allocation of million of goodwill  the book value approximated the selling price of the franchises sold 
in  in two separate transactions  we leased two vehicles to two members of our board of directors for a total of million 
in  we purchased land for million  sold it to one of our directors for million and entered into a long term operating lease with the director for the property 
the land is contiguous to other property owned by this director  for which we currently have long term operating leases 
in  we acquired one dealership facility five franchises with annualized revenue of approximately million from an executive of one of our platforms for million 
in  we acquired land from one of our former directors for million for the purpose of expanding the operations of one of our dealership s facilities and for the construction of a new body shop facility

reconciliation of non gaap financial information platform f i gross profit pvr we evaluate our f i gross profit performance on a pvr basis by dividing our total f i gross profit by the number of retail vehicles sold during the period 
during  we renegotiated a contract with one of our third party f i product providers  which resulted in the recognition of income that was not attributable to retail vehicles sold during the year 
we believe that platform f i  which excludes the additional revenue derived from contracts negotiated by our corporate office  provides a more accurate measure of our f i operating performance 
the following table reconciles f i gross profit to platform f i gross profit  and provides the necessary components to calculate platform f i gross profit pvr in thousands  except for unit and per vehicle data for the years ended december  f i gross profit  net as reported less corporate f i gross profit platform f i gross profit platform f i gross profit pvr retail units sold new retail units used retail units total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
based on million of variable rate long term debt including the current portion outstanding as of december   a change in interest rates would result in a change of approximately million to our annual other interest expense 
conversely  based on fixed rate debt of million a change in interest would mean we would not experience the impact of a million change in interest expense 
based on floor plan amounts outstanding at december   a change in the interest rates would result in a million change to annual floor plan interest expense 
we received million of interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers during the year ended december  interest credit assistance reduced cost of sales for the year ended december  by million and reduced new vehicle inventory by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future floor plan credits  it is our expectation  based on historical data  that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers 
hedging risk we use interest rate swaps to manage our capital structure 
in december  we entered into two forward interest rate swaps with a combined notional principal amount of million  which will provide a hedge against changes in the interest rates of our variable rate floor plan notes payable for a period of eight years beginning in march during the second quarter of  we reduced the notional principal amount of these swap agreements to million 
this transaction resulted in a gain of million  which is included in other long term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction to interest expense over the swap period  beginning in march the swap agreements were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges of future changes in interest rates of our variable rate floor plan indebtedness and we expect that these hedges  which may contain minor ineffectiveness  will be highly effective during the swap period from march through february as of december   the swaps had a fair value of million  which was included in other long term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million as a hedge against changes in the fair value of our senior subordinated notes due under the terms of the swap agreement  we are required to make variable rate payments based on six month libor and receive a fixed rate of 
this swap agreement was designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge of our fixed rate senior subordinated debt and did not contain any ineffectiveness 
as of december   the swap agreement had a fair value of million  which was included in other long term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in december  we entered into a forward interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million as a hedge against future changes in the interest rate of one of our variable rate mortgage notes payable beginning in january under the terms of the swap agreement  we are required to make payments at a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate based on libor 
this swap agreement was designated in and we expect that it will qualify as an cash flow hedge of future changes in the interest rate of one of our variable rate mortgage notes payable and will not contain any ineffectiveness 
as of december   the swap agreement had a fair value of million  which was included in other long term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
