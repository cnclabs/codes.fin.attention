 accounting for advertising barter transactions 
barter transactions accounted for   and  of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
expenses that are not directly related to a specific event are recorded as incurred 
expenses that specifically relate to an event are deferred until the event is held  at which time they are expensed 
expenses to promote and operate our events are categorized as follows sanction fees and purses  which include payments made to sanctioning bodies for prize and point fund monies as well as fees to the sanctioning body  sales  marketing and promotion expenses  which include all costs to advertise and promote our events together with the overhead costs of the sales and marketing organization  and other operating expenses  which include all direct costs associated with running events  such as hospitality  equipment  supplies  security  traffic control and labor as well as all facility related costs such as real estate taxes  utilities and insurance 
the distribution of these expenses for the last three years was as follows sanction fees and purses sales  marketing and promotion other operating general and administrative depreciation and amortization total before impairment charges impairment charges total expenses operating and marketing expenses decreased by  primarily as a result of the company s decision to discontinue the st 
petersburg event  the grand prix of denver event and the irl event at its gateway international raceway facility in  which had combined expenses of  in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sanction fees and purse expenses at all of the company s nascar sanctioned events promoted in and an increase in expenses associated with the additional revenues from the company s grandstand rental business

petersburg and denver offices  in april the year ended december  also included  related to the settlement of a legal claim at gateway international raceway 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by  primarily due to the reduction in the company s depreciable asset base resulting from impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of to write down the assets used to promote and run the company s former grand prix of denver and grand prix of st 
petersburg events 
net interest expense decreased by  primarily as a result of the decrease in the outstanding borrowings on the company s credit facility in as compared to and the receipt in may of  of interest from the internal revenue service related to an income tax refund for prior years 
interest expense in included  for interest related to the judgment discussed above 
the company s effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is principally due to the rate being affected by the non deductibility of the impairment of goodwill and the fact that the company paid state income taxes to delaware because of the profitability at dover international speedway even though the consolidated entity reported a pre tax loss 
the and rates were affected by state income tax expense attributable to valuation allowances established on state net operating losses 
the company expects its effective income tax rate to be higher than the statutory rate for similar reasons 
the company reported net earnings of  in as compared to a net loss of  in the net loss in resulted primarily from the company recording an after tax  non cash charge of  related to the impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets and from operating losses associated with the promotion of the grand prix of st 
petersburg event  the grand prix of denver event and the irl event at gateway international raceway 
the net earnings in resulted primarily from the improvement in operations at fourteen of the sixteen major events promoted by the company  the company s decision to discontinue the st 
petersburg event  the denver event and the gateway irl event in  and the aforementioned decreases in depreciation and net interest expenses 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  for the year ended december   revenues declined by less than to  as compared to we reported a loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change of  in as compared to earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change of  in  as follows change loss earnings from continuing operations before income tax benefit provision and cumulative effect of accounting change income tax benefit provision loss earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change loss earnings per common share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change the change from to resulted primarily for two reasons non cash impairment charges  and lower results from our cart events 
the components of the change in loss earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change and loss earnings per common share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change are as follows net of income tax benefits change per common share change goodwill impairment charge long lived asset impairment charges change in operating results of cart events additional depreciation from cart investments amortization and write off of credit facility fees deferred income tax asset valuation allowance all other these fees arose primarily from amendments to the company s former bank facility that were required due to lower than expected earnings  principally from cart sanctioned events 
impairment in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
as a result of our november annual assessment  it was determined that goodwill associated with our acquisition of grand prix was impaired 
therefore  an impairment charge of  was recorded in the fourth quarter and full year results to adjust goodwill to its fair value 
after recording this charge  the amount of goodwill remaining is  which represents of total assets and of stockholders equity at december  the company s investment in cart sanctioned street venues relating to its grand prix events was  as of december  in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets other than goodwill are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to analyze recoverability for assets to be held and used  the company projects undiscounted net future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over the remaining life of such assets 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
as a result of this assessment  it was concluded that assets related to the st 
petersburg and denver events were impaired 
therefore  a non cash charge of  was recorded in the fourth quarter of to reflect the diminution in value of these assets 
the uncertainty concerning the future of cart and cart s bankruptcy filing on december  contributed substantially to the loss of value 
in addition  the company also recorded an impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of related to equipment that will no longer be used in the normal course of business and is being disposed of 
impact of cart for the year ended december   revenue was  compared with  in the following table displays revenue from cart sanctioned events and all other company events for the last two years change cart events all other events total revenues two of the three cart events in were held early in the year prior to the start of the iraqi war 
we believe that the uncertainty caused by this geopolitical turmoil  together with lower consumer spending and confidence from the effects of the slow economy and the much publicized worsening financial situation at cart  caused a decline in admissions revenue at the long beach event and lower than expected admissions at the inaugural st 
petersburg event 
the continuing uncertainty as to the ongoing viability of cart during also contributed to a significant decline in revenue at our denver event in august the impact of lower revenue at the two existing cart events together with the substantial operating loss at the inaugural st 
petersburg event decreased the operating profit of the company by  from the previous year 
further  the company s  increase in depreciation in was almost exclusively the result of its investments in cart sanctioned events 
the decline in operating results  plus additional depreciation related to our cart sanctioned events  represented  of the company s decrease in earnings in the company is not running events in st 
petersburg or denver in  which had revenue of  and  respectively  in refer to note impairment charges of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for further discussion 
all other operations the company s other events recorded a increase in revenues in  which resulted from higher broadcasting fees  partially offset by lower admissions and other revenue 
due to the significant lead time in the industry for sponsors commitments and fans desire to purchase tickets in advance  the sluggish economy in and early negatively affected our sponsorship and admissions revenue 
poor weather on or near the dates of one half of our major events in also impacted admissions  concessions and merchandise sales 
operating and marketing expenses increased by to  in  but actually increased by less than when excluding  of costs associated with the st 
petersburg event which will not occur in sanction fees and purses increased by  in over and was the company s largest cost increase in absolute and relative terms 
nascar s current tv broadcast rights contracts have been reported to contain approximately annual increases in revenue through a portion of the purses related to the events broadcast under this contract also contain similar percentage increases and represented million of the company s year over year change in sanction fees and purses 
sales  marketing and promotion expenses increased by  primarily due to the inaugural st 
petersburg event 
other operating expenses increased by  due to the st 
petersburg event  offset by savings at other major events 
other operating expenses at the st 
petersburg event were  lower labor  hospitality  taxes and other operating expenses at several other major events produced approximately  of savings compared with the prior year 
general and administrative expenses in were lower than in the previous year  principally due to lower wages  utilities  legal claims and other expenses 
wages reflected fewer people than a year earlier and lower commissions 
also  there were no management incentive compensation payments in a decrease in utilities cost reflected internal efficiencies and tighter scrutiny of demand and usage 
legal claims in were generally at a normal level considering the risks and business issues of the company  whereas the prior year s legal costs were above historical levels 
legal costs were approximately  lower in than in offsetting administrative savings in were two areas of expense increases 
a full year of overhead costs at denver and st 
petersburg increased administrative expenses by  and fringe benefits  particularly from our medical program  also increased administrative expenses by  in depreciation and amortization expense increased by  primarily due to an increase in depreciation related to assets acquired for the inaugural grand prix of denver event that occurred in september and the grand prix of st 
petersburg event that occurred in february net interest expense increased by  in due to higher amortization and write off of credit facility fees of  partially offset by less interest expense due to lower outstanding balances under the company s bank credit facility 
although overall short term interest rates declined during the year  the company s effective cost did not decrease at the same rate  as pricing under the former bank facility was increased during the year as a result of amendments to the facility 
interest expense related to the swida bonds was essentially the same in and at  and  respectively 
these bonds contain a fixed rate of interest and the amount outstanding decreased by during the year 
the effective income tax rate was in compared with in the rate was affected principally by the non deductibility of the impairment of goodwill and also by the establishment of a valuation allowance recorded against certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
the rate was also affected by other permanent book vs 
tax differences and the fact that the company paid income taxes to the state of delaware 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  in the increase relates primarily to the company reporting earnings before income taxes and impairment charges of  in as compared to a loss of  in and the increase in income tax refunds received 
offsetting these increases was the impact of the timing of invoicing to and receipts from customers and the timing of payments to vendors 
net cash used in investing activities was  in as compared to  in capital expenditures were  in  up from the  in the only major project under construction during was the installation of safer barriers at the company s dover international speedway  nashville superspeedway  gateway international raceway and memphis motorsports park facilities 
net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  net cash used in primarily related to repayments of borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement and long term debt 
the company paid cash dividends of  in as compared to  in effective february   the company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries  as co borrowers  entered into a  revolving credit agreement with a bank group that expires february  provisions of the credit facility adjust the commitment to  on november   to  on november  and to  on november  the facility  which replaced the company s previous revolving credit facility  provides for seasonal funding needs  capital improvements  letter of credit requirements and other general corporate purposes 
interest is based  at the company s option  upon libor plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ratio the leverage ratio or the base rate the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio 
the terms of the credit facility  as amended effective february   contain certain covenants including minimum tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage and maximum funded debt to ebitda 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority perfected security interest and lien on all available assets owned by the company and its subsidiaries 
the credit facility also provides that a default by the company or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries under any other loan agreement would constitute a default under this credit facility 
at december   the company was in compliance with the terms of the facility 
material adverse changes in the company s results of operations could impact its ability to maintain financial ratios necessary to satisfy these requirements 
there was  outstanding under the facility at december   at a weighted average interest rate of 
after consideration of stand by letters of credit outstanding  borrowings of  were available pursuant to the facility at december  based on operating results to date and projected future results  the company is expected to be in compliance with all of the covenants for all measurement periods in cash provided by operating activities  less maintenance of a dividend  is expected to generate between  in excess cash in  which we expect to use to reduce indebtedness and for capital expenditures 
based on current business conditions  the company expects to make capital expenditures of approximately  during these expenditures primarily relate to the installation of safer barriers at the company s fixed facility tracks and the acquisition of additional land adjacent to dover international speedway to be used for parking facilities and other fan amenities 
during the first quarter of  the remaining parcels of property adjacent to our dover facility not already owned by the company became available for sale 
the company purchased these parcels for approximately  additionally  the company expects to contribute approximately  to its pension plans in we expect continued cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our credit agreement to also provide for long term liquidity 
on january   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on both classes of common stock of per share 
the dividend was paid on march  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  contractual obligations at december   the company had the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments total payments due by period thereafter notes payable to banks swida bonds total debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations we have a  revolving line of credit agreement 
at december    was outstanding under the facility 
after consideration of stand by letters of credit outstanding  borrowings of  were available pursuant to the facility at december  in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  series  to acquire  construct and develop certain public infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway  of which  was outstanding at december  principal payments range from  in september to  in and are payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
if the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  the company would become responsible for the difference 
in the event the company was unable to make the payments  they would be made pursuant to a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by the existing bank group 
the company believes that the sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility will continue to satisfy the necessary debt service requirements of the bonds 
as of december  and   and  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by the sports authority to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during the year ended december    was paid by the company into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for principal and interest payments 
if the debt service is not satisfied from the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility  the bonds would become a liability of the company 
if we fail to maintain the letter of credit that secures the bonds or we allow an uncured event of default to exist under our reimbursement agreement relative to the letter of credit  the bonds would be immediately redeemable 
in  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  grand prix  entered into an agreement the swida loan with swida to receive the proceeds from the taxable sports facility revenue bonds  series gateway international motorsports corporation project  a municipal bond offering  in the aggregate principal amount of  of which  was outstanding at december  swida loaned all of the proceeds from the municipal bond offering to grand prix for the purpose of the redevelopment  construction and expansion of gateway  and the proceeds of the swida loan were irrevocably committed to complete construction of gateway  to fund interest  to create a debt service reserve fund and to pay for the cost of issuance of the bonds 
the repayment terms and debt service reserve requirements of the bonds issued in the municipal bond offering correspond to the terms of the swida loan 
the company has established certain restricted cash funds to meet debt service as required by the swida loan  which are held by the trustee bny trust company of missouri 
at december    of the company s cash balance was restricted by the swida loan and is appropriately classified as a non current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the swida loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on all the real property owned and a security interest in all property leased by gateway 
also  the swida loan is unconditionally guaranteed by grand prix 
the swida loan bears interest at varying rates ranging from to with an effective rate of approximately 
interest expense related to the swida loan was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the structure of the bonds permits amortization from february through february with debt service beginning in a stand by letter of credit for  which is secured by a trust deed on the company s facilities in memphis  tennessee  also was obtained to satisfy debt service reserve fund obligations

critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those the company considers critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
goodwill the company has made acquisitions in the past that included goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is typically less than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
the company completed its annual assessment of goodwill in november and determined that there was no impairment loss related to its goodwill as of that date 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the assessment of goodwill 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result that could require the company to record an impairment charge related to its goodwill 
at december   the remaining balance of goodwill was  since the majority of our goodwill is associated with grand prix  which promotes a ccws sanctioned event  any material adverse events impacting ccws could cause additional impairment losses to be recorded in the future 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
currently  the company maintains a valuation allowance  which increased by  in  on deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carry forwards 
the company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or a portion of these deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
accrued pension cost the benefits provided by the company s defined benefit pension plans are based on years of service and employee s remuneration over their employment with the company 
the company establishes accrued pension costs in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
accrued pension costs are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including estimates for the discount rate  assumed rate of compensation increase and expected long term rate of return on assets 
changes in these estimates would impact the amounts that the company records in its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable reserves the company provides for losses on accounts receivable based upon their current status  historical experience and management s evaluation of existing economic conditions 
significant changes in customer financial condition or general economic conditions may have a significant effect on the company s allowance for doubtful accounts 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and up to years for facilities 
these estimates require assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment when an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist

factors that may affect operating results  forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  relating to our financial condition  profitability  liquidity  resources  business outlook  proposed acquisitions  market forces  corporate strategies  consumer preferences  contractual commitments  legal matters  capital requirements and other matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ substantially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements 
when words and expressions such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  plans  intends  objectives  goals  aims  projects  forecasts  possible  seeks  may  could  should  might  likely  enable or similar words or expressions are used in this document  as well as statements containing phrases such as in our view  there can be no assurance  although no assurance can be given or there is no way to anticipate with certainty  forward looking statements are being made 
various risks and uncertainties may affect the operation  performance  development and results of our business and could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in our forward looking statements  including the following factors stability and viability of sanctioning bodies  success of or changes in our growth strategies  development and potential acquisition of new facilities  anticipated trends in the motorsports industry  patron demographics  obtaining favorable contracts relative to sponsorships  event sanctions and broadcast rights  relationships with sanctioning bodies  sponsors  broadcast media  drivers and teams  general market and economic conditions  including consumer and corporate spending sentiment  ability to finance future business requirements  the availability of adequate levels of insurance  ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and businesses  management retention and development  changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations  including environmental regulations  the effect of weather conditions on outdoor event attendance  military or other government actions  availability of air travel  and national or local catastrophic events 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements as a result of future developments  events or conditions 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  stockholders should not overly rely or attach undue weight to our forward looking statements as an indication of our actual future results 
our relationships with and the success of various sanctioning bodies is vital to our success in motorsports our continued success in motorsports is dependent upon the success of various governing bodies of motorsports that sanction national racing events and our ability to secure favorable contracts with and maintain a good working relationship with these sanctioning bodies  including nascar  irl  nhra and ccws 
sanctioning bodies regularly issue and award sanctioned events and their issuance depends  in large part  on maintaining good working relationships with the sanctioning bodies 
many events are sanctioned on an annual basis with no obligation to renew  including our agreements with nascar 
by awarding a sanctioned event or a series of sanctioned events  the sanctioning bodies do not warrant  nor are they responsible for  the financial success of any sanctioned event 
our inability to obtain additional sanctioned events in the future and to maintain sanction agreements at current levels would likely result in lower than anticipated revenues from admissions  broadcast rights  sponsorships  hospitality  concessions and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from the broadcast revenues received through the arrangements that nascar has made with various broadcast media  many of which expire in the success of a particular sanctioning body in attracting drivers and teams  signing series sponsors and negotiating favorable television and or radio broadcast rights is largely outside of our control 
as our success depends on the success of each event or series that we are promoting  a material adverse effect on a sanctioning body  such as the loss or defection of top drivers  the loss of significant series sponsors  or the failure to obtain favorable broadcast coverage or to properly advertise the event or series could result in a reduction in our revenues from admissions  sponsorships  hospitality  concessions and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on sponsorship contracts to generate revenues we receive a substantial portion of our annual revenues from sponsorship agreements  including the sponsorship of our various events and our permanent venues  such as title  official product and promotional partner sponsorships  billboards  signage and skyboxes 
loss of our title sponsors or other major sponsorship agreements or failure to secure such sponsorship agreements in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our motorsports events face intense competition for attendance  television viewership and sponsorship we compete with other auto speedways for the patronage of motor racing spectators as well as for promotions and sponsorships 
moreover  racing events sanctioned by different organizations are often held on the same dates at different tracks 
the quality of the competition  type of racing event  caliber of the event  sight lines  ticket pricing  location and customer conveniences  among other things  distinguish the motorsports facilities 
in addition  all of our events compete with other sports and recreational events scheduled on the same dates 
as a result  our revenues and operations are affected not only by our ability to compete in the motorsports promotion market  but also by the availability of alternative spectator sports events  forms of entertainment and changing consumer preferences 
our long beach event depends on city permits and good relationships with city officials in order to conduct the grand prix of long beach  we must obtain an annual permit from the city of long beach to hold the race on city streets 
although grand prix has operated a racing event on the streets of long beach for thirty years  there can be no assurance that this event will continue to be held or be successful 
our ability to conduct the grand prix of long beach requires that we maintain excellent relationships with the host city and its officials 
grand prix s ability to meet payment obligations under a loan agreement with an illinois government agency depends on revenues from gateway in order to finance the redevelopment of gateway international raceway  grand prix entered into a loan agreement with swida  which agreed to fund a loan to grand prix by issuing municipal bonds in the aggregate principal amount of  the bonds are unconditionally guaranteed by grand prix 
grand prix issued a year  promissory note to swida which bears interest at an effective rate of approximately per annum 
payments on the swida loan are intended to be made primarily from the revenues from the operations of gateway 
although grand prix is current on its obligation and expects to meet its future debt payment obligations out of the revenues from gateway  and although grand prix will receive certain assistance from the city of madison  illinois in the form of a tax increment finance fund which should assist it in meeting its debt burdens  there can be no assurance that earnings from the future operations of gateway will be sufficient to meet grand prix s debt service obligations 
a default under the swida loan could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the sales tax and property tax revenues to service the revenue bonds for infrastructure improvements at nashville may be inadequate in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in revenue bonds to build local infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway  of which  was outstanding on december  debt service on the bonds is payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
as of december  and   and  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by the sports authority to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during the year ended december    was paid by the company into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for principal and interest payments 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the event the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient to cover the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  the company would become responsible for the difference 
in the event the company was unable to make the payments  they would be made under a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by the existing bank group pursuant to a reimbursement and security agreement under which we have agreed to reimburse the banks for drawings made under the letter of credit 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the seasonality of our motorsports events increases the variability of quarterly earnings our business has been  and is expected to remain  seasonal given that it depends on our outdoor events for a substantial portion of revenues 
we derive a substantial portion of our motorsports revenues from admissions and event related revenue attributable to six nascar sanctioned events at dover  delaware which are currently held in june and september 
this has been offset to some degree by our other motorsports events  but quarterly earnings will vary 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover catastrophic incidents we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient  in the opinion of management  to protect us from material financial loss incurred in the ordinary course of business 
we also purchase special event insurance for motorsports events to protect against race related liability 
however  there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 
if we are held liable for damages beyond the scope of our insurance coverage  including punitive damages  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
bad weather can have an adverse financial impact on our motorsports events we sponsor and promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things at these events 
although we sell many tickets well in advance of the outdoor events and these tickets are issued on a non refundable basis  poor weather conditions may adversely affect additional ticket sales and concessions and souvenir sales  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently maintain weather related insurance for major events 
due to the importance of clear visibility and safe driving conditions to motorsports racing events  outdoor racing events may be significantly affected by weather patterns and seasonal weather changes 
any unanticipated weather changes could impact our ability to stage events 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
