the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation  licensure  and operating compliance procedures 
national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress 
additionally  government and private insurance programs fund a significant portion of medical care costs in the united states 
in recent years  federal and state imposed limits on reimbursement to hospitals  long term care and assisted living facilities  home healthcare and other healthcare providers have affected spending budgets in certain markets within the medical products industry 
the nursing home and home healthcare industries have been impacted by these changes  and shifts in operations and business strategies  facility divestitures of elder care providers as well as overall general economic conditions over the last few years 
however  management believes that the additional funding under the medicare and medicaid programs during through  or add on reimbursement payments for providers of skilled nursing and long term care services  have positively impacted the financial strength of companies providing these services 
the add on reimbursement payments were scheduled to expire in september  concurrently with the expected refinement of the resource utilization groups rugs during october the rugs  which commenced as part of the balanced budget act of and were further refined under the balanced budget refinement act of  are used by cms to classify skilled nursing facility residents into medicare payment groups

the net effect of these changes in reimbursement as recommended by cms  and if approved by congress  is estimated to be essentially neutral or possibly no change in the effective reimbursement rates for fiscal year beginning october  
the final acceptance of cms recommendations is due in august management cannot yet determine the effects  if any  these changes may have on the financial strength of its customers and or the elder care services industry 
however  management believes the recent changes to the medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates along with the introduction of the medicare medicaid prescription drug program that became effective october has positively impacted  and will continue to positively impact  the financial condition of elder care providers and the financial strength of the elder care industry 
the federal budget presented for approval to congress includes a cut in funding for medicaid by billion over five years  commencing in congress also established a medicaid commission to recommend changes to modernize the medicaid program to ensure the cut in funding will be achieved over fiscal years through president bush stated in his state of the union address  which has subsequently been supported in speeches by members of congress  that the majority of the billion in savings is expected to come from prescription drug pricing  with indications that the primary source would be realized under the medicare medicaid prescription drug program

c if the physician business or the elder care business were to terminate a contract with a private label vendor for any reason  the company may be required to purchase the remaining inventory of private label products from the vendor  provided that  in no event would the company be required to purchase quantities of such products which exceed the aggregate amount of such products ordered by the company in the ninety day period immediately preceding the date of termination 
as of april   the company has not terminated any contracts with a private label vendor that had a material impact to the company s results of operations and financial condition 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management and the audit committee believe are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate the company s financial position and results of operations include the following 
the discussion below applies to each of the company s reportable segments physician business  elder care business  and corporate shared services  unless otherwise noted 
revenue recognition the physician business has two primary sources of revenue the sale of consumable products and the sale of equipment 
revenue from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped or delivered 
revenue for these products is recorded at shipment since at that time there is persuasive evidence that an 
table of contents arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and the collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of single deliverable equipment is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped  unless there are multiple deliverables  in which case revenue is recognized when all obligations to the customer are fulfilled 
obligations to the customer are typically satisfied when installation and training are complete 
customers have the right to return consumable products and equipment 
sales allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue for potential product returns and estimated billing errors 
management analyzes sales allowances quarterly using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume and business conditions  as well as specific identification of significant returns or billing errors 
the elder care business has four primary sources of revenue the sale of consumable products to skilled nursing home facilities  assisted living facilities  and home care providers  the sale of consumable products to medicare eligible customers  the sale of equipment  and fees earned for providing medicare part b billing services 
revenue from the sale of consumable products to skilled nursing home facilities  assisted living facilities  and home care providers is recognized when products are shipped or delivered 
revenue for these products is recorded at shipment since at that time there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and the collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of consumable products to medicare eligible customers is recognized upon estimated usage of the product 
revenue is recorded at the amounts expected to be collected from medicare  other third party payors  and directly from customers 
revenue for medicare reimbursement is recorded based on government determined reimbursement prices for medicare covered items 
medicare reimburses of the government determined reimbursement prices for reimbursable supplies and the remaining balance is billed to either third party payors or directly to customers 
reimbursement from medicare is subject to review by appropriate government regulators 
revenue from the sale of single deliverable equipment is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped  unless there are multiple deliverables  in which case revenue is recognized when all obligations to the customer are fulfilled 
revenue from providing medicare part b billing services on a fee for service or a full assignment basis to medicare eligible customers is recognized during the period the supplies being billed to medicare are delivered to patients 
customers have the right to return consumable products and equipment 
sales allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue for potential product and equipment returns  revenue adjustments related to actual usage of products by eligible medicare part b patients  medicare part b reimbursement denials  and billing errors 
management analyzes product returns and billing errors using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume and business conditions  as well as specific identification of significant returns or billing errors 
management analyzes revenue adjustments related to estimated usage of products by eligible medicare part b patients and medicare part b reimbursement denials using historical actual cash collection and actual adjustments to gross revenue for a certain period of time 
additional allowances are recorded for any significant specific adjustments known to management 
consolidated sales allowances are immaterial and generally represent less than of gross sales 
estimating allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect outstanding amounts due from its customers 
the allowances include specific amounts for those accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as bankruptcies  and general allowances for those accounts that management 
table of contents currently believes to be collectible but later become uncollectible 
estimates are used to determine the allowances for bad debts and are based on historical collection experience  current economic trends  credit worthiness of customers  changes in customer payment terms  and percentages applied to the accounts receivable aging categories 
the percentage of each aging category that is reserved is determined by analyzing historical write offs and current trends in the credit quality of the customer base 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations by reviewing the customer s current financial information 
a credit review is performed on new customers in the physician business and an annual credit review is performed on all major customers in the elder care business 
at a minimum  each elder care customer account is reviewed annually 
adjustments to credit limits and allowances for bad debts are made based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or improve  allowances may be adjusted which will impact general and administrative expenses and accounts receivable 
during fiscal year  the elder care business changed its method for establishing its allowance for doubtful accounts due to i changes in medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates and ii an analysis of the prior two years of accounts receivable collection and write off history and the then projected bad debt write offs 
based on the results of this analysis  combined with the changes to the reimbursement rates  management concluded that the methodology for establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts resulted in  and would continue to result in  an overstatement of the reserve requirement 
in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes apb  management revised the estimates used to establish the allowance for doubtful accounts for the elder care business 
this change in estimate reduced the reserve percentages applied to various aging categories of accounts receivable  to more closely reflect actual collection and write off history 
the impact of reducing the reserve percentages was approximately million  net of benefit for income taxes  or basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended april  no changes to the methodology have been made subsequent to december  inventory valuation inventories  which primarily consist of medical products and supplies and diagnostic equipment  are valued at the lower of cost or market  on a first in  first out basis 
as part of this valuation process  excess and slow moving inventories are reduced to estimated net realizable value 
the company s accounting for excess and slow moving inventory contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate when the inventory will be sold and the quantities and prices at which the inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
when preparing these estimates  management considers and reviews historical results  inventory quantities on hand  current operating trends  sales forecasts  and slow movement reports 
these estimates can be affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  supply interruption by a manufacturer  and other factors affecting demand for the company s inventory 
any adjustments to the valuation of inventory will impact cost of goods sold and inventory 
during fiscal year  the physician business recorded a million charge to cost of goods sold for a discontinued product line 
during fiscal year  candela corporation candela terminated a distribution agreement between the two companies and the company filed an arbitration proceeding with the american arbitration association against candela pss world medical  inc d b a physician sales service  claimant  v 
candela corporation  respondent for breach of contract  promissory estoppel  intentional interference with contractual advantageous relations  and violation of the massachusetts unfair business practices act 
candela filed counterclaims in the arbitration for breach of contract  seeking payment of million in outstanding invoices  which was recorded in accounts payable at the time of purchase  and alleged trademark infringement and violation of the massachusetts unfair business practices act 
the arbitrators ruled in favor of candela on may  due to the termination of the distribution agreement  including termination of manufacturer support  installation services  and warranty coverage  the physician business recorded an additional million charge to cost of goods sold during fiscal year estimating accruals for vendor rebates the company receives transaction based and performance based rebates from third party vendors 
such rebates are classified as either i a reduction to cost of goods sold  ii a reduction of the cost incurred  or iii an increase to net sales in the accompanying statements of operations 
transaction based rebates are generally associated with a 
table of contents specific customer contract and are recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time the transaction occurs 
performance based rebates are typically measured against inventory purchases from the manufacturer or sales volume levels and are received from the vendors at the time certain performance measures are achieved 
performance based rebates for contracts entered into subsequent to november  are recognized based on a systematic and rational allocation of the consideration to be received relative to the transaction that marks the progress of the company toward earning the rebate or refund  provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimatable 
therefore  management uses judgment and estimates to determine the amount of performance based rebates to recognize each period 
if the amounts are not probable and reasonably estimable  rebate income is recognized upon achieving the performance measure 
prior to november   rebate income was recognized in the period in which the performance measure was achieved 
vendor rebates are recognized in income only if the related inventory has been sold 
therefore  management estimates the amount of vendor rebate income related to inventory not sold and establishes a reserve on a quarterly basis 
if the facts and circumstances used by management to assess whether the performance targets will be achieved by the company or the amount of inventory that has been sold change  the company s financial condition and the results of operations could materially change period to period 
estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets the liability method is used for determining income taxes  under which current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  management considers and makes judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require management to adjust the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets generally depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
the company s tax filings are subjected to audit by the irs 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
management believes that these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of tax law 
resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty  accordingly  the company provides taxes only for the amounts management believes will ultimately result from these proceedings 
management does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to the tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  i the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by federal  state  and local tax authorities  ii the willingness of federal  state  and local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  and iii the impartiality of the federal  state  and local courts 
management s experience has been that the estimates and assumptions used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide  and the potential exists  however limited  that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
during fiscal year  the company sold its international business  which generated a capital loss carryforward 
at the time of sale  management believed it was more likely than not that the company would be unable to use the capital loss before its expiration in fiscal year and  accordingly  a valuation allowance was recorded 
based on recent tax court rulings  the company filed a refund claim with the irs during the three months ended december   to report an ordinary worthless stock deduction on the sale of the international business 
the refund claim reflected a reclassification of the nondeductible capital loss to a tax deductible ordinary loss 
the worthless stock deduction claim was combined with the formal protest to the results of the audit of the federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended march  and march  and was submitted to the appeals office of the irs 
during the three months ended december   the company and the appeals office of the irs reached a settlement 
this settlement  which is subject to final review and approval by the congressional joint committee on taxation joint committee  resulted in a one time reduction to the provision for income taxes for 
table of contents the fiscal year ended april  of approximately million 
management believes that the joint committee will uphold and approve the agreed upon settlement with the appeals office of the irs 
estimating useful lives of property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives 
useful life equipment to years computer hardware and software to years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives 
management is required to use judgment in determining the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model  changes in the company s business strategy  or changes in the planned use of property and equipment could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s current estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened or extended  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life 
during fiscal years   and  the company adjusted the useful lives of certain assets in accordance with apb  however  the impact to depreciation expense was immaterial 
during fiscal year  the estimated useful lives of certain computer hardware and software with a carrying value of approximately million will be extended months from march  to coincide with the expected service life of the assets 
computer hardware and software capitalized subsequent to this change in estimate will continue to be depreciated over a period ranging from to years 
this change in estimate is expected to result in a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million  net of tax  or approximately diluted earnings per share  for the fiscal year ended march  legal contingencies as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimatable  an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
professional fees related to these claims are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations 
management  with the assistance of outside counsel  determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and whether the amount of potential loss is estimatable 
the determination is based upon potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
management does not believe the outstanding legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in management s assumptions related to the anticipated or actual outcome of the outstanding legal proceedings 
during fiscal year  the company settled a lawsuit pursuant to which the company was required to pay approximately million to resolve all claims 
in addition  the company settled a lawsuit pursuant to which the opposing parties agreed to pay the company million to resolve all claims and counterclaims 
impairment of goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at each reporting unit annually on the last day of each fiscal year  which is the friday closest to march the physician business  the elder care business  
table of contents and corporate shared services are separate reporting units 
goodwill was not impaired during fiscal years and the impairment and disposal of long lived assets is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and iii significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
during fiscal year  the company made nonsolicitation payments to certain sales representatives that will be tested annually or more frequently for impairment in accordance with sfas certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment of the nonsolicitation agreements exists include  but are not limited to i a change in a state s legal system that would impact any legal opinion relied upon when assessing enforceability of the nonsolicitation covenants  ii a decline in sales generated by a sales representative below the amount that the nonsolicitation was based upon  iii death  or iv full retirement by the sales representative 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  revenues  earnings  and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
impairment charges would be included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
management does not believe there were any circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable during fiscal year business combinations the company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the company obtains valuations from an independent third party to assist in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing acquired intangible assets include  but are not limited to i expected future cash flows from existing customer contracts and relationships  ii assumptions relating to the impact of noncompete agreements on business operations  iii assumptions related to the impact on the timing of expected future cash flows  iv retention of customers and key business leaders  and v the risk inherent in investing in intangible assets 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption  estimates  or other actual results 

table of contents variable interest entity in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements fin  and in december  the fasb issued a revision of fin fin revised fin r 
fin r provides guidance with respect to the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
vies are characterized as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or there is not sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
reporting entities which have a variable interest in such an entity and are deemed to be the primary beneficiary must consolidate the variable interest entity 
at april   the company held a minority interest in tiger specialty sourcing limited and tiger shanghai specialty sourcing co 
ltd 
collectively tiger medical that is considered to be a vie as defined by fin r 
the company is considered to be the primary beneficiary as tiger medical provides sourcing services exclusively to the company 
therefore  the financial statements of tiger medical are consolidated with the company s financial statements 
the company acquired its interest in tiger medical for million and the realization of this investment is dependent on the product cost savings to the company 
the company is not obligated on any of the indebtedness of tiger medical nor is the company obligated to fund any operating losses of tiger medical 
therefore  the million acquisition price is the only amount at risk as of april  the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of april  included approximately million of cash and million of long term debt due to the principals of tiger medical 
pursuant to the terms of a sourcing services agreement  the company acquired its minority interest in tiger medical on january  for million 
the company ultimately has the right to increase its ownership interest in tiger medical to during fiscal years through if certain performance targets are achieved 
if at any time during the term of the sourcing services agreement  the company achieves the agreed upon cost of goods savings target in any twelve month period prior to achieving the agreed upon sales target  then either party has the right to trigger an early buy out of tiger medical by the company 
the total purchase price to be paid by the company for ownership of tiger medical ranges from million to million and depends on the satisfaction of certain performance targets 
cash payments made by the company during fiscal years through for additional interests in tiger medical will be credited against the final purchase price to be paid by the company 
accounting for discontinued operations on september   the company s board of directors adopted a plan to dispose of the imaging business  reflecting a strategic decision by management to focus the company s efforts on its physician and elder care businesses 
accordingly  the results of operations of the imaging business and the estimated loss on disposal were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas on november   the company completed the sale of di to imaging acquisition corporation the buyer  a wholly owned subsidiary of platinum equity  llc  a private equity firm platinum 
the sale was completed pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  dated as of october   among the company  the buyer  and platinum  as amended on november  the stock purchase agreement 
under the stock purchase agreement  the purchase price was million less i an adjustment for any change in net asset value from the initial net asset value target date and ii an adjustment for any change in the net cash from the initial net cash target date purchase price 
the estimated loss on disposal  which was subject to change based on the final purchase price adjustments  was finalized during fiscal year on march   the company received a letter from the buyer claiming a purchase price adjustment of million 
the claimed purchase price adjustment was based on an accounting of the net asset statement as of the closing date  which was delivered to the buyer in january pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement  the matter was referred to an independent accounting firm of national reputation for arbitration 
subsequent to march   the buyer provided an adjusted claim to the arbitrator claiming a purchase price adjustment of million 
during fiscal year  the arbitrator ruled in favor of the buyer for a purchase price adjustment of million 
as a result of the final ruling from the arbitrator  the company paid approximately million of settlement costs to the buyer during fiscal year during the settlement process  management 
table of contents estimated the net asset adjustment based on available information and revised its estimate on a quarterly basis  if needed

recent accounting pronouncements refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
risk factors the company s business is dependent on sophisticated data processing systems that may impact business operations if they fail to operate properly or not as anticipated 
the success of the company s business relies on the ability to obtain  process  analyze  maintain  and manage data 
in addition  data processing capabilities are continually upgraded 
the company has increasingly become more reliant on its information systems due to its consolidation and centralization of certain administrative functions 
management relies on this capability because third party ancillary billing services requires proper tracking and reporting  customer orders must be received and shipped on a timely basis  billings and collections for all customers must be managed efficiently and accurately  product cost information  net of rebates  is needed by the sales force in a timely manner to conduct business  product reporting  such as product sales by vendor and vendor incentives earned  is a requirement  centralized procurement and inventory management systems are required for effective inventory management  regulatory compliance on certain products requires proper tracking and reporting  rebates are received from manufacturers when certain products are sold and sophisticated systems to track  apply  and collect such rebates are needed  data and information systems must be converted after acquisitions are consummated and during operating system conversions  and proper employee compensation and record keeping is required 
the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if  among other things data processing capabilities are interrupted or fail for any extended length of time  data services are not kept current  the data processing system becomes unable to support expanded business  data is lost or unable to be re stored or processed  data security is breached  or product maintenance and upgrades to the erp system are no longer provided by oracle corporation 
the elder care business implementation of the jd edwards distribution and customer service modules may temporarily disrupt its operations 
the elder care business has successfully completed the implementation of the jde xe general ledger  accounts receivable  and accounts payable modules at all of its distribution centers 
during fiscal year  the elder care business successfully implemented the advanced warehouse distribution module of jde xe at of the distribution centers 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the elder care business successfully completed this implementation at the remaining distribution centers 
the elder care business will begin implementing the 
table of contents customer service module of jde xe during fiscal year management anticipates that this implementation will be successfully completed during the fiscal year there can be no assurance that the implementation of the jde xe customer service module at the elder care business distribution centers will be successfully completed without disrupting the results of operations of the business 
there also can be no assurance that the implementation will be completed within the time frame projected by management 
the company s net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly as a result of many factors  including fluctuating demand for the products and services offered by the company  the introduction of new products and services offered by the company and its competitors  seasonal vaccine sales  acquisitions  disposals  or investments by the company  changes in manufacturers pricing policies and or terms  changes in manufacturers distribution strategies  changes in the level of operating expenses  changes in estimates used by management  changes in business strategies by competitors  changes in business strategy by the company  product supply shortages  product recalls by manufacturers  inventory valuation adjustments  changes in product mix  general economic conditions  fuel costs and third party shipping rates  inclement weather  changes in accounting principles  disruptions resulting from implementing the strategic business plan  disruptions resulting from implementing the erp systems  the number of selling days in a period  and changes by the government in reimbursement rates 
accordingly  management believes that period to period comparisons of the results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that the results of operations may be below analysts and investors expectations in certain future periods 
this could materially and adversely affect the trading price of the company s common stock 
the company s future results could be adversely affected by operational disruptions due to natural disasters  particularly in regions susceptible to hurricanes 
a severe weather event such as a hurricane  tornado  or flood could cause severe damage to the company s property and inventory 
in addition  such weather events can cause extended disruptions to the company s operations 
during fiscal year  the coastal areas of florida were evacuated on at least four occasions due to hurricanes and the company s operations were disrupted for a period of several days 
the company can provide no assurance that a future hurricane or other local disaster would not materially impact the company s business or results of operations in the future 
the company has developed disaster recovery plans and maintains business interruption insurance for instances of catastrophic loss 
however  there is a risk that the company may fail to execute its disaster recovery plans or that losses may exceed policy limits 
in addition  the company may have difficulty obtaining business interruption insurance in the future or similar types of coverage may not be available in the markets in which it operates 
the company s disaster recovery plans include third party backup facilities for information system infrastructure  internal communication protocols to disseminate information and provide instruction to employees  and plans for 
table of contents alternative back office sites at other company locations 
however  failure to execute or the inability to execute any of the above plans could materially impact the business 
the company may face increasing  competitive pricing pressures on its sales to large chains and consolidated provider groups 
the company s business with large chains and consolidated provider groups  especially in the long term care market  represents a significant portion of its revenue base 
competitive pricing pressures may increase due to change of ownership of the large chains  additional negotiating leverage of large  regional and national chains  vendor agreements containing volume discounts  service specifications  financial health of customers  and activity of competitors 
pricing and customer credit quality pressures due to reduced spending budgets by healthcare providers may affect net sales  the ability to collect accounts receivable  and earnings 
a significant portion of medical care costs in the united states are funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid  and corporate health insurance plans 
in recent years  government imposed limits on reimbursement to hospitals  physicians  nursing homes  and other healthcare providers have significantly impacted spending budgets in certain markets within the medical products industry 
in particular  changes in the medicare program have limited payments to providers in the long term care industry  the principal customers of gulf south medical supply  inc beginning july   medicare s prospective pay system pps was applied to the long term care industry  which limited government payments to long term care providers to federally established cost levels 
under pps  many customers of the elder care business have received reimbursements that were substantially less than what they received under the previous cost based reimbursement system 
as a result of this significant reduction in reimbursement levels and adjustments  a substantial number of national  regional  and independent nursing home facilities entered into bankruptcy 
the united states federal government enacted changes to pps that became effective october  these changes to medicare resulted in the implementation of additions to reimbursement funding for providers of elder care services for a specific period of time referred to as temporary add on payments 
the temporary add on payments were scheduled to expire in september  concurrently with the expected refinement of the rugs during october in may  the us house of representatives and senate voted to delay the october expiration of the rugs and add on reimbursement payments in phases beginning in january and extending through october in may  cms also issued its recommendation to refine the rugs and expand the number of rugs from to  which included an overall reduction in reimbursements for elder care providers beginning in october additionally  cms recommended a market basket increase inflationary related increase that is recommended by cms and modified  approved or not approved by congress annually for all services administered by skilled nursing and other elder care service providers 
the net effect of these changes in reimbursement as recommended by cms  and if approved by congress  is estimated to be essentially neutral or possibly no change in the effective reimbursement rates for fiscal year beginning october  
the final acceptance of cms recommendations is due in august management cannot yet determine the effects  if any  these changes may have on the financial strength of its customers and or the elder care services industry 
future changes in government reimbursement rates  changes in the pps rules  and other regulatory changes may negatively impact the elder care business operations 
any reduction in the reimbursements available to physicians under medicare and medicaid may lead to a corresponding reduction in the spending budgets of physicians  the principal customers of the physician business 

table of contents the elder care business depends on a limited number of large customers 
the elder care business depends on a limited number of large customers for a significant portion of its net sales 
the elder care business has long term contracts with each of its largest customers 
the consolidation or divestiture of a large nursing home facility that results in a loss of a significant  large customer or portion thereof in the elder care business  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  an adverse change in the financial condition of one or more of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the viability of the company s customers may be threatened by increasing costs of malpractice claims and liability insurance 
insurance rates for the customers of the elder care and physician businesses have greatly increased 
if meaningful reform legislation is not adopted or adopted legislation is not effective in reducing these rates  many of the company s customers may be adversely affected which could in turn affect their financial viability 
the company may not be able to continue to compete successfully with other medical supply companies and direct manufacturers 
the medical supply distribution market is highly competitive 
the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected if competitors lower prices of products similar to those distributed by the company  which would require the company to match the competitive pricing or lose sales 
principal competitors of the company include full line and full service multimarket medical distributors and direct manufacturers  many of which have a national presence 
many of these competitors are substantially larger in size  have sales representatives competing directly with the company  have substantially greater financial resources than the company  have lower product costs  and have lower operating costs 
the company also faces significant competition from regional and local dealers  telesales firms  and mail order firms 
several mail order competitors distribute medical supplies on a national  regional or local basis and have less operating costs including lower or no sales tax charges to customers 
continued consolidation within the healthcare industry may lead to increased competition 
consolidation within the healthcare industry has resulted in increased competition by direct manufacturers  large national distributors  and drug wholesalers  and may result in lower customer pricing and or higher operating costs 
the company could face additional competition because many manufacturers are capable of directly marketing to the company s customers  many products can be readily obtained by competitors from various suppliers  competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market a product  national hospital distributors  drug wholesale distributors  and healthcare manufacturers could begin focusing their efforts more directly on the company s markets  hospitals that form alliances with long term care facilities to create integrated healthcare networks may look to hospital distributors and manufacturers to supply their long term care affiliates  and provider networks created through consolidation among physician provider groups  long term care facilities and other alternate site providers may shift purchasing decisions to people with whom the company has no selling relationship 

table of contents there can be no assurance that the company will maintain operating margins if provider consolidations occur or be able to maintain customer relationships and avoid increased competition and significant pricing pressure in the future 
the expansion of the multi tiered pricing structure may place the company at a competitive disadvantage 
the medical products industry is subject to a multi tiered pricing structure  which can vary by manufacturer and or product 
under this structure  certain institutions  originally limited to nonprofit hospitals  can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than the company 
the multi tiered pricing structure continues to expand as many large integrated healthcare providers and others with significant purchasing power  such as gpos  demand more favorable pricing terms 
although the company is seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers  management cannot assure that such terms will be obtained 
the company depends on the availability of lower cost  multi tiered pricing of products 
in order to offset the negative impact of competition and multi tiered pricing  the company depends on the availability of multi tiered priced products from other distributors and customers at costs that are lower than the manufacturers list price 
the reduction of availability of lower product costs will negatively impact the company s gross margins 
the ability to maintain good relations with vendors may affect the company s overall profitability 
currently  the company relies on vendors to provide field sales representatives technical and selling support  acceptable purchasing  pricing  and delivery terms  sales performance incentives  financial support of sales and marketing programs  promotional materials  and product availability 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining good relations with its vendors 
the company depends heavily on unique distributorship agreements and the termination of any agreements could reduce revenues and earnings 
the company distributes over  medical products manufactured by approximately  vendors 
the company relies on these vendors to manufacture and supply these products 
none of the vendors accounted for more than of the company s consolidated inventory purchases during the fiscal years ended april   april   and march  the company must hire and retain qualified sales representatives to continue its sales growth 
the company s ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers is dependent upon hiring new sales representatives and retaining existing sales representatives 
the inability to adequately hire or retain sales representatives could limit the company s ability to expand its business and increase sales 
if a sales representative ceases employment  the company risks the loss of customer goodwill based on the impairment of relationships developed between the sales representative and the company s customers for whom the sales representative was responsible 
this is particularly a risk where the representative goes to work for a competitor 
the company requires sales representatives to execute employment agreements containing restrictive covenants which protect the company s legitimate business interests 
however  these agreements have not been obtained from all sales representatives 
in addition  the terms of these agreements in a limited number of states may not be enforceable 
the company is actively attempting to execute employment agreements with employees that 
table of contents currently do not have agreements in place but the company may not be able to obtain an agreement from each such employee 
the company must retain the services of senior management 
the company s success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of senior management  particularly the executive management team 
the loss of the services of one or more of such individuals may adversely affect the company s business 
because of the decentralized operating infrastructure  the company is also dependent upon the operations and sales managers at each distribution center 
in addition  the company does not maintain any key man insurance for members of its senior management 

table of contents the company s strategy for growth may not result in additional revenue or operating income and may have an adverse effect on working capital  operating cash flow  and earnings 
there can be no assurance that the company s business strategy for growth will result in additional revenues or operating income 
a key component of the company s business strategy is to increase sales to both existing and new customers  including large chains  independent operators  and provider groups 
in addition  these efforts may result in increased costs and expenses to the company without any increase in revenue or operating income 
the company intends to accomplish this by expanding its product offerings  expanding its sales support services  expanding its sales force for home care customers  developing innovative marketing and distribution programs  expanding e commerce initiatives and development  improving distribution capability and efficiency through systems development and implementation  improving supply chain efficiency through centralization and systems implementation  and improving operating margins through a global sourcing strategy which is designed to source high quality  low cost medical products and equipment 
the company s operations and prospects in asia are subject to significant political  economic and legal uncertainties 
the company is currently executing a global sourcing strategic initiative whereby certain products will be purchased directly from asian manufacturers 
the company s business  financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by changes in the political  social or economic environment in asia 
any changes in laws and regulations  or their interpretation  the imposition of surcharges or any material increase in tax rates  restrictions on currency conversion  imports and sources of supply  devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct business 
the operating costs of the company s delivery fleet could increase due to fuel price fluctuations 
the physician and elder care businesses currently operate a delivery fleet of over vehicles 
management considers the deployment of this fleet to be one of the company s competitive advantages 
approximately and of the physician business and the elder care business  respectively  shipments are delivered via the fleet 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to fully pass along any further significant increases in fuel costs to its customers 
in addition  fluctuations in fuel prices impact the operating costs of common carriers who deliver inventory to the company s distribution centers 
these common carriers may attempt to pass fuel related operating costs through to the company as a fuel surcharge that may have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
similarly  strikes or other service interruptions by third party carriers may cause an increase in the company s operating expenses and adversely affect the company s ability to deliver products on a timely basis 
even if the company is able to pass through surcharges to its customers  customers may choose to reduce or defer purchases from the company 
the significant investment in inventory may be exposed to risk of product obsolescence or market valuation 
in order to provide prompt and complete service to customers  the company maintains a significant investment in inventory at the full service and strategic distribution centers 
inventory control procedures and policies are in place to monitor the risk of product obsolescence or declining market prices 
nevertheless  management cannot assure that such procedures and policies will continue to be effective  
table of contents the demand for certain product lines will continue  unforeseen product development or price changes will not occur  or the write off of any unsold inventory in the future will not be significant 
in addition  inventory purchased as a result of a business combination may include different product lines that are not normally distributed by the company 
these product lines may be difficult to sell and  therefore  result in a write off if such inventory is not saleable in the future 
any inventory write offs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
business acquisitions may decrease existing shareholders percentage ownership in the company and or require the company to incur additional debt 
future acquisitions or investments may be financed by the issuance of equity securities that could be dilutive to shareholders 
additionally  the company may incur additional debt and amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets 
this additional debt and amortization expense may significantly reduce profitability and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company is also required to review its intangible assets at least annually to determine if any of these assets have become impaired 
a significant impairment of certain intangible assets could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
if the company has difficulties integrating acquired companies within the business  profitability may be adversely affected 
the company may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated economic  operational  and other benefits in a timely manner 
integration of an acquired business may be difficult when the acquired business is in a market in which the company has limited or no expertise  or has a different corporate culture 
if the company is unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses substantial costs and delays may be incurred  operational  technical  or financial problems may be experienced  management s attention and other resources may be diverted  and relationships with key customers and employees may be damaged 
the company s indebtedness may limit the ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may limit its flexibility to react to industry or economic conditions 
at april   the company has a revolving line of credit with maximum availability of borrowings of million 
availability of borrowings depends upon a borrowing base calculation consisting of accounts receivable and inventory  subject to satisfaction of certain eligibility requirements 
any deterioration in the realizability of these assets could reduce the amount available under the revolving line of credit 
at april   the company had sufficient assets based on eligible inventories and accounts receivable to borrow up to million under the million revolving line of credit  of which million was outstanding 
increases in the level of the company s indebtedness could limit the ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital requirements  limit the ability to make capital expenditures  limit acquisition activity  limit the company s flexibility in reacting to changes in the industry and economic conditions in general  and adversely affect the company s liquidity because a substantial portion of cash flow must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for other purposes 
the company normally meets its operating requirements by i maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity under its revolving line of credit and ii using cash flows from operating activities 
the company expects that the overall growth in the business will be funded through a combination of cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under the revolving line of credit  capital markets  and or other financing arrangements 
however  changes in 
table of contents capital markets or adverse changes to the company s operations may disrupt the company s ability to maintain adequate levels of liquidity 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness  the company will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include the following options reduce or delay acquisitions and capital expenditures  sell assets  restructure or refinance the indebtedness  and seek additional equity capital 
the price of the company s common stock and the trading value of the convertible senior notes may be volatile 
the company s common stock experiences significant price and volume fluctuations 
trading prices of the company s common stock may be influenced by operating results and prospects and by economic  financial  regulatory and other factors 
in addition  general market conditions  including the level of  and fluctuations in  the trading prices of stocks generally  could affect the price of the company s common stock 
the market price of the convertible senior notes is expected to be significantly affected by the market price of the company s common stock as well as the general level of interest rates and our credit quality 
this may result in a significantly greater volatility in the trading value of the notes than would be expected for nonconvertible debt securities the company may issue 
the price of the company s common stock also could be affected by possible sales of the company s common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in the company and by hedging or arbitrage activity that management expects to develop involving the company s common stock as a result of the issuance of the notes 
the hedging or arbitrage could  in turn  affect the trading prices of the notes 
tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect the company s net earnings and tax liabilities 
the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal  state and local governments 
from time to time  various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect the company s tax positions 
there can be no assurance that the company s effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives 
in addition  united states federal  state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
although the company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws  regulations and existing precedent  there can be no assurance that the company s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the company would be successful in any such challenge 
the company faces litigation and liability exposure for existing and potential claims 
the company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business  which are described in note commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the outcomes of such proceedings or claims that are unasserted  pending  or known to be threatened could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity  or results of operations 
the company faces litigation risk exposure to product liability and other claims 
the company s business primarily involves the distribution of pharmaceutical and other medical products and equipment 
there is a risk that an injury or other liability arising from the use or transportation of the products may result in litigation against the company 
accordingly  the company maintains insurance policies  including product liability insurance  covering risks and in amounts management considers adequate 
additionally  in many cases the company is covered by indemnification from the manufacturer of the product 
however  there can be no assurance 
table of contents that the coverage maintained by the company is sufficient to cover future claims  that it will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost  or that indemnification agreements will provide adequate protection for the company 
a successful claim brought against the company in excess of available insurance or indemnification  or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against the company  could harm the company s business 
the company faces risk that proprietary rights may infringe on the rights of third parties 
the company believes that its private label products and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  from time to time  third parties may assert infringement claims against the company 
if the company was found to be infringing on other s rights  the company may be required to pay substantial damage awards  obtain a license  or cease selling the products that contain the infringing property and these actions may be significant and result in material losses 
if environmental claims arise  the company could incur substantial liabilities and costs 
the company s operations and properties are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental matters 
as such  the company may be responsible for the investigation and remediation of property contaminated by hazardous  toxic  or other chemical substances  regardless of whether the company is responsible for such contamination 
the costs of such investigation and remediation requirements may be substantial 
in addition  the company could be held liable to governmental entities or third parties for any property damage  personal injury  and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination 
these costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
management believes that the company s exposure to environmental liabilities under current applicable laws is not material 
however  environmental laws and regulations can change rapidly  which could subject the company to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 
the costs of complying with more stringent standards  as well as any liabilities associated with noncompliance with such standards imposed on the company  may result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if management fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls  the company may not be able to accurately report its financial results 
effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports 
if the company cannot provide reliable financial reports  the business and operating results could be adversely affected 
any failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may cause the company to fail to meet its reporting obligations  which could have a negative impact on the trading price of its stock 
the articles of incorporation  bylaws  rights agreement  and florida law may inhibit a takeover of the company 
the company s amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and florida law contain provisions that may delay  deter  or inhibit a future acquisition 
this could occur even if shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares of common stock or if a substantial number or even a majority of the company s shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with and obtain the approval of the board of directors in connection with any transaction 
a staggered board of directors  the state of florida s affiliated transaction statute  or the state of florida s control share acquisition statute could delay  deter  or inhibit potential offers to acquire the company 
in addition  the rights of holders of the company s common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future and that may be senior to the rights of holders of common stock 
on april   the board of directors approved a shareholder protection rights agreement that provides for one preferred stock purchase right in respect of each share of common stock 
these rights become exercisable upon a person or group of affiliated persons acquiring or more of the company s 
table of contents then outstanding common stock by all persons other than an existing shareholder 
this rights agreement also could discourage bids for shares of common stock at a premium and could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
the company s business  marketing activities  and pricing are subject to review by federal or state agencies 
the health care industry is highly regulated and the company is subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations  which include the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement agency dea  the fda  various state boards of pharmacy  state health departments  the united states department of health and human services hhs  the occupational safety and health administration osha  cms  the state attorney general  state medicaid fraud units  and other comparable agencies 
the company s global sourcing initiatives have increased the company s exposure to these regulatory agencies 
certain of the company s distribution service centers may be required to register for permits and or licenses with  and comply with operating and security standards of  the dea  the fda  hhs  and various state boards of pharmacy  state health departments and or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution  manufacturing  and sale 
although the company believes that it is in compliance  in all material respects  with applicable laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of the company s operations with applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits and licenses or obtain  without significant delay  future permits and licenses needed for the operation of the company s businesses 
the noncompliance by the company with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain  renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if changes were to occur to the laws and regulations applicable to the company s businesses  such changes could adversely affect many of the company s regulated operations  which include distributing pharmaceuticals 
also  the health care regulatory environment may change in a manner that could restrict the company s existing operations  limit the expansion of the company s businesses  apply regulations to previously unregulated businesses or otherwise affect the company adversely 
although the company attempts to comply with law and regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of medical products and supplies  such standards are rapidly developing and often subject to multiple interpretations 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on the company  including criminal and civil penalties  administrative sanctions  fines  and other adverse actions  including but not limited to exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid  and other federal and state health care programs 
the medicare part b billing services provided by the elder care business is subject to review by federal agencies 
during fiscal year  the company acquired a company that provides billing services to the long term care industry 
as a result  the company must comply with medicare and medicaid  other federal health care programs  managed care and third party payor laws and regulations regarding billing  coding  claim submission  and coverage 
failure to comply with the regulations governing medicare medicaid  other federal programs  managed care or third party payor reimbursement or financial reporting  or otherwise committing healthcare fraud  could subject the company to adverse actions by its clients or government or private payors as a result of delays or lost reimbursement  recoupment of amounts previously paid  and could subject the company to substantial fines or penalties  and other sanctions  including exclusion from participation in any federal health care program 
the government is actively involved in investigation of allegations of health care fraud 
in addition  the federal false claims act creates a financial incentive for private individuals  called whistleblowers  to bring suit on behalf of the government to recover funds paid pursuant to a false claim  which may include failure to comply with technical requirements for claim submission  coding  and billing 
an adverse determination regarding the company s compliance with medicare  medicaid  or other federal health care program s billing  coding  claim submission  and coverage requirements  brought by either the government or a private individual  could have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 

table of contents failure to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and other laws could adversely impact the company s competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 
the company is subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act  which generally prohibits united states companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
foreign companies  including some that may compete with the company  are not subject to these prohibitions 
corruption  extortion  bribery  pay offs  theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time to time in the non us countries in which the company conducts business 
the company has attempted to implement safeguards to prevent and discourage such practices by employees and agents 
the company can make no assurance  however  that employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which the company might be held responsible 
if employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices  the company could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is also subject to the patriot act and other anti boycott and reporting laws 
failure to comply with these laws could subject the company  its employees or other agents to penalties and other adverse consequences that may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the objective in managing the company s exposure to market risk is to limit the potential impact to earnings and cash flow from changes in interest rates and availability of capital 
the following assessment of the company s market risk does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political uncertainty  economic uncertainty  impact of future tax legislation  and credit risks 
the company s primary interest rate exposure relates to cash  fixed and variable rate debt  and a single interest rate swap 
interest rate sensitivity 
during fiscal year  the company s debt obligations consisted of i the million of convertible senior notes and ii borrowings under the revolving line of credit  which currently bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin of between and based on the company s ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization leverage ratio  as defined in the amended credit agreement  or at libor plus an applicable margin of between and based on the company s leverage ratio 
the company completed the sale of the convertible senior notes on march  the proceeds were used to repurchase million shares of the company s common stock and repay approximately million outstanding under the company revolving line of credit 
the remaining proceeds were available for general corporate purposes 
the repayment of a portion of the outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit eliminated a majority of the company s floating rate debt and replaced it with long term debt with interest at a fixed rate 
during fiscal year  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variable interest rate of its revolving line of credit 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  the company makes payments based on the fixed rate and will receive interest payments based on month libor 
the changes in market value of this financial instrument are highly correlated with changes in market value of the hedged item both at inception and over the life of the agreement 
amounts received or paid under the interest rate swap agreement are recorded as reductions or additions to interest expense 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company s interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge with changes in fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
on july   the company elected to reduce the notional amount of the interest rate swap from million to million 
accordingly  during fiscal year  the company reclassified a gain of million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense related to the portion of the swap that was terminated 

table of contents as of april   the swap carries a notional principal amount of million and effectively fixes the interest rate on a portion of the revolving line of credit to  prior to applying the leverage ratio margin discussed above 
the swap agreement expires on march  and settles monthly until expiration 
during fiscal year  the company recorded an unrealized gain  net of related tax effects  of approximately million for the estimated fair value of the swap agreement in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the unrealized loss  net of related tax effects  recorded during fiscal year was immaterial 
changes in interest rates affect interest payments under the company s variable rate revolving line of credit agreement 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
changes in interest rates also affect rates of return on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments  which generally consist of money market accounts  commercial paper  and government securities 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million of short term investments 
due to the short term nature of the company s investments  typically less than day maturities  the impact of a similar basis point change in interest rates would have an immaterial impact on the carrying value of an investment 
commodity prices 
the company currently has exposure to commodity risk related to the cost of fuel 
product is delivered to customers either by a third party carrier or the company owned delivery fleet 
significant increases in the cost of fuel impact the operating costs of common carriers and would have a material effect on the company s operating expenses 
common carriers may pass fuel related operating costs through to the company as a fuel surcharge 
however  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to fully pass along any further significant increases in fuel costs to its customers due to the competitive nature of the medical supply distribution industry
