the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we were formed in february as a maryland real estate investment trust to capitalize on the growing trend toward privatization in the corrections industry by acquiring correctional and detention facilities from both private prison operators and government entities and leasing these facilities to experienced correctional and detention facility operators or the government entities under long term  non cancelable  triple net leases leases where the tenant is required to pay all operating expenses  taxes  insurance  structural and non structural repairs and other costs 
except where the context otherwise requires  the terms we  us  company or our refer to the business of correctional properties trust and its consolidated subsidiaries 
our principal business strategy is to finance and or acquire correctional and detention facilities that meet our investment criteria  from private prison owners and operators  developers and government entities  to expand our existing facilities  and to lease all of these facilities under long term triple net leases to qualified third party operators 
our facilities are privately managed facilities that are leased to and operated by the geo group  inc  or the geo group  or community educations center  inc  or cec 
we lease eleven of our facilities to the geo group or its subsidiary and one of our facilities to cec 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from i rents received under triple net leases of correctional and detention facilities  and ii interest earned from the temporary investment of funds in short term investments 
a component of the rental revenue we receive consists of increases resulting from rent escalation provisions which appear in all of our leases the geo group leases 
the base rent for the first year of each facility leased to the geo group before january  was equal to of the facility purchase price 
after the first year  minimum rent escalates by the greater of or the increase in the consumer price index  or cpi  with a maximum increase of for the first two annual anniversaries of the effective date of each lease and  for each successive annual anniversary for the remaining term of each lease  by an amount equal to increases  if any  in the cpi  subject to a maximum increase of per annum throughout the term of the leases 
the base rent for the first year of the jena juvenile justice center in jena  louisiana leased to the geo group was equal to of the facility purchase price with a fixed annual escalator 
the average remaining life on the eleven leases with the geo group as of december   is approximately years 

table of contents community education centers lease 
on may   we acquired delaney hall 
the initial base rent was  per annum or of the facility purchase price 
following the first year and continuing during the term of the lease  base rent will increase by annually on each anniversary 
we incur operating and administrative expenses  including compensation expense for our executive officers and other employees  office rental and related occupancy costs and various expenses incurred in the process of acquiring additional properties 
we are self administered and managed by our executive officers and staff  and do not engage a separate advisor or pay an advisory fee for administrative or investment services  although we do engage legal  accounting  tax and financial advisors from time to time 
our primary non cash expense is depreciation of our correctional and detention facilities 
all facilities owned by us are leased under triple net leases  which require the lessees to pay substantially all expenses associated with the operation of these facilities 
as a result of these arrangements  we do not believe we will be responsible for any major expenses in connection with the facilities during the terms of the leases 
we have leveraged and anticipate continuing to leverage our portfolio of real estate equity investments  and expect to continue to incur short term indebtedness and related interest expense 
we may also incur long term indebtedness to make acquisitions  and or refinance correctional facilities currently owned 
we intend to make distributions to our shareholders in amounts not less than the amounts required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust  or reit  under the internal revenue code 
our cash flows from operating activities are dependent on the continued leasing of our properties  the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants  the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments  our ability to renew our leases with our existing tenants as they expire and our ability to re lease our properties with other suitable tenants if our leases are not renewed by our existing tenants 
a principal long term risk to our business is our dependence on the viability of our tenants  the geo group and cec 
any of the following could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows from operating activities and income from operating activities we are subject to lease payment collection risks because our lease agreements are for longer terms than those of the facility management services or operating agreements held by and which generate revenue for the geo group and cec 
only a governmental agency that has contracted with the geo group and cec may exercise a renewal option of an existing management services or operating agreement or enter into a new management services or operating agreement 
a governmental agency may choose to terminate or not renew an operating agreement or management services agreement 
for example  the operating agreement for the jena facility has been terminated 
the non renewal of a facility management services or operating agreement and the inability to secure an alternate agreement or source of inmates could materially and adversely affect the geo group s or cec s financial condition and their respective ability to make lease payments to us 
the geo group and its subsidiary and cec are currently the only parties with whom we have lease agreements on our facilities 
accordingly  these parties account for of our lease agreement revenue and the failure of either one of them to meet their respective obligations to us may have a material adverse effect upon our operations 
the geo group is either the lessee or sub lessee of of the facilities we own 
as of december   approximately of our revenue  and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders  will depend substantially upon the geo group making rent payments and satisfying its obligations to us 
any failure or delay by the geo group in making rent payments or otherwise complying with its obligations under these leases may adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities and income from operating activities and our ability to make anticipated distributions 
eight of our leases with the geo group expire during april to the extent these leases are not renewed by the geo group or re leased to other suitable tenants on acceptable terms  our total revenue and ability to make distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected 
we may finance  purchase or lease properties for long term investment  expand and improve the facilities presently owned or sell these properties  in whole or in part  when circumstances warrant 
we may also participate with other entities in 
table of contents property ownership  through joint ventures or other types of co ownership 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness which have priority over our equity interest 
while we emphasize equity real estate investments  we may  in our discretion  invest in mortgages  equity or debt securities of other reits or partnerships and other real estate interests 
mortgage investments may include participating in convertible mortgages 
there are no current limitations on the percentage of our assets that may be invested in any one property  venture or type of security 
our board of trustees may establish investment limitations as it deems appropriate from time to time  including investment limitations necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 
no limitations have been set on the number of properties in which we will seek to invest or on the concentration of investments in any one geographic region 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets and liabilities 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  depreciation of real estate  impairment of long lived assets  and the accounting for interest rate swaps and stock options 
application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and  as a result  future results could differ from these estimates 
for additional information  please see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
revenue recognition lease revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term including the impact of scheduled rent increases which are determinable in amount at the inception of the lease 
any increases in lease revenue due to scheduled rent increases which were not determinable at the inception of the lease will be recognized when determinable 
scheduled rent increases which are not determinable at lease inception are dependent upon increases in the cpi 
depreciation of real estate real estate properties are recorded at cost 
acquisition costs and transaction fees directly related to each property are capitalized as a cost of the respective property 
the purchase price of properties is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their respective values in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which was effective july  the tangible cost of real estate properties acquired is allocated between land  buildings and improvements  and machinery and equipment based upon the relative fair value of each component at the time of acquisition 
depreciation is provided for on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life ranging from years for buildings and improvements 
the intangible costs of real estate properties are allocated to above or below market in place leases and other lease origination costs 
these intangible costs are amortized over the remaining term of the corresponding leases 
we are required to make subjective evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our properties  which directly impact our net income 
impairment of long lived assets we review the recorded value of our real estate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset in question may not be recoverable 
we have reviewed our long lived assets and have determined that there are no events requiring impairment loss recognition 
the method used to determine impairment would be based on estimates of undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated from the related long lived assets 
we would measure impairment as the difference between fair value and the net book value of the related asset 
interest rate swaps in accordance with the amended bank credit facility  we utilize interest rate swap derivative instruments to manage changes in market conditions related to interest rate payments on certain of our variable rate bank debt obligations 
these interest rate swaps exchange floating interest rate libor payments on specified established notional amounts for fixed rate interest payments on the same notional amounts 
we recognize our interest rate swap derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value  which is determined by the counter party  as either an asset or a liability 
changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps  which are 
table of contents determined to be effective cash flow hedges  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a component of shareholders equity 
stock options we account for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for our stock plans because the exercise prices of the stock options equal the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant 
had compensation for our stock based compensation plans been determined pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  our net income and earnings per share would have decreased accordingly

financial condition results of operations on november   the company completed the sale of the pamlico facility and mountain view facility to the state of north carolina  and using the net proceeds from the sale and a substantial portion of the balance of the debt service fund  repaid all of the outstanding balance of the bonds at par which were issued in to finance these facilities 
in july  the company received written notice from the state of north carolina of the exercise of its option to purchase the pamlico facility and the mountain view facility  both of which were owned by a subsidiary of the company  and leased to the state of north carolina 
as a result of the sale  certain amounts in our prior years consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued operation presentation including reclassifying the assets and liabilities associated with the pamlico facility and mountain view facility as held for sale for prior periods  and reporting the results of operations associated with such facilities for both current and prior periods as discontinued operations 
the discontinued operations line item in the consolidated statements of income includes rental income  interest income and the net gain on the sale less depreciation expense recorded prior to the classification of the facilities as held for sale  interest expense on the bonds used to finance the facilities and general and administrative expenses directly associated with both the pamlico facility and the mountain view facility 
we recognized a combined net gain on the sale of these facilities of approximately  for financial reporting purposes in the fourth quarter of  however  future results of operations and cash flows from operating activities will be negatively impacted because we will no longer receive the monthly rental income after the date of the sale of the facilities 
for additional information  please see note discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
compared with for the twelve months ended december   rental revenues increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in rental revenues resulted primarily from the acquisition of delaney hall on may   which increased rental revenue in by approximately  the balance of the increase was primarily due to rent escalations  based on the consumer price index  on some of the remaining facilities 
depreciation for the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  depreciation associated with the delaney hall facility resulted in the increase in depreciation from to general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional fees of  an increase in salaries and benefits of  an increase in insurance expense of  and an increase in board of trustee fees of  
table of contents interest expense decreased to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest on our amended bank credit facility as a result of the paying down of the outstanding balance in july using the proceeds from the secondary public offering 
income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to  for the same period in the increase is primarily due to a net gain of  recognized in on the sale of the mountain view facility and pamlico facility and a reduction in depreciation expense in as a result of the pamlico facility and the mountain view facility no longer being depreciated during the period the facilities were classified as held for sale  which was from july until the sale date in november compared with for the twelve months ended december   rental revenues increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in rental revenues resulted primarily from the acquisition of delaney hall on may   which increased rental revenue by  the balance of the increase was primarily due to rent escalations  based on the consumer price index  on some of the remaining facilities of approximately  and a one time  cumulative non recurring cpi rent escalation adjustment of approximately  on certain of the facilities leased to the geo group 
depreciation for the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  depreciation associated with the delaney hall facility resulted in the increase in depreciation from to general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits of  an increase in insurance of  an increase in professional fees of  and an increase in board of trustee fees of  interest expense decreased to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest on our amended bank credit facility as a result of the paying down of the outstanding balance in july using the proceeds from the secondary public offering 
income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period in the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in interest income 
liquidity and capital resources our short term liquidity requirements normally consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for general and administrative expenses including payroll and costs of legal  accounting and other professionals  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt  capital expenditures incurred to facilitate the leasing of space  the expansion of existing facilities and quarterly dividends and other distributions paid to our common shareholders 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to holders of our common shares on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely that we will retain any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities 
we believe that our net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to allow us to make distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
all facilities owned by us are leased under triple net leases  which require the lessees to pay substantially all expenses associated with the operation of these facilities 
as a result of these arrangements  we do not believe we will be responsible for any major expenses in connection with the facilities during the terms of the leases 
we currently have an amended bank credit facility consisting of a million secured revolving credit facility 
the proceeds of the amended bank credit facility may be used to finance the construction and the acquisition of correctional and 
table of contents detention facilities  to expand or improve current facilities and for general working capital purposes 
the amended bank credit facility includes a swing line component and provisions to increase the amended bank credit facility up to a total of million by increasing the revolver  and or by originating a new term loan of up to million  subject to successful syndication and other specified closing conditions 
the amended bank credit facility is secured by our facilities  other than the queens facility  and permits aggregate borrowings of up to of the total value of the facilities  known as the pledge pool  which is calculated as the lesser of the aggregate of the historical cost of our facilities or the aggregate of the appraised value of those facilities 
under the terms of the amended bank credit facility  we are restricted from paying dividends in excess of a the lesser of of cash available for distribution or of funds from operations plus  in either case b of the amount of any capital gain from dispositions of facilities 
the amended bank credit facility includes a requirement that we enter into specified interest rate swap agreements for a portion of the amounts drawn  which effectively fixes the interest rate on a significant portion of the borrowings 
as of december   the company has no amounts drawn  and no interest rate swap agreements in effect 
our ability to borrow under the amended bank credit facility is subject to our compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative restrictive covenants and other requirements including certain financial covenants with respect to our consolidated net worth and interest coverage ratio and limits on capital expenditures and borrowings in addition to other restrictions 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  borrowings under the amended bank credit facility bear interest at either a base rate or eurodollar rate at our option 
the base rate is equal to the sum of a the higher of i the federal funds rate plus basis points and ii the prime rate plus b the base rate applicable margin  which ranges from to basis points depending upon our ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated total assets 
the eurodollar rate is equal to libor plus the eurodollar rate applicable margin  which ranges from to basis points depending upon our ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated total assets 
the interest period on eurodollar rate loans may be one  two  three  six or nine months at our option 
the applicable margins for base rate loans and eurodollar rate loans described above were and basis points at december   respectively 
the company is required to pay on a quarterly basis an unused fee under the amended bank credit facility  which ranges from to basis points depending upon the ratio of consolidated total liabilities to consolidated total assets  on the amount by which the available borrowing capacity exceeds the amounts outstanding 
the unused fee at december  was basis points 
economic conditions could result in higher interest rates  which could increase debt service requirements on borrowings under the amended bank credit facility and which could  in turn  reduce the amount of cash available for distribution 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the million amended bank credit facility 
as of december   we had million of available borrowing capacity  including million available to be drawn on the swing line component for general working capital requirements 
in order for a facility to be initially included in the pledge pool  the lessee of the facility must be in full compliance with the material terms and conditions contained in the operating or management contract with the governmental agency 
however  in the event that any facility  after becoming a part of the pledge pool  becomes vacant that property shall continue to be included in the pledge pool so long as the lease agreement with respect to such property is in full force and effect and the inclusion of that property in the pledge pool would not cause the sum of the appraised values of all vacant properties in the pledge pool to exceed of the total value of the pledge pool as calculated above 
the geo group does not presently have a correctional facility operating or management contract with a governmental agency for the jena facility 
however  the geo group continues to make rental payments to us as required under the terms of the non cancelable lease 
the appraised value of the jena facility is approximately seven percent of the total value of the facilities as calculated above  and therefore  does not exceed of the total value 
as a result  the jena facility continues to be included in the pledge pool 
each of our facilities are leased under triple net leases in which the tenant is required to pay all the operating expenses  taxes  insurance  and structural and non structural repairs and other costs 
as a result  we have no commitments with respect to other capital expenditures on our existing facilities 
we have an agreement under which we may acquire  at a price of up to of cost  and lease back to the geo group  any correctional or detention facility acquired or developed and owned by the geo group  subject to specified limited exceptions  and subject to time constraints on each specific property 
currently there are no properties of the geo group eligible for purchase pursuant to this agreement 

table of contents our long term liquidity requirements customarily consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures and significant non recurring capital expenditures that may need to be made periodically at our properties if the properties are not subject to a lease agreement  and the costs associated with acquisitions of properties as well as the expansion of existing facilities 
historically  we have satisfied these long term liquidity requirements through what we believe to be the most advantageous source of capital available at the time  which has included borrowing under our amended bank credit facility and by issuing equity or debt securities in public or private transactions 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available in the future to fund our long term capital needs 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain financing for our long term capital needs 
however  we cannot assure you that this additional financing or capital will be available on terms acceptable to us 
we may  under some circumstances  borrow additional amounts in connection with the renovation or expansion of facilities  the acquisition of additional properties  or as necessary  to meet certain distribution requirements imposed on reits under the internal revenue code 
our ability to incur additional debt may be affected by a number of factors  including the terms and conditions of our facility leases  the underlying operating and management services agreement between the government entities and our lessees  our degree of leverage  the appraised value of our properties  the credit quality of lessees  the value of our unencumbered assets  and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders 
on june   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  under rule under the securities act of  as amended 
subject to the effectiveness of this registration statement at the time of the offering  we may  from time to time  offer our common shares  preferred shares  debt securities  which may be senior or subordinated  depositary shares and warrants to acquire any of the foregoing 
these securities may only be offered in amounts  at prices and on terms to be set forth in the prospectus contained in the effective registration statement  and in one or more supplements to the prospectus 
the registration statement is intended to provide us flexibility to raise up to million from the offering of these securities  subject to market conditions and capital needs 
we currently have approximately million available for issuance under the shelf registration statement subject to its effectiveness at the time of the offering 
net proceeds from the offering may be used by us to acquire correctional properties  repay outstanding debt  and for general working capital purposes 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table aggregates our expected contractual obligations and commitments after december  payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years debt operating lease the operating lease in the table above is for our corporate office space which we lease at annual rent of approximately  plus operating expenses 
the term of our lease expires on july  we are currently reviewing various alternatives in connection with our corporate office space including the renewal or extension of our existing lease 
at december   we did not have any outstanding debt 
additionally  at december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
funds from operations we believe funds from operations  or ffo  is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
we compute ffo in accordance with the current standards established by the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits  and accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the white paper defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for 
table of contents unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands net income real estate depreciation real estate depreciation included in discontinued operations gain on sale of facilities funds from operations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks inherent in our financial instruments 
these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and relate to our acquisitions and financing of correctional and detention facilities 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our existing amended bank credit facility and any future financing requirements 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with the amended bank credit facility agreement and board approved policies 
our interest rate risk is related primarily to the variable rates of our amended bank credit facility  which we seek to reduce by entering into the interest rate swaps 
we are also exposed to market risk from i the interest rate risk on short term borrowings  ii the possibility of non performance by the counter parties to the interest rate swaps  iii our ability to refinance our amended bank credit facility at maturity and iv the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate financing to fund our existing properties and future acquisitions 
while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt  we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis and may in the future seek to minimize interest rate exposure 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective  we may from time to time enter into interest rate swaps and seek long term financing 
as of december   no funds were drawn on the amended bank credit facility and  as such  we had no interest rate swaps in effect
