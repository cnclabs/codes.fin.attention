business we develop  manufacture  and market products for the detection  treatment  monitoring  and tracking of common medical disorders in newborns 
currently  our principal product lines consist of our algo screening products for hearing screening  our echo screen oae device for hearing screening in newborns and hearing monitoring in young children and adults  our neoblue led line of phototherapy devices neoblue phototherapy devices for the treatment of newborn jaundice  our neometrics newborn screening data management system  our minimuffs neonatal noise attenuators minimuffs products for the attenuation of noise for newborns  and the nascor product line 
our revenue is generated almost exclusively from the sale of supplies and services  which are generally recurring  and related devices and systems 
supplies and services revenue results from sales of supplies for our algo and echo screen medical devices  the nascor product line of heatshields and oxygen delivery hoods  software maintenance agreements for our neometrics data management system  as well extended service agreements on our medical devices 
devices and systems revenue results from the sale of our algo  echo screen  and neoblue medical devices  and installations of our neometrics newborn screening data management system 
year overview during natus strengthened and reorganized its management team 
in june the company implemented a cost reduction plan and in the third quarter completed the acquisition of fischer zoth and divestiture of neogenesis 
for the first time since the company s initial public offering in july  and largely as a result of these actions  in the second half of the company reported two consecutive quarters of profitability 
james b 
hawkins joined natus in april as president and chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors 
mr 
hawkins brings to natus years of combined medical device and financial 
table of contents management experience  most recently as president and chief executive officer of invivo corporation nasdaq safe 
invivo corporation  a maker of multi parameter vital sign monitoring equipment used in hospitals  was acquired in early by intermagnetics general corporation nasdaq imgc 
we entered into a transition agreement and release with our former chief executive officer in january 
in june we implemented an operating cost reduction plan that resulted in an immediate reduction of employees including changes to our senior management team 
the actions we undertook in june had a significant impact on our ability to report income from continuing operations of million in the second half of in june we announced our intent to divest the neogenesis line of products  which were acquired in july as part of our acquisition of neometrics 
the divestiture was completed in and we do not expect to record additional losses from discontinued operations related to this line of products 
in september  we purchased for million in cash  including direct costs of the acquisition  and potential future earnout payments  all the common stock of privately held fischer zoth  located near munich  germany  as well as intangible assets held individually by the owners of fischer zoth 
founded in  fischer zoth develops  manufacturers  and markets its echo screen oae products for the detection and assessment of hearing disorders 
fischer zoth s oae products utilize proprietary  patented signal processing analysis software and are used in conjunction with a disposable supply 
we estimate that approximately to of the children born in the us are currently being tested for hearing prior to discharge from the hospital 
in the united states we sell our products in a maturing  competitive market 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our screening devices 
because these products can generate high margins  we will likely face increasing competition 
we believe that our primary competitive advantage relates to the functionality and reliability of our products and we expect that our competitors will seek to mitigate this advantage by offering lower prices 
we sell our products through a direct sales force in the us and the us  and to distributors in over other countries 
we intend to continue expansion of our international operations because we believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity 
international sales made to distributors are characterized by lower gross margins due to the discount the distributors receive from our list prices 
international sales accounted for of our revenue during  of our revenue during  and of our revenue during we anticipate that international revenue will increase as a percent of revenue in the future 
our net income or loss can be markedly impacted by the decisions of management regarding the level of resources applied to our business 
management and our board of directors make these decisions on the basis of sales forecasts  expected customer orders  economic conditions  and other factors 
these costs are primarily personnel and facilities costs that are relatively fixed in the short term and directly impact net income 
as of december   we had total federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods  these net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in and continuing through if we continue to have net losses  we may not be able to utilize some or all of our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
in addition  us income tax law imposes limitations on the amount of net operating loss carry forwards we can use in any given year and on the ability to use net operating loss carry forwards if we experience a more than change in ownership during any three year period 
application of critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in so doing  we must often make estimates and use assumptions that can be subjective  and 
table of contents consequently our actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  and judgments could have a material affect on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures as of the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of discounts  from sales of medical devices  and supplies  including sales to distributors  when a purchase order has been received  when title transfers generally upon shipment  when the selling price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
terms of sales to distributors are exw  an international incoterm  reflecting that goods are shipped ex works  in which title and risk of loss are assumed by the distributor at the shipping point 
revenue from our neometrics newborn screening data management system  which is generally highly customized  is recognized on the percentage of completion basis over the development and implementation period of the associated installation  which typically ranges from six to eighteen months 
revenue from extended service and maintenance agreements  for both medical devices and data management systems  is recognized ratably over the service period 
advance payments from customers are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as otherwise described above 
we generally do not provide rights of return on products 
we accept trade ins of our own and competitive medical devices 
trade ins are recorded as a reduction of the replacement medical device sale 
provisions are made for initial standard warranty obligations of one year  and post sale training and customer support at the time the related revenue is recognized 
more than of the hospitals in the us are members of group purchasing organizations gpo s  which negotiate volume purchase prices for member hospitals  group practices  and other clinics 
we have entered into agreements with several group purchasing organizations  which typically contain preferential terms for the gpo and its members  including provisions for some if not all of the following negotiated pricing for all group members  volume discounts and other preferential terms on their member s direct purchases from us  promotion of natus products by the gpo to its members  payment of marketing fees by natus to the gpo  usually based on purchasing experience of group members  and non recourse cancellation provisions 
gpo s do not generally purchase products from us 
hospitals  group practices  and other clinics that are members of gpo s purchase products directly from us under the terms negotiated by the gpo 
negotiated pricing and discounts are recognized as a reduction of the selling price of our products rather than an expense 
revenue from sales to members of gpo s is otherwise consistent with our general revenue recognition policies as described previously 
we must exercise judgment when assessing the sufficiency of our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
our estimates are based on our historical collection experience within the markets in which we operate as well as assessment of our average accounts receivable aging days and any other specific information of which we may be aware  such as bankruptcy filings or liquidity problems of our customers 
any future determination that our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable is understated could result in increased operating expense and reduce our results of operations 

table of contents at december  our deferred revenue under extended service and maintenance agreements  and billings in excess of recognized revenue on percentage of completion contracts was approximately  other advance payments from customers were not material at december  our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable was  at december  inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market value as a medical device manufacturer  we may be exposed to a number of factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  competitive pressures in products and prices  and our own introduction of new product lines 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including historical usage rates  forecasted sales  product life cycles  and market acceptance of new products 
when we identify inventory that is obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage we write it down to realizable salvage value or provide for inventory valuation reserves 
the estimates we use in projecting future product demand may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our inventory is overvalued could result in increases to our cost of sales and decreases to our operating margins and results of operations 
carrying value of intangible assets we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their useful lives  any future changes that would limit their useful lives or any determination that these assets are carried at amounts greater than their fair value could result in additional charges 
we carry goodwill and any other intangible assets with indefinite lives at original cost but do not amortize them  any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their fair value could result in additional charges 
we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on october st of each year  however  this assessment may take place at any time in the event of changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
similarly  we test our definite lived intangible assets whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  net book value as compared to market capitalization  significant negative industry and economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical and projected future operating results 
impairment is considered to have occurred when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than its carrying value 
estimates of future cash flows involve consideration of many factors including the marketability of new products  product acceptance and lifecycle  competition  appropriate discount rates  and operating margins 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges which could have a significant impact on our operating results 
at december  we have goodwill and intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately million 
liability for product warranties our medical device products are covered by standard one year product warranty plans 
a liability has been established for the expected cost of servicing our products during these service periods 
we base the liability in part upon our historical experience  however  estimates of the costs to honor our warranties are often difficult to determine due to uncertainty surrounding the extent to which new products will require servicing and the costs that will be incurred to service those products 
until we have historical experience of the cost to honor warranties on new products  we base additions to the reserve on a combination of factors including the standard cost of the product  experience with similar products  and other judgments  such as the degree to which the product incorporates new technology 
the estimates we use in projecting future product warranty costs may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our product warranty reserves are understated could result in increases to our cost of sales and reductions in our operating margins and results of operations 

table of contents at december  our reserve for product warranties is approximately valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which result primarily from net operating loss and credit carry forwards that expire over time  and temporary differences between book and tax results that will reverse in the future 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  or increase this allowance in a period  we include an offsetting expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
future income generation in these tax jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and additional income recognition 
at december   our net deferred tax assets were zero  net of a million valuation allowance 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue

although the employee reductions came from production  marketing and sales  research and 
table of contents development  and administrative  approximately of the costs associated with the restructuring came from administrative  and business development  which is a component of marketing and sales 
the remainder of the charge was associated with the liquidation of the company s sales subsidiary in japan  which was substantially completed in substantially all of the costs associated with the restructuring were recorded in the second quarter of  and the company does not expect to incur further costs associated with the restructuring 
additional financial information about the restructuring is set forth in note restructuring charges of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
our revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue from devices and systems grew to million in from million in approximately million  or of the increase  was attributable to sales of the company s neoblue line of phototherapy lights  including the new neoblue mini product  which was introduced in september the balance of the increase came from sales of hearing screening devices  including million from the echo screen oae device  which natus gained through its recent acquisition of fischer zoth  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from installations of the neometrics metabolic screening database systems 
revenue from supplies and services increased  or  to million in from million in substantially all of the revenue increases mentioned above  and in the narrative to follow  were from increased unit sales of our products  as average selling prices remained relatively stable among most of our product lines 
revenue from supplies and services were of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in no end customer accounted for more than of our revenue in either or revenue from sales outside the us was million for  up million  or from million for the most significant increase came from sales in the uk and europe where revenue in increased by million to million 
the increase was led by million of sales of the echo screen oae device  which we gained through our acquisition of fischer zoth 
the increase in sales in the uk and europe was offset by lower sales in asia 
international sales of devices and systems increased million to million  and international sales of supplies and services remained stable at million 
while unit sales of algo supplies increased  the increase was offset by a reduction in average selling prices in our international markets 
in particular  a change in our distribution method in japan  where we ceased direct sales and began to sell through a distributor  has resulted in lower average selling prices of algo supplies in that country 
however  the reduction in revenue is offset by an approximate  decrease in our operating expenses in japan 
our cost of revenue increased  or  to million in up from million in gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of revenue improved marginally to in from in our marketing and selling expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in approximately  of the reduction was related to the winding down and subsequent liquidation of our japan sales subsidiary  which was substantially completed in management believes that the company will continue to benefit from the cost savings resulting from the liquidation of the japan sales subsidiary 
additional cost savings resulted from the substantial completion in of a program to transition customers to the new cable used with our algo flexicoupler supply products 
costs associated with advertising  promotion and public relations were also reduced by approximately  in these cost reductions were offset by increased costs associated with the operations of fischer zoth  which we acquired in september  and neometrics  which we acquired in july our research and development expenses were flat at million in and we experienced reductions in personnel and outside service costs of approximately  in our domestic operations exclusive of the neometrics business 
these reductions were offset by costs associated with our neometrics and fischer zoth operations 
in january the company entered into a transition agreement and release with the company s former chief executive officer 
pursuant to the agreement  the company and the executive agreed on the terms and 
table of contents conditions of termination of his employment with the company and for an orderly transition of his employment duties to his successor  who was hired in april the agreement also contains a severance agreement providing for payment of the executive s then current salary and medical benefits for eighteen months thereafter 
we recorded charges of  related to the severance benefits as well as  of stock compensation related to a modification of the terms of certain stock options granted to the individual 
our general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in costs associated with the transition of the company s former ceo  as mentioned above  contributed to  of the increase 
in addition we incurred costs of approximately  related to the search for a new ceo 
management believes that those costs are non recurring in nature 
we also experienced increases in costs of outside consultants and insurance as well as increased administrative costs associated with neometrics and fischer zoth 
we recorded  of costs associated with an in process research and development ipr d project related to our acquisition of fischer zoth 
the project further develops the capabilities of fischer zoth s existing proprietary automated otoacoustic emissions technology for use as an automated hearing diagnostic tool 
we valued the technology using an excess earnings approach over a ten year projection period 
although the project is currently in a clinical testing phase  we consider the project to have significant risk and do not at this time know whether the project will result in a commercially viable product 
we recorded aggregate amortization of  of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenue   of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenue  and  of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenue 
deferred stock compensation  which was related to the grant of stock options to employees during the year ended december  has been fully amortized as of december  net other income expense consists of investment income  interest expense  currency gains and losses  and other items  and decreased  or  to  in from  in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment income caused by both reduced interest rates and lower average cash balances 
in january  we began notifying customers that we will no longer support our co stat end tidal breath analyzer  a device that we developed to provide clinicians with a tool that measures the rate of hemolysis  or red blood cell breakdown  in newborns 
to that end  we initiated a plan to remove from service all units currently in use by customers  which was substantially completed in we realized only limited sales from our co stat product since its introduction in and do not expect that this action will have a material impact on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
in june the company announced its intent to divest the neogenesis line of products  which were acquired in july  as part of our acquisition of neometrics 
on september  the neogenesis line of products was sold to a privately held company 
assets with a book value of approximately  were sold for  cash and a  promissory note payable in equal monthly payments of approximately  beginning april and continuing through october  at which time the balance of  becomes due 
the entire value of the promissory note was reserved for because of the uncertainty of its collectability 
in  we reported a loss from discontinued operations of million 
the divestiture of the neogenesis line of products was completed in and do not expect to record additional losses from discontinued operations 
segment results we currently operate in two reportable segments  our medical devices and related supplies segment and our software systems segment 
management considers the costs associated with the transition of the company s former ceo and costs associated with the restructuring initiatives implemented in june  which are more 
table of contents fully described in note restructuring charges of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report  to be non recurring  and those costs have been excluded from the discussion and analysis of the results of our reportable segments 
additional financial information about our segments  including a reconciliation of segment operating results to consolidated operating results  is set forth in note segment  customer  and geographic information of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
medical devices and related supplies revenue from our medical devices and related supplies segment increased by million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was attributable to sales of the company s neoblue line of phototherapy lights for the treatment of newborn jaundice  which were initially introduced in october  including the new neoblue mini product  which was introduced in september the balance of the increase came from sales of hearing screening devices  including million from the echo screen oae device  which natus gained through its acquisition of fischer zoth in september the medical device and related supplies segment reported income from operations of million in  including approximately million of depreciation and amortization costs 
the segment reported a loss from operations of million in  including approximately million of depreciation and amortization costs 
the results in were favorably impacted by reduced costs of operating our japan sales subsidiary as well as cost reductions resulting from the restructuring initiatives implemented in mid in addition  operating results of fischer zoth were immediately accretive to earnings 
software systems our software systems segment consists substantially of the operations of our neometrics business unit  which we acquired in july segment results for therefore reflect the operations for only six months 
revenue from our software systems segment increased by million  or  to million in  from million in the increase primarily reflects the contribution of the full year compared to only six months in we derive revenue in our software systems segment from systems installations and maintenance of those installations 
revenue from system installations represented of total segment revenue in compared to in several large systems installations were substantially completed in the period and fewer systems installations were implemented in revenue from systems installations is generally non recurring and may show more variance from year to year than revenue from maintenance  which is largely recurring 
the software systems segment reported a loss from operations of  in  including approximately  of depreciation and amortization costs 
the segment reported a loss from operations of  in  including approximately  of depreciation and amortization costs 
several factors contributed to the unfavorable results in during the year  we transitioned several customers from dos based to windows based operating systems 
these system conversions generated lower than average profit margins  however  we believe that the transition to windows based systems will allow us to maintain and upgrade these systems in a more efficient manner in the future 
in addition  we performed other development work on several msds systems that was not profitable for us related to contractual obligations existing prior to our acquisition of the neometrics business unit in july we also implemented some management changes in the second half of the year 
we believe the above mentioned factors have been substantially resolved as of december  we expect that revenue from installations of our neometrics data management suite may fluctuate from year to year 
comparison of and our revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the neometrics line of business contributed to million of the increase  with the remainder resulting from 
table of contents increased sales of algo supplies and neoblue devices 
revenue from devices and systems increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue from supplies and services increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue from supplies and services was of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in no end customer accounted for more than of our revenue in either or revenue from sales outside the us was million for  up million from million for revenue from europe increased million to million in  revenue from oceania increased  to  in  and revenue from asia increased  to million in international sales of devices and systems increased million to million  and international sales of supplies and services increased million to million 
these increases resulted primarily sales of our algo hearing screening products to both new and existing distributors 
our cost of revenue increased  or  to million in up from million in the neometrics lines of business accounted for million of the increase  which was offset by reductions in manufacturing overhead as a result of cost reduction initiatives undertaken in september gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of revenue improved to in from in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to a reduction in manufacturing overhead as a percent of revenue 
our marketing and selling expenses decreased  or  to million in from million in the decrease in marketing and selling expense was due primarily to a  reduction in personnel costs  in addition to reduced travel and advertising expense of approximately  and other expense reductions 
these cost reductions were partially offset by costs relating to our algo flexicoupler cable transition program  which was substantially completed in  and costs associated with the neometrics business lines 
our research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to a million reduction in personnel costs  as well as reduced travel  outside consultant  contract labor  and prototype expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by costs associated with the neometrics business lines 
our general and administrative expenses were flat at million in and increases in personnel costs of approximately  and costs associated with our neometrics business lines of approximately  were offset by a decrease in outside legal  accounting  and recruiting costs 
we recorded aggregate amortization of  of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenue  and  of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenue 
our net other income expense consists of interest income  interest expense  currency gains and losses  and other items  and decreased  or  to  in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income and a decrease in foreign currency gain 
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to reduced interest rates  and the reduction in currency gains resulted primarily from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound sterling 
segment information management considers the costs associated with restructuring initiatives implemented in september  which are more fully described in note restructuring charges of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report  to be non recurring  and those costs have been excluded from the discussion and analysis of the results of our reportable segments 
additional financial information about our segments  including a 
table of contents reconciliation of segment operating results to consolidated operating results  is set forth in note segment  customer  and geographic information of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
medical devices and related supplies revenue from our medical devices and related supplies segment increased by million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was attributable to sales of algo supplies and the company s neoblue line of phototherapy lights for the treatment of newborn jaundice  which were introduced in october the medical device and related supplies segment reported a loss from operations of million in  including approximately million of depreciation and amortization costs 
the segment reported a loss from operations of million in  including approximately  of depreciation and amortization costs 
the results in improved because of reduced materials costs for both devices and supplies as well as a reduction in all operating expense categories as a percentage of revenue 
software systems our software systems segment consists substantially of the operations of our neometrics business unit  which we acquired in july segment results therefore reflect only the operations of the segment for six months in there are no comparative financial results for revenue from our software systems segment was million in the software systems segment reported a loss from operations of  in  including approximately  of depreciation and amortization costs 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  a decrease of million from december  working capital was million at december  a decrease of million from december  cash provided by operations was million in  compared to cash used in operations of million and million in and respectively 
cash provided by operations in was significantly impacted by a reduction in inventories and an increase in accrued liabilities  offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
in late we temporarily increased the inventory of our hearing screening supply product because our supplier was moving their production facility 
our accounts receivable increased because sales in the fourth quarter of were approximately  more than the comparable period in accrued expenses increased due to a number of factors including severance and employee transition obligations  as well as other accrued compensation 
in june  we implemented an operating cost reduction plan that resulted in an immediate reduction of employees  representing approximately of our then current workforce 
this action contributed significantly to the million income from continuing operations we reported in the second half of we reported approximately million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense in as a result of these factors  we believe that our operations will provide additional cash resources in the future 
our short term investments are primarily available for sale securities with maturities of less than one year  and fluctuations between cash equivalents and short term investments are often attributable to investment decisions 
excluding purchases and sales of short term investments  we used million  million and million of cash in investing activities in  and respectively 
in we acquired fischer zoth for million  and in we acquired neometrics for million  both net of cash acquired 
we believe that we will continue to use our cash resources to acquire additional technologies  products or businesses  and these 
table of contents acquisitions could be significant 
in addition we invested million and million in property and equipment in and  respectively 
the expenditures in were primarily related to an investment to upgrade manufacturing equipment and warehousing facilities 
we had no material capital expenditure commitments as of december  related to our acquisitions of fischer zoth and neometrics are the potential for additional purchase consideration to be paid subject to these business lines achieving certain financial goals 
the company believes the additional purchase consideration will not exceed million  a portion of which is denominated in euro 
if paid  the additional purchase consideration will be paid out over periods through december  cash was provided by financing activities resulted primarily from purchases of our stock by employees pursuant to our stock option and purchase plans  which were million   and  in  and respectively 
our restructuring in june triggered a significant portion of the stock purchases in  as employees who were part of the employee reduction exercised stock options 
payments on borrowings of  in were primarily related to our acquisition of neometrics and are non recurring in nature 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenue  extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  extent to which we make acquisitions  cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  cost and timing of marketing and selling activities  and availability of borrowings under line of credit arrangements and the availability of other means of financing 
in the normal course of business  we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments 
the commitments primarily result from firm  noncancellable purchase orders placed with contract vendors that manufacture some of the components used in our medical devices and related disposable supply products  as well as commitments for leased office  manufacturing  and warehouse facilities 
in addition  we have obligations resulting from the transition agreement and release of our former chief executive officer  and two other former executive officers of the company who left the employ of the company as a result of operating cost reduction plan we implemented in june the impact that our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows total payments due by period less than year years years more than years unconditional purchase obligations operating lease obligations employee transition and termination benefits total the table above does not include obligations under employment agreements for services rendered in the normal course of business 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances  and any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our existing operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
we intend to continue to acquire additional technologies  products or businesses  and these acquisitions could be significant 
the factors will affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our 
table of contents available funds 
we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships  or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the us and sell those products primarily in the us  europe  and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
most of our sales in europe and asia are denominated in us dollars 
prior to our acquisition of our distributor in the uk  our sales in the uk were generally denominated in uk dollars 
since that time  our revenue and expenses in the uk have been denominated in the applicable foreign currency 
with the acquisition of fischer zoth in september  a portion of our sales are now denominated in the euro 
as our sales in currencies other than the us dollar increase  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may increase 
in addition  changes in exchange rates also may affect the end user prices of our products compared to those of our foreign competitors  who may be selling their products based on local currency pricing 
these factors may make our products less competitive in some countries 
if the us dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by relative to the currencies in which our sales were denominated  our net loss would have correspondingly increased or decreased by an immaterial amount for the year ended december  for purposes of this calculation  we have assumed that the exchange rates would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
however  as substantially all of our short term investments carry a fixed rate of interest  a hypothetical decrease of in market interest rates would not result in a material decrease in interest income earned on investments held at december  through the date of maturity on those investments 
the fair value of our available for sale securities is also sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  and the fair value of our portfolio will fall if market interest rates increase 
however  since we generally have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  these declines in fair value may never be realized 
if market interest rates were to increase by from levels at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results may differ as our analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates does not account for  among other things  sales of securities prior to maturity and repurchase of replacement securities  the change in mix or quality of the investments in the portfolio  and changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
our investment policy permits us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in corporate securities including commercial paper  rated a  p or better  and corporate debt instruments  including medium term notes and floating rate notes issued by foreign and domestic corporations  that pay in us dollars and carry a rating of a or better  bank certificates of deposit and banker s acceptances that are rated at least a or p  us treasury bills  notes and bonds and us aaa rated agency securities that carry the direct or implied guarantee of the us government  including notes  discount notes  medium term notes and floating rate notes  asset backed securities rated a or better

we invest our excess cash in short term investments that carry relatively short maturities because our intent is to use our available cash resources to acquire additional technologies  products or businesses  and these acquisitions could be significant 
in july and august  we received million in aggregate net proceeds in connection with our initial public offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  but before deducting offering expenses payable by us 
we are currently investing net offering proceeds from the offering pursuant to our investment policy 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 applying paragraph of fasb statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
 in determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds 
the eitf clarifies the criteria for aggregating an operating segment that does not meet all of the aggregation criteria in paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  but also falls below the quantitative criteria that would dictate that the segment be reported separately 
the consensus reached would enable an entity to aggregate two or more segments that have similar economic characteristics and share a majority of the aggregation criteria in paragraph of sfas no 
the eitf is effective immediately and requires retroactive restatement to previous periods 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have an impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in fasb statement sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  we expect to adopt sfas r on july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirement using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
 and as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
we intend to continue applying apb opinion no 
to equity based compensation awards until the effective date of sfas no 
r 
at the effective date of sfas no 
r  we expect to use the 
table of contents modified prospective application transition method without restatement of prior interim or annual periods in the year of adoption 
this will result in the recognition of compensation cost based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all equity based compensation awards issued after july  for all equity based compensation awards that are unvested as of july   compensation cost will be recognized for the unamortized portion of compensation cost not previously included in the sfas no 
pro forma footnote disclosure 
we are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of sfas no 
r may have on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we expect that the adoption may have a material effect on our results of operations  depending on the level and form of future equity based compensation awards issued  while we expect it will have no impact upon our financial position or cash flows 
risk factors we have a history of losses  variable quarterly results  and seasonality in the sale of our products  and may not maintain profitability in the future since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses including net losses for the years   and  and we may incur net losses in the future 
as of december   we had accumulated deficits of approximately million 
additionally  our revenue and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the following are among the factors that could cause our revenue  operating results  and margins to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter budgeting cycle of our customers  particularly government entities  in the us and internationally  size and timing of specific sales  such as large purchases of our devices and systems or our supplies and services  by government agencies or hospital systems  trade in allowances or other concessions in connection with the introduction of new products or improvements to existing products  length and unpredictability of our sales cycle  particularly for our neometrics products with which we have limited sales experience and which may have sales cycles that are longer or different from the sales cycles of our algo screener products with which we are more familiar  and marked changes caused by rapidly evolving technology for newborn screening products 
as a result  we cannot be certain that we will achieve sustained profitability in the future 
in addition  we experience seasonality in the sale of our products 
for example  our sales typically decline from our fourth fiscal quarter to our first fiscal quarter  due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our current and prospective customers  many of which are government agencies 
we may also experience declining sales in the third fiscal quarter due to summer holiday and vacation schedules 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience these seasonal fluctuations  which may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
many of these factors are beyond our control  and we believe that you should not rely on our results of operations for interim periods as an indication of our expected results in any future period 
we anticipate that our expenses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development to enhance our algo screening  neoblue phototherapy device and other products and technologies  develop additional applications for our current technology  increase our marketing and selling activities  particularly outside the us  continue to increase the size and number of locations of our customer support organization  particularly outside the us  or develop additional infrastructure and hire required management and other employees to keep pace with our growth 

table of contents as a result of these possible increased expenses  we may need to generate significantly higher revenue to achieve profitability 
we cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability in the future or  if we achieve profitability  sustain it 
we have relied  and expect to continue to rely  on sales of our algo screening product family for the majority of our revenue  and a decline in sales of these products could cause our revenue to fall we expect that the revenue from our algo screening product family will continue to account for a majority of our revenue for at least the next two years 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of our algo screening equipment and related disposables or demand for our algo screening products  including physician acceptance or the selection of competing products  could cause our revenue to decline and our business to suffer 
in the united states we sell our products in a mature market that is intensely competitive we face competition from other companies in all of our product lines 
our competitors range from small privately held companies to multinational corporations  and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth 
we do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our screening devices 
in the united states  we sell our supply products in a mature market 
because these products can generate high margins  we expect that our products  particularly our hearing screening supply products  will face increasing competition  including competitors offering lower prices  which could have an adverse affect on our revenue and margins 
we believe that our primary competitive advantage relates to the functionality and reliability of our products 
our competitors may have competitive advantages over us and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
to counter these forces we may need to increase our efforts  and related expenses for research and development  to maintain or improve our position 
we expect recurring sales to our existing customers to generate a majority of our revenue in the future  and if our existing customers do not continue to purchase products from us  our revenue may decline 
our business could be harmed if our competitors establish cooperative relationships with large medical device vendors or rapidly acquire market share through industry consolidation or by bundling together  or with other products  their hearing screening  jaundice treatment  data systems  or newborn metabolic screening products large medical device vendors may acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our current competitors 
we expect that the medical device industry will continue to consolidate 
new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial prospects 
our operating results may decline if we do not succeed in developing  acquiring and marketing additional newborn products or improving our existing products we intend to develop and acquire additional products and technologies for the detection  treatment  monitoring and tracking of common medical conditions in infants and pregnant women 
developing and acquiring new products  and improving our existing products  to meet the needs of neonatologists  audiologists  pediatricians and nurses requires significant investments in research and development 
if we fail to successfully sell new products and update our existing products  our operating results may decline as our existing products reach the end of their commercial life cycles 

table of contents we have very limited experience selling and marketing products other than our algo hearing screening products  and our failure to develop and manage our sales force or to effectively market and sell our neometrics products and services  our neoblue phototherapy device  or our other products will hurt our revenue and quarterly results our sales force has limited experience selling our neometrics data management and metabolic function diagnostic products and services and our neoblue phototherapy device and related products  and we cannot predict how successful our sales force will be in selling them  and other products we may develop or acquire  in the future 
in order to successfully introduce and penetrate the market for these and other products  we must successfully sell them to hospital administrators and government agency purchasing managers who may not be familiar with our algo hearing screeners and who may make purchasing decisions on factors that are different from those that our sales people are accustomed to 
we market almost all of our newborn hearing screening products in the us through a direct sales force 
there are significant risks involved in building and managing our sales force to effectively sell our increasingly diverse lines of products and services 
we may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales people with the skills and training to sell our product line effectively 
if we fail in our efforts to educate physicians  government agency personnel  and third party payors on the effectiveness of our products we will not achieve future sales growth it is critical to the success of our sales efforts that we educate a sufficient number of clinicians  hospital administrators  and government agencies about our products and the costs and benefits of their use 
the commercial success of our products depends upon physician  government agency  and other third party payor confidence in the economic and clinical benefits of our products as well as their comfort with the efficacy  reliability  sensitivity  and specificity of our products 
we believe that physicians will not use our products unless they determine  based on published peer reviewed journal articles  long term clinical data  and experience  that our products provide an accurate and cost effective alternative to other means of testing or treatment 
for instance  there are currently alternative neonatal hearing screening products  which may be less expensive or may be quicker on a per test basis than our algo devices 
with respect to our neoblue phototherapy device  initial data from clinical research suggests that the device may be more effective in treating hyperbilirubinemia than other currently marketed phototherapy products 
we cannot be certain that clinical studies will produce results that are favorable to our neoblue product 
physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products  testing practices  and clinical treatments  partly because of perceived liability risks and the uncertainty of third party reimbursement 
if more clinicians  government agencies  and hospital administrators do not adopt our products  we may never have significant revenue or achieve and maintain profitability 
factors that may affect the medical community s acceptance of our products  some of which are beyond our control  include publication of clinical study results that demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our algo and neoblue products  changing governmental and physician group guidelines for screening of newborns  particularly with respect to full term babies  performance  quality  price  and total cost of ownership of our neonatal screening and jaundice management products relative to other such products  our ability to maintain and enhance our existing relationships and to form new relationships with leading physicians  physician organizations  hospitals  state laboratory personnel  and third party payors  changes in state and third party payor reimbursement policies for newborn screening equipment and procedures  and adoption of state and foreign laws requiring universal newborn screening 

table of contents our plan to expand our international operations will result in increased costs and is subject to numerous risks  if our efforts are not successful  this could harm our business the domestic market for our algo screening products is mature and we plan to expand our international sales and marketing efforts to increase sales of our products in foreign countries 
we must expand the number of distributors who sell our products  or increase our direct international presence  to significantly penetrate international markets 
we have only begun over the past three years to significantly develop our distributor and direct sales force outside the us we currently maintain a direct sales force only in the uk  and increasing our direct sales presence in the uk or elsewhere will require us to incur higher personnel and operating costs that may not result in additional revenues 
a higher percentage of our sales to international distributors could also impair our revenues due to discount prices that we customarily make available to distributors 
we may not realize corresponding growth in revenue from growth in international sales  due to the higher costs of sales outside of the us even if we are able to successfully expand our international selling efforts  we cannot be certain that we will be able to create or increase demand for our products outside of the us our international operations are subject to other risks  which include impact of possible recessions in economies outside the us  political and economic instability  including instability related to war and terrorist attacks in the us and abroad  contractual provisions governed by foreign law  such as local law rights to sales commissions by terminated distributors  dependence of demand for our products on health care spending by foreign governments  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  difficulties of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and potentially conflicting intellectual property rights of third parties under the laws of various foreign jurisdictions  difficulty in obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approval  and attitudes by clinicians  and cost reimbursement policies  towards use of disposable supplies that are potentially unfavorable to our business 
if guidelines requiring universal newborn screening do not continue to develop in foreign countries and governments do not require testing of all newborns as we anticipate  or if those guidelines have a long phase in period  our revenues may not grow we estimate that approximately to of the children born in the us are currently being tested for hearing prior to discharge from the hospital 
to date  there has been only limited adoption of newborn hearing screening prior to hospital discharge by foreign governments  and the phase in period varies from several months to several years 
even fewer foreign countries have adopted rules mandating universal metabolic screening prior to hospital discharge 
the widespread adoption of these guidelines depends  in part  on our ability to educate foreign government agencies  neonatologists  pediatricians  third party payors  and hospital administrators about the benefits of universal newborn screening as well as the use of our products to perform the screening and monitoring 
our revenues may not grow if governments do not require universal newborn screening prior to hospital discharge  or if physicians or hospitals are slow to comply with those guidelines  or if the government provides for a lengthy phase in period for compliance 
because we rely on distributors or sub distributors to sell our products in some markets outside of the us and the us  our revenues could decline if our existing distributors reduce the volume of purchases from us  or if our relationship with any of these distributors is terminated we currently rely on our distributors or sub distributors for a majority of our sales outside the us our reliance on international distributors has increased with our decision in to close our japanese sales 
table of contents subsidiary and sell through a distributor in japan  and our acquisition of fischer zoth  which sells its products through distributors in europe and asia 
some distributors also assist us with regulatory approvals and education of physicians and government agencies 
we intend to continue our efforts to increase our sales in europe  japan and other developed countries 
if we fail to sell our products through our international distributors  we would experience a decline in revenues unless we begin to sell our products directly in those markets 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new international distributors to market our products effectively or provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
even if we are successful in selling our products through new distributors  the rate of growth of our revenue could be harmed if our existing distributors do not continue to sell a large dollar volume of our products 
none of our existing distributors are obligated to continue selling our products 
if we terminate our relationships with distributors for poor performance  as we have done in the past  we may be subject to foreign laws governing our relationships with our distributors 
these laws may require us to make payments to our distributors even if we terminate our relationship for cause 
some countries require termination payments under local law or legislation that may supercede our contractual relationship with the distributor 
these payments could be equal to a year or more of gross margin on sales of our products that the distributor would have earned 
any required payments would adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results may suffer because of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or strengthening of the us dollar relative to local currencies substantially all of our sales contracts to our us based customers provide for payment in us dollars 
in addition  sales to most of our international distributors provide for payment in us dollars 
however  our revenue and expenses of our uk and german subsidiaries are denominated in the applicable foreign currency 
to date we have not undertaken any foreign currency hedging transactions and  as a result  our future revenue and expenses may be unpredictable due to exchange rate fluctuations that could result in foreign exchange gains and losses associated with the translation of assets denominated in foreign currencies 
furthermore  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets where our sales contracts call for payment in us dollars 
if health care providers are not adequately reimbursed for procedures conducted with our devices or supplies  or if reimbursement policies change adversely  we may not be successful marketing and selling new products or technologies physicians  hospitals  and government agencies are unlikely to purchase our products if clinicians are not adequately reimbursed for the procedures conducted with our devices or supplies 
unless a sufficient amount of positive  peer reviewed clinical data about our products has been published  third party payors  including insurance companies and government agencies  may refuse to provide reimbursement 
furthermore  even if reimbursement is provided  it may not be adequate to fully compensate the clinicians or hospitals 
some third party payors may refuse adequate reimbursement unless the infant has demonstrable risk factors 
if health care providers cannot obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for our products or the screenings conducted with our products  it is unlikely that our products will ever achieve significant market acceptance 
acceptance of our products in international markets will depend upon the availability of adequate reimbursement or funding within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement  funding and health care payment systems vary significantly by country 
although we intend to seek reimbursement or funding approvals in international markets  we may not obtain these approvals in a timely manner or at all 
even if third party payors provide adequate reimbursement for procedures conducted with our products  adverse changes in reimbursement policies in general could harm our business 
we are unable to predict changes in the reimbursement methods used by third party health care payors  particularly those in countries and regions outside the us for example  some payors are moving toward a managed care system in which providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
we cannot assure you that in a 
table of contents managed care system the cost of our products will be incorporated into the overall payment for childbirth and newborn care or that there will be adequate reimbursement for our products separate from reimbursement for the procedure 
unless the cost of screening or treatment is reimbursed as a standard component of newborn care  universal screening is unlikely to occur and the number of infants likely to be screened with our products will be substantially reduced 
if we lose our relationship with any supplier of key product components or our relationship with a supplier deteriorates or key components are not available in sufficient quantities  our manufacturing could be delayed and our business could suffer we contract with third parties for the supply of some of the components used in our products and the production of our disposable products 
some of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to supply us 
for certain of these materials and components  relatively few alternative sources of supply exist 
in addition  the lead time involved in the manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy and unpredictable 
during  we experienced delays on the part of a supplier to provide us with volume production of our new flexicoupler supplies 
if these suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply us with components meeting our requirements  it might be difficult to establish additional or replacement suppliers in a timely manner  or at all 
this would cause our product sales to be disrupted and our revenue and operating results to suffer 
replacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable due to regulatory requirements and other factors applicable to our manufacturing operations 
incorporation of components from a new supplier into our products may require a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities and clearance or approval of the filing before we could resume product sales 
this process may take a substantial period of time  and we cannot be assured that we would be able to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance or approval 
this could create supply disruptions that would harm our product sales and operating results 
our sales efforts through group purchasing organizations and sales to high volume purchasers may reduce our average selling prices  which would reduce our revenue and gross profits from these sales we have entered  and may in the future enter  into agreements with customers who purchase high volumes of our products 
our agreements with these customers may contain discounts off of our normal selling prices and other special pricing considerations  which could cause our revenue and profit margins to decline 
in addition  we have entered into agreements to sell our products to members of group purchasing organizations  which negotiate volume purchase prices for medical devices and supplies for member hospitals  group practices and other clinics 
while we make sales directly to group purchasing organization members  the members of these group purchasing organizations now receive volume discounts off our normal selling price and may receive other special pricing considerations from us from time to time 
sales to members of one group purchasing organization  novation  llc  accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue in the twelve months ended december   and respectively 
sales to members of group purchasing organizations accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue the twelve months ended december    and respectively 
other of our existing customers may be members of group purchasing organizations with which we do not have agreements 
our sales efforts through group purchasing organizations may conflict with our direct sales efforts to our existing customers 
if we enter into agreements with new group purchasing organizations and some of our existing customers begin purchasing our products through those group purchasing organizations  our revenue and profit margins could decline 
if material weaknesses in the adequacy of the company s internal controls over financial reporting are identified and reported as a result of the assessment required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of the company s financial statements as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over 
table of contents financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
the company was not subject to these requirements for the fiscal year ended december  the company is currently performing an implementation project in preparation for its first section reporting requirement that will be effective for the year ending december  this report must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  the independent registered public accounting firm auditing the company s financial statements must also attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting as well as the operating effectiveness of the company s internal controls 
while the company is expending significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by section  there is a risk that the company will not comply with all of the requirements imposed by section if the company fails to have an effectively designed and operating system of internal control  it will be unable to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner 
if the company does not effectively complete its assessment or if its internal controls are not designed or operating effectively  its independent registered public accounting firm may either disclaim an opinion as it relates to management s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control or may issue a qualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal controls 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company s financial statements 
our failure to obtain necessary fda clearances or approvals or to comply with fda regulations could hurt our ability to commercially distribute and market our products in the us  and this would harm our business and financial condition unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the us must first receive one of the following types of fda premarket review authorizations k clearance via section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetics act of  as amended  or premarket approval via section of the food  drug  and cosmetics act if the fda has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but can take longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
premarket approval generally takes from one to three years  but can take even longer 
we cannot assure you that the fda will ever grant either k clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market 
furthermore  if the fda concludes that future products using our technology do not meet the requirements to obtain k clearance  we would have to seek premarket approval 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not impose the more burdensome premarket approval requirement on modifications to our existing products or future products  which in either case could be costly and cause us to divert our attention and resources from the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products 
our business may suffer if we are required to revise our labeling or promotional materials or the fda takes an enforcement action against us for off label uses we may not promote or advertise the algo screener  minimuffs  neoblue phototherapy device products  or any future cleared or approved devices  for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals or make unsupported promotional claims about the benefits of our products 
if the fda determines that our claims are outside the scope of our clearances or are unsupported it could require us to revise our promotional claims or take enforcement action against us 
if we were subject to such an action by the fda  our sales could be delayed  our revenue could decline  and our reputation among clinicians could be harmed 
our business would be harmed if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations or we do not pass an inspection we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda concerning compliance with pertinent regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with these requirements  the agency can 
table of contents institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines  injunctions and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  issuance of public notices or warnings  imposition of operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of production  refusal of our requests for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawal of k clearance or premarket approvals already granted  or criminal prosecution 
if we fail to obtain and maintain necessary foreign regulatory approvals in order to market and sell our products outside of the us  we may not be able to sell our products in other countries our products that are regulated domestically by the fda are also regulated outside the us by foreign governmental agencies similar to the fda and are subject to regulatory requirements similar to the fda s 
the time and cost required to obtain market authorization from other countries and the requirements for licensing a product in another country may differ significantly from the fda requirements 
we may not be able to obtain these approvals without incurring significant expenses or at all  and we may not be able to maintain these approvals once they have been obtained 
if we  or our suppliers  fail to comply with applicable regulations  sales of our products could be delayed and our revenue could be harmed every manufacturer of a finished medical device  including natus and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers  is required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulation and comparable regulations of states and other countries 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through periodic inspections 
although we have passed inspections in the past  we cannot assure you that we  or our contract manufacturers  will pass any future quality system regulation inspections 
if we  or our contract manufacturers  fail one of these inspections in the future  our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing and sales delayed significantly until we can demonstrate adequate compliance 
if we or our contract manufacturers fail to take adequate corrective action in a timely fashion in response to a quality system regulations inspection  the fda could shut down our or our contract manufacturers manufacturing operations and require us  among other things  to recall our products  either of which would harm our business 
environmental  health and safety regulation by the government could adversely affect our operations our operations are subject to complex and stringent environmental  health  safety and other governmental laws and regulations 
while we believe that we have obtained the requisite approvals and permits for our existing operations  and that our business is operated in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects  we remain subject to a varied and complex body of laws and regulations 
existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  or new laws and regulations may become applicable to us  that may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we may not be successful in integrating the businesses that we acquire  or the businesses may not perform as projected we acquired intellectual property assets and technology patents from pemstar pacific consultants during  and we acquired the assets of neometrics inc and affiliated entities during and we acquired fischer zoth in we expect to make additional acquisitions of products  technology assets or businesses in 
table of contents the future as part of our efforts to increase revenue and expand our product offerings 
in addition to direct costs  acquisitions pose a number of risks  including inability to effectively integrate acquired products into our business  loss of key personnel of the acquired company  failure to realize expected synergies  failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  failure to maintain customers of  or other relationships existing with respect to the acquired business  failure to successfully develop the acquired technology into the desired products or enhancements  assumption of unknown liabilities  failure to understand and compete effectively in markets and with products or technologies with which we have limited previous experience  and write off of goodwill and intangible assets related to such acquisitions 
while we make efforts to analyze potential acquisitions carefully and to value assets and their related future lives appropriately  we cannot be certain that any completed acquisitions will positively impact our business 
if we fail to achieve the anticipated financial  strategic  and other benefits of acquisitions or investments  our operating results may suffer 
our operating results could suffer if future changes in technology or market conditions result in adjustments to our recorded asset balance for intangible assets we currently have significant intangible assets  including goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
our ability to accurately predict future cash flows related to these intangible assets might be hindered by events that we have no control over 
due to the highly competitive nature of the medical device industry  new technologies could impair the value of our intangible assets if they create market conditions where our products are no longer competitive 
we may not be able to preserve the value of our products intellectual property because we may not be able to protect access to our intellectual property or we may lose our intellectual property rights due to expiration of our licenses or patents if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights do not adequately cover the technology we employ  other medical device companies could sell products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
the company holds approximately us patents and foreign patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  others may attempt to copy or otherwise improperly obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
enforcing our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and may divert our management s attention and resources 
failing to enforce our intellectual property rights could also result in the loss of those rights 
our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim or a significant damage award the medical technology industry has  in the past  been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
we expect that medical 
table of contents screening products may become increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
third parties such as individuals  educational institutions or other medical device companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could have any of the following negative consequences result in costly litigation and damage awards  divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or suspensions  or require us to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a successful claim of infringement against us could result in a substantial damage award and materially harm our financial condition 
our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could prevent us from selling our products and adversely affect our business and financial results 
product liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates the sale and use of our medical testing products could lead to the filing of a product liability claim by someone claiming to have been injured using one of our products or claiming that one of our products failed to perform properly 
a product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend  either of which could materially harm our business or financial condition 
we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance would protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing any coverage in the future 
we depend upon key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and  without additional employees  we cannot grow or achieve and maintain profitability our products and technologies are complex  and we depend substantially on the continued service of our senior management team 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and slow our product development process 
our future success also will depend  in part  on the continued service of our key management personnel  software engineers  and other research and development employees and our ability to identify  hire  and retain additional personnel  including customer service  marketing  and sales staff 
hiring research and development  engineering  sales  marketing and customer service personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of pediatric audiology  neonatal jaundice management  and neonatal metabolic screening 
we may be unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we could lose the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards  which may adversely affect our financial results as of december   we had a total federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards  if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods  will expire in various amounts beginning in through for state and or federal income tax purposes 
if we continue to have net losses  we may not be able to utilize some or all of our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
in addition  us income tax law imposes limitations on the ability of corporations to use net operating loss carryforwards if the corporation experiences a more than change in ownership during any three year period 

table of contents we cannot assure you that we will not take actions  such as the issuance of additional stock  which would cause an ownership change to occur 
accordingly  we may be limited to the amount we can use in any given year  so even if we have substantial net income  we may not be able to use our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
in addition  the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs  and are thus subject to adjustment or disallowance resulting from any such irs examination 
we have not undertaken a study to determine whether such limitations exist  and if so  the extent of such limitations 
however  we believe it is probable that some amounts of our net operating losses will be affected 
if we have taxable income in the future  and we are unable to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  our future tax payments could be higher and our financial results may suffer 
we may become subject to litigation due to the likely volatility of the public market price of our stock our stock price has fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  for a number of reasons including quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations  our ability to successfully commercialize our products  announcements of technological or competitive developments by us or our competitors  announcements regarding patent litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors  announcements regarding state screening mandates or third party payor reimbursement policies  regulatory developments regarding us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  and general market conditions  particularly for companies with a relatively small number of shares available for sale in the public market 
securities class action litigation is often brought against a company after a period of volatility of the market price of its stock 
if our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
stock price fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low 
any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expense and damage awards and divert our management s attention from running our business 
our stockholder rights plan and anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make it more difficult to acquire a large portion of our securities  to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest  or to acquire us  even though such events may be beneficial to our stockholders we maintain a stockholder rights plan that is designed to deter unsolicited takeover activity with respect to our company 
in addition  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may affect the price of our common stock  and could make it more difficult for a third party to remove our management 
further  these provisions may make it more difficult to acquire a large portion of our securities  to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest or acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders
