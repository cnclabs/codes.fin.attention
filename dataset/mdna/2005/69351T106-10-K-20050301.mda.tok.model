item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ppl is an energy and utility holding company with headquarters in allentown  pa 
see item business background  for descriptions of ppl s major segments 
see exhibit in item for a listing of the current corporate organization 
through its subsidiaries  ppl is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets the northeastern and western us and in the delivery of electricity in pennsylvania  the uk and latin america 
ppl s strategy for its electricity generation and marketing business is to match energy supply with load  or customer demand  under long term and intermediate term contracts with creditworthy counterparties 
ppl s strategy for its electricity delivery businesses is to own and operate these businesses at the highest level of quality and reliability and at the most efficient cost 
ppl faces several risks in its generation business 
the principal risks are electricity wholesale price risk  fuel supply and price risk  power plant performance and counterparty credit risk 
ppl attempts to manage these risks through various means 
for instance  ppl operates a portfolio of generation assets that is diversified as to geography  fuel source  cost structure and operating characteristics 
ppl is focused on the operating efficiency of these power plants and maintaining their availability 
in addition  ppl has in place and continues to pursue long term and intermediate term contracts for energy sales and fuel supply  and other means  to mitigate the risks associated with adverse changes in the difference  or margin  between the cost to produce electricity and the price at which ppl sells it 
ppl s contractual commitments for energy sales are primarily satisfied through its own generation assets ie  ppl primarily markets and trades around its physical portfolio of generating assets through integrated generation  marketing and trading functions 
ppl has in place risk management programs that  among other things  are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of earnings and cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  counterparty credit quality and the operational performance of its generating units 
ppl s electricity delivery businesses are rate regulated 
accordingly  these businesses are subject to regulatory risk in terms of the costs that they may recover and the investment returns that they may collect in customer rates 
the principal challenge that ppl faces in its electricity delivery businesses is to maintain high standards of customer service and reliability in a cost effective manner 
ppl faces certain financial risks by conducting international operations  such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
ppl attempts to manage these financial risks through its risk management program 
a key challenge for ppl s business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit profile 
in the past few years  investors  analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry have been particularly focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of energy companies 
ppl is focused on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its liquidity position  thereby improving its credit profile 
the purpose of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is to provide information concerning ppl s past and expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing the risks and challenges outlined above 
specifically results of operations provides an overview of ppl s operating results in  and  starting with a review of earnings 
the earnings review includes a listing of certain unusual items that had significant impacts in these years  and it also includes a description of key factors that management expects may impact future earnings 
results of operations also includes an explanation of changes during this three year period in significant income statement components  such as energy margins  utility revenues  operation and maintenance expenses  financing costs  income taxes and cumulative effects of accounting changes 
financial condition liquidity provides an analysis of ppl s liquidity position and credit profile  including its sources of cash including bank credit facilities and sources of operating cash flow and uses of cash including contractual commitments and capital expenditure requirements and the key risks and uncertainties that impact ppl s past and future liquidity position and financial condition 
this subsection also includes an explanation of recent rating agency decisions affecting ppl  as well as a listing of ppl s current credit ratings 
financial condition risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other includes an explanation of ppl s risk management program relating to market risk ie  commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk ie  counterparty credit risk 
application of critical accounting policies provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of ppl and that require ppl s management to make significant estimates  assumptions and other judgments 
although ppl s management believes that these estimates  assumptions and other judgments are appropriate  they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  changes in the estimates  assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on ppl s results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in ppl s financial statements 
the information provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with ppl s financial statements and the accompanying notes 
terms and abbreviations are explained in the glossary 
dollars are in millions  except per share data  unless otherwise noted 
results of operations the following discussion  which explains significant annual changes in principal items on the statement of income  compares to and compares to wpd s results  as consolidated in ppl s statement of income  are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates

ppl s future earnings could be  or will be  impacted by a number of key factors  including the following ppl s future energy margins and  consequently  its future earnings  may be impacted by fluctuations in market prices for electricity  as well as fluctuations in fuel prices  fuel transportation costs and emission allowance expenses 
for instance  although ppl expects market prices for electricity in to be higher than in  ppl is not expecting an increase in its energy margins due to expected increases in the cost of fuel  fuel transportation and emissions allowances 
a key part of ppl s overall strategy is to enter into long term and intermediate term energy supply agreements in order to mitigate market price and supply risk 
ppl s ability to continue to enter into such agreements  and to renew existing energy supply agreements  may affect its future earnings 
see item business power supply and note to the financial statements for more information regarding ppl s wholesale energy commitments and note for more information regarding the plr contracts 
as discussed in item business background  ppl electric has agreed to provide electricity supply to its plr customers at predetermined rates through  and it has entered into puc approved  full requirements energy supply agreements with ppl energyplus to fulfill its plr obligation 
the predetermined charges for generation supply which ppl electric collects from its plr customers and pays to ppl energyplus under the energy supply agreements provide for annual increases in each year commencing in and continuing through ppl electric s plr obligation after will be determined by the puc pursuant to rules that have not yet been promulgated 
due to current electricity and natural gas price levels  there is a risk that ppl may be unable to recover its investment in certain gas fired generation facilities 
under gaap  ppl does not believe that there is an impairment charge to be recorded for these facilities at this time 
ppl is unable to predict the earnings impact of this issue  based upon future energy and fuel price levels  applicable accounting rules and other factors  but such impact may be material 
in june  a subsidiary of ppl generation agreed to sell the mw sundance power plant to arizona public service company aps 
each party has waived the remaining contractual conditions for approval of the transaction by the arizona corporation commission 
the sale still requires approvals of the ferc under the federal power act 
ppl cannot predict whether or when these approvals will be obtained 
ppl estimates that a loss on sale or an impairment charge of about million after tax  or per share  could be recorded in depending on the timing and likelihood of obtaining the ferc approvals 
ppl s ability to manage operational risk with respect to its generation plants is critical to its financial performance 
specifically  depending on the timing and duration of both planned and unplanned outages in particular  if such outages are during peak periods or periods of severe weather  ppl s revenue from energy sales could be adversely affected and its need to purchase power to satisfy its energy commitments could be significantly increased 
ppl has been successful in the past several years in increasing fleet wide equivalent availability ie  the percentage of time in a year that a generating unit is capable of producing power from the low range to over 
however  since many of its generating units are reaching mid life  ppl is faced with the potential for outages of longer duration to accommodate significant investments in major component replacements 
ppl has interests in two synthetic fuel facilities and receives tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code based on its sale of synthetic fuel to unaffiliated third party purchasers 
ppl has estimated that these facilities will contribute approximately to annual eps through see note to the financial statements for a discussion of the requirements to receive the section tax credits  the irs review of synthetic fuel production procedures and the impact of higher oil prices on the section tax credits 
in march  ppl electric filed a request with the puc for an overall annual net increase in distribution rates of approximately million subsequently amended to million  based on a return on equity of  and notified the puc that it planned to pass through to customers approximately million in increased transmission charges imposed on ppl electric by pjm 
in december  the puc approved an increase in ppl electric s distribution rates of approximately million based on a return on equity of  and approved ppl electric s proposed mechanism for collecting the additional million in transmission related charges  for a total increase of approximately million  effective january  in january  severe ice storms hit ppl electric s service territory 
ppl electric had to restore service to about  customers 
although the actual cost of these storms and the specific allocation of such cost between operation and maintenance expense and capital costs is not yet finalized  ppl electric currently estimates a total cost of million  with approximately being expensed 
on february   ppl electric filed a petition with the puc for authority to defer and amortize for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes its actual cost of these storms  excluding capitalized costs of approximately million and regular payroll expenses of approximately million pursuant to puc precedent on this issue 
if the puc grants this petition  ppl electric s management at that time will assess the recoverability of these costs in ppl electric s next general rate increase proceeding 
based on the puc s action on the petition and management s assessment  ppl electric would either record these storm expenses  excluding regular payroll  as a regulatory asset in accordance with sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  or record these storm expenses on its income statement 
if the puc grants the petition before ppl electric files its form q for the first quarter of  the result of this assessment will be reflected in ppl electric s financial statements for the first quarter of if the puc has not acted on or has denied the petition by such date  ppl electric would record these storm expenses on its income statement 
at this time  ppl electric cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
earnings in and beyond are expected to continue to be adversely affected by increased pension costs 
specifically  wpd will experience increased pension costs due to a recent actuarial valuation of wpd s plans that reflects higher pension obligations 
the increase in pension costs in is forecasted to be approximately million after tax  and the increase in pension costs is expected to continue to be significant in see other operation and maintenance for the impact on earnings in ppl is unable to predict whether future impairments of goodwill may be required for its domestic and international investments 
while no goodwill impairments were required based on the annual review performed in the fourth quarter of  future impairments may occur due to determinations of carrying value exceeding the fair value of these investments 
see note to the financial statements for potential commitments and contingent liabilities that may impact future earnings 
see application of critical accounting policies for an overview of accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of ppl and that require ppl s management to make significant estimates  assumptions and other judgments 
although ppl s management believes that these estimates  assumptions and other judgments are appropriate  they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
see note to the financial statements for new accounting standards that have been issued but not yet adopted by ppl that may impact future earnings

in pjm  where the majority of ppl s eastern wholesale activity occurs  average spot prices rose in over ppl also benefited from favorable transmission congestion positions 
in addition  retail energy prices increased by approximately in in accordance with the schedule established by the puc final order 
the higher volumes reflect the return of customers who had previously shopped for electricity  as well as new load obligations in connecticut and new jersey  partially offset by lower wholesale sales 
partially offsetting these improvements were increased supply costs driven by increased fossil fuel and purchased power prices 
eastern us non trading margins were essentially flat in compared to due to lower supply costs in caused by the buyout of a nug contract in february  which reduced s power purchases by million 
excluding the nug buyout  margins in were higher compared to  primarily due to higher wholesale volumes  which increased by 
the higher volumes were primarily driven by market opportunities to optimize the value of generating assets and by higher spot prices that allowed ppl energy supply to increase the utilization of its higher cost generating units 
northwestern us northwestern us non trading margins were slightly lower in compared to  due in part to a retroactive coal price adjustment caused by an unfavorable arbitration ruling

ppl energyplus also enters into contracts under which it agrees to sell and purchase electricity  natural gas  oil and coal

fitch stated that its downgrade was prompted by the high level of pension adjusted leverage at wpd 
fitch acknowledged that wpd s funding plan should reduce its pension deficit over time and it expects wpd to proceed with its de leveraging program 
however  fitch indicated that it is not certain enough  due to the unpredictability in future pension valuations  that pension adjusted leverage will support a bbb rating at wpdh limited 
fitch indicated that wpd south west and wpd south wales have been downgraded to maintain a two notch differential with wpdh limited because fitch does not believe that wpd s financial ring fencing is restrictive enough to support a three notch differential 
dividend policy in december  ppl s board of directors adopted a dividend policy that provides for growing the common stock dividend in the future at a rate that exceeds the projected rate of growth in earnings per share from ongoing operations

risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other market risk background market risk is the potential loss ppl may incur as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument 
ppl is exposed to market risk from commodity price risk for energy and energy related products associated with the sale of electricity  the purchase of fuel for the generating assets and energy trading activities  interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt and the fair value of fixed rate debt used to finance operations  as well as the fair value of debt securities invested in by ppl s nuclear decommissioning fund  foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with investments in affiliates in latin america and europe  as well as purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars  and equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of equity securities invested in by ppl s nuclear decommissioning fund 
ppl has a risk management policy approved by its board of directors to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk 
credit risk is discussed below 
the rmc  comprised of senior management and chaired by the vice president risk management  oversees the risk management function 
key risk control activities designed to monitor compliance with risk policies and detailed programs include  but are not limited to  credit review and approval  validation of transactions and market prices  verification of risk and transaction limits  sensitivity analyses  and daily portfolio reporting  including open positions  mark to market valuations and other risk measurement metrics 
the forward looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future  assuming certain adverse market conditions  due to reliance on model assumptions 
actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
contract valuation ppl utilizes forward contracts  futures contracts  options  swaps and tolling agreements as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency volatility 
when available  quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a commodity or financial instrument 
this may include exchange prices  the average mid point bid ask spreads obtained from brokers  or an independent valuation by an external source  such as a bank 
however  market prices for energy or energy related contracts may not be readily determinable because of market illiquidity 
if no active trading market exists  contracts are valued using internally developed models  which are then reviewed by an independent  internal group 
although ppl believes that its valuation methods are reasonable  changes in the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different values and realization in future periods 
to record derivatives at their fair value  ppl discounts the forward values using libor 
additionally  ppl reduces derivative assets carrying values to recognize differences in counterparty credit quality and potential illiquidity in the market the credit adjustment takes into account the probability of default  as calculated by an independent service  for each counterparty that has an out of the money position with ppl 
the liquidity adjustment takes into account the fact that it may not be appropriate to value contracts at the midpoint of the bid ask spread 
ppl might have to accept the bid price if ppl wanted to close an open sales position or ppl might have to accept the ask price if ppl wanted to close an open purchase position 
accounting and reporting to account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk  ppl follows the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  and interpreted by dig issues together  sfas  eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  and eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability unless they meet sfas s criteria for exclusion and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  which amends and clarifies sfas to improve financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to ensure that contracts with comparable characteristics are accounted for similarly  sfas clarified the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative  clarified when a derivative contains a financing component  amended the definition of an underlying and amended certain other existing pronouncements 
additionally  sfas placed additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or normal sale exception 
sfas was effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june   except certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that did not yet exist 
ppl adopted sfas as of july  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on ppl 
ppl adopted the final provisions of eitf during the fourth quarter of as such  ppl now reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in the net energy trading margins line on the statement of income 
non derivative contracts that met the definition of energy trading activities as defined by eitf  accounting for energy trading and risk management activities are reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  unrealized gains and losses are not reflected in the financial statements 
prior periods were reclassified 
no cumulative effect adjustment was required upon adoption 
ppl adopted the final provisions of eitf prospectively as of october  as a result of this adoption  non trading bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points 
a major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing available 
see note to the financial statements for the impact of the adoption of eitf ppl s short term derivative contracts are recorded as price risk management assets and price risk management liabilities on the balance sheet 
long term derivative contracts are included in regulatory and other noncurrent assets other and deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities other 
accounting designation energy contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting 
for energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative  the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine their accounting designation 
in addition to energy related transactions  ppl enters into financial interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest expense associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances 
ppl also enters into foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign operations 
as with energy transactions  the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the transaction determine a contract s accounting designation 
these designations are verified by a separate internal group on a daily basis 
see note to the financial statements for a summary of the guidelines that have been provided to the traders who are responsible for contract designation for derivative energy contracts due to the adoption of sfas commodity price risk non trading commodity price risk is one of ppl s most significant risks due to the level of investment that ppl maintains in its generation assets  coupled with the volatility of prices for energy and energy related products 
several factors influence price levels and volatilities 
these factors include  but are not limited to  seasonal changes in demand  weather conditions  available generating assets within regions  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  market liquidity  and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations 
to hedge the impact of market price fluctuations on ppl s energy related assets  liabilities and other contractual arrangements  ppl energyplus sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under ferc market based tariffs throughout the us and enters into financial exchange traded and over the counter contracts 
because ppl owns or controls generating assets  the majority of ppl s energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge accounting 
within ppl s hedge portfolio  the decision to enter into energy contracts hinges on the expected value of ppl s generation 
to address this risk  ppl takes a conservative approach in determining the number of mwhs that are available to be sold forward 
in this regard  ppl reduces the maximum potential output that a plant may produce by three factors planned maintenance  unplanned outages and economic conditions 
the potential output of a plant is first reduced by the amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a particular unit 
another reduction  representing the unplanned outage rate  is the amount of mwhs that historically is not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment breakage 
finally  the potential output of certain plants like peaking units are reduced because their higher cost of production will not allow them to economically run during all hours 
ppl s non trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy contracts 
the net obligation to serve these contracts changes minute by minute 
ppl analyzes historical on peak and off peak usage patterns  as well as spot prices and weather patterns  to determine a monthly level of a block of electricity that best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize earnings volatility 
on a forward basis  ppl reserves a block amount of generation for full requirements energy contracts that is expected to be the best match with their anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks 
anticipated usage patterns and peaks are affected by expected load growth  regional economic drivers and seasonality

the fair value of electricity positions recorded above use the midpoint of the bid ask spreads obtained through otc brokers 
on average  otc quotes for forwards and swaps of natural gas and power extend one and two years into the future 
the prices based on models and other valuation methods category includes the value of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as a result of the long dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the market point  or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or otc broker 
additionally  this category includes strip transactions whose prices are obtained from external sources and then modeled to monthly prices as appropriate 
because of ppl s efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its generation assets  ppl sells electricity and buys fuel on a forward basis  resulting in open contractual positions 
if ppl were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept delivery of fuel under its agreements  under certain circumstances it could be required to pay damages 
these damages would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract price of the commodity 
depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets  such damages could be significant 
extreme weather conditions  unplanned power plant outages  transmission disruptions  non performance by counterparties or their counterparties with which it has energy contracts and other factors could affect ppl s ability to meet its obligations  or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement energy 
although ppl attempts to mitigate these risks  there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations  that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform  or that it will not experience counterparty non performance in the future 
as of december   ppl estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its non trading portfolio by approximately million  compared to a decrease of million at december nbsp  however  the change in the value of the non trading portfolio would have been substantially offset by an increase in the value of the underlying commodity  the electricity generated  because these contracts serve to reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of electricity 
additionally  the value of ppl s unsold generation would be improved 
because ppl s electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position  the adverse movement in prices is usually an increase in prices 
conversely  because ppl s commodity fuels portfolio is generally in a net purchase position  the adverse movement in prices is usually a decrease in prices 
if both of these scenarios happened  the implied margins for the unsold generation would increase 
in accordance with its marketing strategy  ppl does not completely hedge its generation output or fuel requirements 
ppl estimates that for its entire portfolio  including all generation and physical and financial energy positions  a adverse change in power prices across all geographic zones and time periods will decrease expected gross margins by about million 
similarly  a adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices will decrease gross margins by million 
ppl also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market opportunities 
as a result  ppl may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated 
the margins from these trading activities are shown in the statement of income as net energy trading margins

as of december   ppl estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by million  compared to a decrease of million at december  interest rate risk ppl and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations 
ppl utilizes various financial derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt portfolio  adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in us treasury rates and interest rate spreads over treasuries in anticipation of future financing  when appropriate 
risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of ppl s debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   ppl s potential annual exposure to increased interest expense  based on a increase in interest rates  was estimated at million  compared to a million exposure at december  ppl is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and international debt portfolios 
at december   ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million  compared to million at december  ppl utilizes various risk management instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse interest rate movements for future anticipated financing 
while ppl is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments  they are designed such that any economic loss in value should generally be offset by interest rate savings at the time the future anticipated financing is completed 
at december   ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million  compared to a million exposure at december ppl also utilizes various risk management instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt portfolio 
while ppl is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments  any change in market value is recorded with an equal and offsetting change in the value of the debt being hedged 
at december   ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million  compared to a million exposure at december  foreign currency risk ppl is exposed to foreign currency risk  primarily through investments in affiliates in latin america and europe 
in addition  ppl may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars 
ppl has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures  including firm commitments  recognized assets or liabilities and net investments 
in addition  ppl enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk 
ppl executed net forward sale transactions for pound  million to hedge a portion of its net investment in wpdh limited 
the estimated value of these agreements as of december   was million  being the amount ppl would pay to terminate the transactions 
wpdh limited held a net position in cross currency swaps totaling billion to hedge the interest payments and value of its us dollar denominated bonds 
the estimated value of this position at december   being the amount ppl would pay to terminate it  including accrued interest  was million 
on the statement of income  gains and losses associated with hedges of interest payments denominated in foreign currencies are reflected in interest expense 
gains and losses associated with the purchase of equipment are reflected in depreciation 
gains and losses associated with net investment hedges remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet until the investment is disposed 
nuclear decommissioning fund securities price risk in connection with certain nrc requirements  ppl susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the susquehanna station 
as of december nbsp   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed rate  fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on ppl s balance sheet 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund susquehanna s decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs 
however  the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets  and the values of fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ppl susquehanna actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement 
at december nbsp   a hypothetical increase in interest rates and a decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets  as compared to a million reduction at december nbsp  see note to the financial statements for more information regarding the nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that ppl would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
ppl maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparties including requirements that counterparties maintain certain credit ratings criteria and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk 
however  ppl has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities  natural gas distribution companies and other energy marketing and trading companies 
these concentrations of counterparties may impact ppl s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic  regulatory or other conditions 
as discussed above in contract valuation  ppl records certain non performance reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are out of the money from the counterparty s standpoint will default in its performance  in which case ppl would have to sell into a lower priced market or purchase from a higher priced market 
these reserves are reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in price risk management assets on the balance sheet 
ppl also records reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries ppl has made but not yet billed 
these reserves are reflected in unbilled revenues on the balance sheet 
ppl has also established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the california iso for which ppl has not yet been paid  as well as a reserve related to ppl s exposure as a result of the enron bankruptcy  which are reflected in accounts receivable on the balance sheet

pension and other postretirement benefits ppl follows the guidance of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance  but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long term returns on those asset classes 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs ppl records currently 
rate of compensation increase management projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
health care cost trend rate management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 
in selecting discount rates  ppl considers fixed income security yield rates 
at december   ppl decreased the discount rate for its domestic plans from to as a result of decreased domestic fixed income security returns 
the discount rate remained at at december   for ppl s international pension plans 
in selecting an expected return on plan assets  ppl considers tax implications  past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans 
at december   ppl s expected return on plan assets remained at for its domestic pension plans and increased to from for its other postretirement benefit plans 
for its international plans  ppl maintained as the expected return on plan assets at december  in selecting a rate of compensation increase  ppl considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   ppl s rate of compensation increase remained at for its domestic plans 
for its international plans  ppl s rate of compensation increase remained at at december  in selecting health care cost trend rates  ppl considers past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
at december nbsp   ppl s health care cost trend rates were for  gradually declining to for a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on projected benefit obligations  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and other comprehensive income oci 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities in the financial statements associated with a change in certain assumptions 
while the chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption  the inverse of this change would impact the projected benefit obligation  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and oci by a similar amount in the opposite direction

ppl s total net pension and other postretirement benefit obligation as of december   was million 
ppl recognized an aggregate net accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liability of million on its balance sheet as of december  the total obligation is not fully reflected in the current financial statements due to the delayed recognition criteria of the accounting standards for these obligations 
in  ppl recognized net periodic pension and other postretirement costs charged to operating expenses of million 
this amount represents a million increase from this increase in expense was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate at december   offset by decreased postretirement medical costs resulting from increased employee cost sharing 
as a result of the decrease in the assumed discount rate at december  for its domestic pension plans and the increase in the obligations for its international plans determined by their valuation  ppl was required to increase its recognized additional minimum pension liability 
recording the change in the additional minimum liability resulted in a million increase to the pension related charge to oci  net of taxes  translation adjustment and unrecognized prior service costs  with no effect on net income 
this charge increased the pension related balance in oci  which is a reduction to shareowners equity  to million at december  the charges to oci will reverse in future periods if the fair value of trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation

asset impairment ppl performs impairment analyses for long lived assets  including intangibles  that are subject to depreciation or amortization in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
ppl tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long lived asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances are a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for a long lived asset  an impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the asset is impaired  an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset s carrying value to its estimated fair value 
in determining asset impairments  management must make significant judgments to estimate future cash flows  the useful lives of long lived assets  the fair value of the assets and management s intent to use the assets 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the impairment reviews could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
for determining fair value  the fasb has indicated that quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value 
however  when market prices are unavailable  other valuation techniques may be used 
ppl has generally used a present value technique ie  discounted cash flow 
discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of the cash flow streams 
ppl has determined that when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset are being considered  it uses estimated cash flows from the most likely approach to assess impairment whenever one scenario is clearly the most likely outcome 
if no scenario is clearly most likely  then a probability weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash flows from the alternative scenarios 
for assets tested for impairment as of the balance sheet date  the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date  including the assessment of the likelihood of the future sale of the assets 
that assessment made as of the balance sheet date is not revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date 
during  ppl and its subsidiaries evaluated certain gas fired generation assets for impairment  as events and circumstances indicated that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
ppl did not record an impairment of these gas fired generation assets in for these impairment analyses  the most significant assumption was the estimate of future cash flows 
ppl estimates future cash flows using information from its corporate business plan adjusted for any recent sales or purchase commitments 
key factors that impact cash flows include projected prices for electricity and gas as well as firm sales and purchase commitments 
a decrease in estimated future cash flows for certain gas fired generation assets would have resulted in an impairment charge 
in june  a subsidiary of ppl generation agreed to sell the mw sundance power plant to arizona public service company  subject to the receipt of various state and federal regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions 
at december   as a result of the significant regulatory approvals still needed to complete the sale  ppl management did not believe that it was more likely than not that the sale would be consummated and concluded that no impairment charge was required at that time 
see note to the financial statements for additional information on the potential sale of sundance 
ppl performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
ppl performs an annual impairment test for goodwill  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
ppl has determined its reporting units to be one level below its operating segments 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination 
that is  the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
ppl completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of this test did not require any second step assessments and did not result in any impairments 
ppl s most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values 
ppl estimated fair values primarily based upon discounted cash flows 
although a full two step evaluation was not completed  a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of or an increase of the discount rates by basis points would have resulted in the carrying value of certain reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values  indicating a potential impairment of goodwill 
leasing ppl applies the provisions of sfas  accounting for leases  to all leasing transactions 
in addition  ppl applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb and the eitf that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for various leasing arrangements 
in general  there are two types of leases from a lessee s perspective operating leases leases accounted for off balance sheet  and capital leases leases capitalized on the balance sheet 
in accounting for leases  management makes various assumptions  including the discount rate  the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated useful life  in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or capital 
changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease  thus significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition to uncertainty inherent in management s assumptions  leasing transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when they involve real estate and or related integral equipment  sale leaseback accounting leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased assets  synthetic leases leases that qualify for operating lease treatment for book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes  and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets 
at december   ppl continued to participate in a significant sale leaseback transaction 
in july  ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to ppl montana under four year operating leases 
this transaction is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with current rules related to sale leaseback arrangements 
if for any reason this transaction did not meet the requirements for off balance sheet operating lease treatment as a sale leaseback  ppl would have recorded approximately million of additional assets and approximately million of additional liabilities on its balance sheet at december   and would have recorded additional expenses currently estimated at million  after tax  in see note to the financial statements for additional information related to operating leases 
loss accruals ppl periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and ppl s accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas  accounting for contingencies 
sfas defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
fasb defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur 
sfas does not permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains 
ppl continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation  litigation claims  income taxes  regulatory penalties and other events 
ppl also has accrued estimated losses on long term purchase commitments when significant events have occurred 
for example  estimated losses were accrued when long term purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements and when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
under regulatory accounting  ppl electric recorded the above market cost of energy purchases from nugs as part of its purchased power costs on an as incurred basis  since these costs were recovered in regulated rates 
when the generation business was deregulated  the estimated loss associated with these long term purchase commitments to make above market nug purchases was recorded because ppl electric was committed to purchase electricity at above market prices but it could no longer recover these costs in regulated rates 
the accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include the initial identification and recording of the loss  the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual  and the on going assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient 
all three aspects of accounting for loss accruals the initial identification and recording of a probable loss  the identification of triggering events to reduce the loss accrual  and the ongoing assessment of the sufficiency of a recorded loss accrual require significant judgment by ppl s management 
initial identification and recording of the loss accrual ppl uses its internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers  tax specialists and engineers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
ppl has identified certain events which could give rise to a loss  but which do not meet the conditions for accrual under sfas sfas requires disclosure  but not a recording  of potential losses when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred 
the fasb defines reasonably possible as cases in which the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely 
see note to the financial statements for disclosure of potential loss contingencies  most of which have not met the criteria for accrual under sfas reducing recorded loss accruals when an estimated loss is accrued  ppl identifies  where applicable  the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual 
the triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is incurred  or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated 
the following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals certain loss accruals are systematically reduced based on the expiration of contract terms 
an example of this is the loss accrual for above market nug purchase commitments  which is described below 
this loss accrual is being reduced over the lives of the nug purchase contracts 
allowances for excess or obsolete inventory are reduced as the inventory items are pulled from the warehouse shelves and sold as scrap or otherwise disposed 
allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted or when underlying amounts are ultimately collected 
environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and ppl makes actual payments or the loss is no longer considered probable 
on going assessment of recorded loss accruals ppl reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient 
this involves on going communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel  engineers  tax specialists  operation management and other parties 
the largest loss accrual on ppl s balance sheet  and the loss accrual that changed most significantly in  was for an impairment of above market nug purchase commitments 
this loss accrual reflects the estimated difference between the above market contract terms  under the purchase commitments  and the fair value of the electricity to be purchased 
this loss accrual was originally recorded at million in  when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
this loss accrual was transferred to ppl energyplus in the july   corporate realignment 
the above market loss accrual was million at december nbsp  when the loss accrual related to nug purchases was recorded in  ppl electric established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be reduced 
a schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases over the lives of the nug contracts 
all but one of the nug contracts expire by  with the last one ending in ppl energyplus reduces the above market nug liability based on the aforementioned schedule 
as ppl energyplus reduces the liability for the above market nug purchases  it offsets the actual cost of nug purchases  thereby bringing the net power purchase expense more in line with market prices 
ppl energyplus assessed the remaining million above market liability at december   comparing the projected electricity purchases under the pricing terms of the nug contracts with the purchases assuming current projected market prices for the energy 
this assessment was based on projected pjm market prices  including capacity  and a discount factor for the unit contingent nature of each nug s output through the assessment also used a sensitivity around the market prices  adjusting such prices downward by 
ppl management believes that the range in volatility is appropriate due to the significant increase in energy prices over the last few years 
for example  at december   pjm future market prices  including capacity  were higher than the comparable projections at december  the assessment is dependent on the market prices of energy and the estimated output levels of the nugs 
market prices of energy are dependent on many variables  including growth in electricity demand in pjm  available generation  and changes in regulatory and economic conditions 
accordingly  a market price sensitivity was used in the assessment 
based on current projected market prices for energy  the loss accrual for the above market nug purchase commitments would be approximately million 
even if estimated market prices were adjusted downwards by during the remaining term of the nug contracts  the loss accrual for the above market nug purchase commitments would be approximately million 
as noted above  it is very difficult to estimate future electricity prices  which are dependent on many variables and subject to significant volatility 
however  based on this assessment  ppl s management believes that the current recorded nug above market liability of million was sufficient at december  asset retirement obligations sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized as a liability in the financial statements 
the initial obligation should be measured at the estimated fair value 
an equivalent amount should be recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
until the obligation is settled  the liability should be increased  through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement  for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time 
in determining asset retirement obligations  management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value 
fair value is developed through consideration of estimated retirement costs in today s dollars  inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the asset retirement obligation was incurred 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of asset retirement obligations could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
at december   ppl had asset retirement obligations totaling million recorded on the balance sheet 
ppl s most significant assumptions surrounding asset retirement obligations are the forecasted retirement cost  discount rate and inflation rate 
a variance in the forecasted retirement cost  discount rate or inflation rate could have a significant impact on the aro liability 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities related to the aro liability as of december   associated with a change in these assumptions at the time of initial recognition 
there is no significant change to the aro asset value  depreciation expense of the aro asset or accretion expense of the aro liability as a result of changing the assumptions 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption

ppl energy supply  llc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ppl energy supply is an energy company with headquarters in allentown  pa 
see item business background  for a description of ppl energy supply s domestic and international businesses 
see exhibit in item for a listing of its principal subsidiaries 
through its subsidiaries  ppl energy supply is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets the northeastern and western us and in the delivery of electricity in the uk and latin america 
ppl energy supply s strategy for its electricity generation and marketing business is to match energy supply with load  or customer demand  under long term and intermediate term contracts with creditworthy counterparties 
ppl energy supply s strategy for its international electricity delivery businesses is to own and operate these businesses at the highest level of quality and reliability and at the most efficient cost 
ppl energy supply faces several risks in its generation business 
the principal risks are electricity wholesale price risk  fuel supply and price risk  power plant performance and counterparty credit risk 
ppl energy supply attempts to manage these risks through various means 
for instance  ppl energy supply operates a portfolio of generation assets that is diversified as to geography  fuel source  cost structure and operating characteristics 
ppl energy supply is focused on the operating efficiency of these power plants and maintaining their availability 
in addition  ppl energy supply has in place and continues to pursue long term and intermediate term contracts for energy sales and fuel supply  and other means  to mitigate the risks associated with adverse changes in the difference  or margin  between the cost to produce electricity and the price at which ppl energy supply sells it 
ppl energy supply s contractual commitments for energy sales are primarily satisfied through its own generation assets ie  ppl energy supply primarily markets and trades around its physical portfolio of generating assets through integrated generation  marketing and trading functions 
ppl energy supply has in place risk management programs that  among other things  are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of earnings and cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  counterparty credit quality and the operational performance of its generating units 
ppl energy supply s international electricity delivery businesses are rate regulated 
accordingly  these businesses are subject to regulatory risks in terms of the costs that they may recover and the investment returns that they may collect in customer rates 
the principal challenge that ppl energy supply faces in its international electricity delivery businesses is to maintain high standards of customer service and reliability in a cost effective manner 
ppl energy supply faces certain financial risks by conducting international operations  such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
ppl energy supply attempts to manage these financial risks through its risk management program 
a key challenge for ppl energy supply s business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit profile 
in the past few years  investors  analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry have been particularly focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of energy companies 
ppl energy supply is focused on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its liquidity position  thereby improving its credit profile 
the purpose of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is to provide information concerning ppl energy supply s past and expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing the risks and challenges outlined above 
specifically results of operations provides an overview of ppl energy supply s operating results in  and  starting with a review of earnings 
the earnings review includes a listing of certain unusual items that had significant impacts in these years  and it also includes a description of key factors that management expects may impact future earnings 
results of operations also includes an explanation of changes during this three year period in significant income statement components  such as energy margins  utility revenues  operation and maintenance expenses  financing costs  income taxes and cumulative effects of accounting changes 
financial condition liquidity provides an analysis of ppl energy supply s liquidity position and credit profile  including its sources of cash including bank credit facilities and sources of operating cash flow and uses of cash including contractual commitments and capital expenditure requirements and the key risks and uncertainties that impact ppl energy supply s past and future liquidity position and financial condition

financial condition risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other includes an explanation of ppl energy supply s risk management program relating to market risk ie  commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk ie  counterparty credit risk 
application of critical accounting policies provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of ppl energy supply and that require ppl energy supply s management to make significant estimates  assumptions and other judgments 
although ppl energy supply s management believes that these estimates  assumptions and other judgments are appropriate  they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  changes in the estimates  assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on ppl energy supply s results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in ppl energy supply s financial statements 
the information provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with ppl energy supply s financial statements and the accompanying notes

ppl energy supply s future earnings could be  or will be  impacted by a number of key factors  including the following ppl energy supply s future energy margins and  consequently  its future earnings  may be impacted by fluctuations in market prices for electricity  as well as fluctuations in fuel prices  fuel transportation costs and emission allowance expenses 
for instance  although ppl energy supply expects market prices for electricity in to be higher than in  ppl energy supply is not expecting an increase in its energy margins due to expected increases in the cost of fuel  fuel transportation and emissions allowances 
a key part of ppl energy supply s overall strategy is to enter into long term and intermediate term energy supply agreements in order to mitigate market price and supply risk 
ppl energy supply s ability to continue to enter into such agreements  and to renew existing energy supply agreements  may affect its future earnings 
see item business power supply and note to the financial statements for more information regarding ppl energy supply s wholesale energy commitments and note for more information regarding the plr contracts 
as discussed in item business background  ppl electric has agreed to provide electricity supply to its plr customers at predetermined rates through  and it has entered into puc approved  full requirements energy supply agreements with ppl energyplus to fulfill its plr obligation 
the predetermined charges for generation supply which ppl electric collects from its plr customers and pays to ppl energyplus under the energy supply agreements provide for annual increases in each year commencing in and continuing through ppl electric s plr obligation after will be determined by the puc pursuant to rules that have not yet been promulgated 
due to current electricity and natural gas price levels  there is a risk that ppl energy supply may be unable to recover its investment in certain gas fired generation facilities 
under gaap  ppl energy supply does not believe that there is an impairment charge to be recorded for these facilities at this time 
ppl energy supply is unable to predict the earnings impact of this issue  based upon future energy price and fuel levels  applicable accounting rules and other factors  but such impact may be material 
in june  a subsidiary of ppl generation agreed to sell the mw sundance power plant to arizona public service company aps 
each party has waived the remaining contractual conditions for approval of the transaction by the arizona corporation commission 
the sale still requires approvals of the ferc under the federal power act 
ppl energy supply cannot predict whether or when these approvals will be obtained 
ppl energy supply estimates that a loss on sale or an impairment charge of about million after tax  could be recorded in depending on the timing and likelihood of obtaining the ferc approvals 
ppl energy supply s ability to manage operational risk with respect to its generation plants is critical to its financial performance 
specifically  depending on the timing and duration of both planned and unplanned outages in particular  if such outages are during peak periods or periods of severe weather  ppl energy supply s revenue from energy sales could be adversely affected and its need to purchase power to satisfy its energy commitments could be significantly increased 
ppl energy supply has been successful in the past several years in increasing fleet wide equivalent availability ie  the percentage of time in a year that a generating unit is capable of producing power from the low range to over 
however  since many of its generating units are reaching mid life  ppl energy supply is faced with the potential for outages of longer duration to accommodate significant investments in major component replacements 
ppl energy supply has interests in two synthetic fuel facilities and receives tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code based on its sale of synthetic fuel to unaffiliated third party purchasers 
ppl energy supply has estimated that these facilities will contribute approximately million per year to earnings through see note to the financial statements for a discussion of the requirements to receive the section tax credits  the irs review of synthetic fuel production procedures and the impact of higher oil prices on the section tax credits 
earnings in and beyond are expected to continue to be adversely affected by increased pension costs 
specifically  wpd will experience increased pension costs due to a recent actuarial valuation of wpd s plans that reflects higher pension obligations 
the increase in pension costs in is forecasted to be approximately million after tax  and the increase in pension costs is expected to continue to be significant in see other operation and maintenance for the impact on earnings in ppl energy supply is unable to predict whether future impairments of goodwill may be required for its domestic and international investments 
while no goodwill impairments were required based on the annual review performed in the fourth quarter of  future impairments may occur due to determinations of carrying value exceeding the fair value of these investments 
see note to the financial statements for potential commitments and contingent liabilities that may impact future earnings 
see application of critical accounting policies for an overview of accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of ppl energy supply and that require ppl energy supply s management to make significant estimates  assumptions and other judgments

fitch stated that its downgrade was prompted by the high level of pension adjusted leverage at wpd 
fitch acknowledged that wpd s funding plan should reduce its pension deficit over time and it expects wpd to proceed with its de leveraging program 
however  fitch indicated that it is not certain enough  due to the unpredictability in future pension valuations  that pension adjusted leverage will support a bbb rating at wpdh limited 
fitch indicated that wpd south west and wpd south wales have been downgraded to maintain a two notch differential with wpdh limited because it does not believe that the financial ring fencing is restrictive enough to support a three notch differential

risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other market risk background market risk is the potential loss ppl energy supply may incur as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument 
ppl energy supply is exposed to market risk from commodity price risk for energy and energy related products associated with the sale of electricity  the purchase of fuel for the generating assets and energy trading activities  interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt and the fair value of fixed rate debt used to finance operations  as well as the fair value of debt securities invested in by ppl energy supply s nuclear decommissioning fund  foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with investments in affiliates in latin america and europe  as well as purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars  and equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of equity securities invested in by ppl energy supply s nuclear decommissioning fund 
ppl energy supply has a risk management policy approved by ppl s board of directors to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk 
credit risk is discussed below 
the rmc  comprised of senior management and chaired by the vice president risk management  oversees the risk management function 
key risk control activities designed to monitor compliance with risk policies and detailed programs include  but are not limited to  credit review and approval  validation of transactions and market prices  verification of risk and transaction limits  sensitivity analyses  and daily portfolio reporting  including open positions  mark to market valuations and other risk measurement metrics 
the forward looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future  assuming certain adverse market conditions  due to reliance on model assumptions 
actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
contract valuation ppl energy supply utilizes forward contracts  futures contracts  options  swaps and tolling agreements as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency volatility 
when available  quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a commodity or financial instrument 
this may include exchange prices  the average mid point bid ask spreads obtained from brokers  or an independent valuation by an external source  such as a bank 
however  market prices for energy or energy related contracts may not be readily determinable because of market illiquidity 
if no active trading market exists  contracts are valued using internally developed models  which are then reviewed by an independent  internal group 
although ppl energy supply believes that its valuation methods are reasonable  changes in the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different values and realization in future periods 
to record derivatives at their fair value  ppl energy supply discounts the forward values using libor 
additionally  ppl energy supply reduces derivative assets carrying values to recognize differences in counterparty credit quality and potential illiquidity in the market the credit adjustment takes into account the probability of default  as calculated by an independent service  for each counterparty that has an out of the money position with ppl energy supply 
the liquidity adjustment takes into account the fact that it may not be appropriate to value contracts at the midpoint of the bid ask spread 
ppl energy supply might have to accept the bid price if ppl energy supply wanted to close an open sales position or ppl energy supply might have to accept the ask price if ppl energy supply wanted to close an open purchase position 
accounting and reporting to account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk  ppl energy supply follows the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  and interpreted by dig issues together  sfas  eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  and eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability unless they meet sfas s criteria for exclusion and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  which amends and clarifies sfas to improve financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to ensure that contracts with comparable characteristics are accounted for similarly  sfas clarified the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative  clarified when a derivative contains a financing component  amended the definition of an underlying and amended certain other existing pronouncements 
additionally  sfas placed additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or normal sale exception 
sfas was effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june   except certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that did not yet exist 
ppl energy supply adopted sfas as of july  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on ppl energy supply 
ppl energy supply adopted the final provisions of eitf during the fourth quarter of as such  ppl energy supply now reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in the net energy trading margins line on the statement of income 
non derivative contracts that met the definition of energy trading activities as defined by eitf  accounting for energy trading and risk management activities are reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  unrealized gains and losses are not reflected in the financial statements 
prior periods were reclassified 
no cumulative effect adjustment was required upon adoption 
ppl energy supply adopted the final provisions of eitf prospectively as of october  as a result of this adoption  non trading bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points 
a major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing available 
see note to the financial statements for the impact of the adoption of eitf ppl energy supply s short term derivative contracts are recorded as price risk management assets and price risk management liabilities on the balance sheet 
long term derivative contracts are included in other noncurrent assets other and deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities other 
accounting designation energy contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting 
for energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative  the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine their accounting designation 
in addition to energy related transactions  ppl energy supply enters into financial interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest expense associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances 
ppl energy supply also enters into foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign operations 
as with energy transactions  the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the transaction determine the contract s accounting designation 
these designations are verified by a separate internal group on a daily basis 
see note to the financial statements for a summary of the guidelines that have been provided to the traders who are responsible for contract designation for derivative energy contracts due to the adoption of sfas commodity price risk non trading commodity price risk is one of ppl energy supply s most significant risks due to the level of investment that ppl energy supply maintains in its generation assets  coupled with the volatility of prices for energy and energy related products 
several factors influence price levels and volatilities 
these factors include  but are not limited to  seasonal changes in demand  weather conditions  available generating assets within regions  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  market liquidity  and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations 
to hedge the impact of market price fluctuations on ppl energy supply s energy related assets  liabilities and other contractual arrangements  ppl energyplus sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under ferc market based tariffs throughout the us and enters into financial exchange traded and over the counter contracts 
because ppl energy supply owns or controls generating assets  the majority of ppl energy supply s energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge accounting 
within ppl energy supply s hedge portfolio  the decision to enter into energy contracts hinges on the expected value of ppl energy supply s generation 
to address this risk  ppl energy supply takes a conservative approach in determining the number of mwhs that are available to be sold forward 
in this regard  ppl energy supply reduces the maximum potential output that a plant may produce by three factors planned maintenance  unplanned outages and economic conditions 
the potential output of a plant is first reduced by the amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a particular unit 
another reduction  representing the unplanned outage rate  is the amount of mwhs that historically are not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment breakage 
finally  the potential output of certain plants like peaking units are reduced because their higher cost of production will not allow them to economically run during all hours 
ppl energy supply s non trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy contracts 
the net obligation to serve these contracts changes minute by minute 
ppl energy supply analyzes historical on peak and off peak usage patterns  as well as spot prices and weather patterns  to determine a monthly level of a block of electricity that best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize earnings volatility 
on a forward basis  ppl energy supply reserves a block amount of generation for full requirements energy contracts that is expected to be the best match with their anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks 
anticipated usage patterns and peaks are affected by expected load growth  regional economic drivers and seasonality

additionally  this category includes strip transactions whose prices are obtained from external sources and then modeled to monthly prices as appropriate 
because of ppl energy supply s efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its generation assets  ppl energy supply sells electricity and buys fuel on a forward basis  resulting in open contractual positions 
if ppl energy supply were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements  under certain circumstances it could be required to pay damages 
these damages would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract price of the commodity 
depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets  such damages could be significant 
extreme weather conditions  unplanned power plant outages  transmission disruptions  non performance by counterparties or their counterparties with which it has energy contracts and other factors could affect ppl energy supply s ability to meet its obligations  or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement energy 
although ppl energy supply attempts to mitigate these risks  there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations  that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform  or that it will not experience counterparty non performance in the future 
as of december   ppl energy supply estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its non trading portfolio by approximately million  compared to a decrease of million at december  however  the change in the value of the non trading portfolio would have been substantially offset by an increase in the value of the underlying commodity  the electricity generated  because these contracts serve to reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of electricity 
additionally  the value of ppl energy supply s unsold generation would be improved 
because ppl energy supply s electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position  the adverse movement in prices is usually an increase in prices 
conversely  because ppl energy supply s commodity fuels portfolio is generally in a net purchase position  the adverse movement in prices is usually a decrease in prices 
if both of these scenarios happened  the implied margins for the unsold generation would increase 
in accordance with its marketing strategy  ppl energy supply does not completely hedge its generation output or fuel requirements 
ppl energy supply estimates that for its entire portfolio  including all generation and physical and financial energy positions  a adverse change in power prices across all geographic zones and time periods will decrease expected gross margins by about million 
similarly  a adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices will decrease gross margins by million 
ppl energy supply also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market opportunities 
as a result  ppl energy supply may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated 
the margins from these trading activities are shown in the statement of income as net energy trading margins

as of december   ppl energy supply estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by million  compared to a decrease of million at december  interest rate risk ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations 
ppl manages interest rate risk for ppl energy supply by using various financial derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt portfolio  adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in us treasury rates and interest rate spreads over treasuries in anticipation of future financing  when appropriate 
risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of ppl energy supply s debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   ppl energy supply s potential annual exposure to increased interest expense  based on a increase in interest rates  was estimated at million  and was insignificant at december  ppl energy supply is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and international debt portfolio 
at december nbsp   ppl energy supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million  compared to million at december  ppl and ppl energy supply utilize various risk management instruments to reduce ppl energy supply s exposure to adverse interest rate movements for future anticipated financing 
while ppl energy supply is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments  they are designed such that any economic loss in value should generally be offset by interest rate savings at the time the future anticipated financing is completed 
at december   ppl energy supply had none of these instruments outstanding 
at december   ppl energy supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million 
ppl and ppl energy supply also utilize various risk management instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in ppl energy supply s debt portfolio 
while ppl energy supply is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments  any change in market value is recorded with an equal and offsetting change in the value of the debt being hedged 
at december   ppl energy supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million  compared to an exposure of million at december foreign currency risk ppl energy supply is exposed to foreign currency risk  primarily through investments in affiliates in latin america and europe 
in addition  ppl energy supply may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars 
ppl has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures  including firm commitments  recognized assets or liabilities and net investments 
in addition  ppl enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk 
ppl executed net forward sale transactions for pound  million to hedge a portion of its net investment in wpdh limited 
the estimated value of these agreements as of december   was million  being the amount ppl would pay to terminate the transactions 
wpdh limited held a net position in cross currency swaps totaling billion to hedge the interest payments and value of its us dollar denominated bonds 
the estimated value of this position at december   being the amount ppl would pay to terminate it  including accrued interest  was million 
on the statement of income  gains and losses associated with hedges of interest payments denominated in foreign currencies are reflected in interest expense 
gains and losses associated with the purchase of equipment are reflected in depreciation 
gains and losses associated with net investment hedges remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet until the investment is disposed 
nuclear decommissioning fund securities price risk in connection with certain nrc requirements  ppl susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the susquehanna station 
as of december nbsp   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed rate  fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on ppl energy supply s balance sheet 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund susquehanna s decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs 
however  the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets  and the values of fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ppl susquehanna actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement 
at december nbsp   a hypothetical increase in interest rates and a decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets  as compared to a million reduction at december  see note to the financial statements for more information regarding the nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that ppl energy supply would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
ppl energy supply maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparties including requirements that counterparties maintain certain credit ratings criteria and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk 
however  ppl energy supply has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities  natural gas distribution companies and other energy marketing and trading companies 
these concentrations of counterparties may impact ppl energy supply s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic  regulatory or other conditions 
as discussed above in contract valuation  ppl energy supply records certain non performance reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are out of the money from the counterparty s standpoint will default in its performance  in which case ppl energy supply would have to sell into a lower priced market or purchase from a higher priced market 
these reserves are reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in price risk management assets on the balance sheet 
ppl energy supply also records reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries ppl energy supply has made but not yet billed 
these reserves are reflected in unbilled revenues on the balance sheet 
ppl energy supply has also established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the california iso for which ppl energy supply has not yet been paid  as well as a reserve related to ppl energy supply s exposure as a result of the enron bankruptcy  which are reflected in accounts receivable on the balance sheet

pension and other postretirement benefits as described in note to the financial statements  ppl energy supply subsidiaries sponsor various pension and other postretirement plans and participate in  and are allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic pension cost of the ppl retirement plan and the ppl postretirement benefit plan 
ppl and ppl energy supply follow the guidance of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these pension and other postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance  but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long term returns on those asset classes 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs ppl energy supply records currently 
rate of compensation increase management projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
health care cost trend rate management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 
in selecting discount rates  ppl and ppl energy supply consider fixed income security yield rates 
at december   ppl and ppl energy supply decreased the discount rate for their domestic plans from to as a result of decreased domestic fixed income security returns 
the discount rate remained at at december  for ppl energy supply s international pension plans 
in selecting an expected return on plan assets  ppl and ppl energy supply consider tax implications  past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans 
at december   ppl and ppl energy supply s expected return on plan assets for their domestic pension plans remained at 
for its international plans  ppl energy supply maintained as the expected return on plan assets at december  in selecting a rate of compensation increase  ppl and ppl energy supply consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   ppl and ppl energy supply s rates of compensation increase remained at for their domestic plans 
for its international plans  ppl energy supply s rate of compensation increase remained at at december nbsp  in selecting health care cost trend rates  ppl and ppl energy supply consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
at december   ppl and ppl energy supply s health care cost trend rates were for  gradually declining to for a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on projected benefit obligations  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and other comprehensive income oci 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities in the financial statements associated with a change in certain assumptions 
while the chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption  the inverse of this change would impact the projected benefit obligation  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and oci by a similar amount in the opposite direction

the total net pension and other postretirement benefit obligation for ppl energy supply s plans was million as of december  ppl energy supply recognized an aggregate net accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liability of million on its balance sheet as of december   for its plans 
the total obligation is not fully reflected in the current financial statements due to the delayed recognition criteria of the accounting standards for these obligations 
at december   ppl energy supply also reflected a net liability of million on its balance sheet for pension liabilities and prepaid other postretirement benefit costs allocated from plans sponsored by ppl services 
in  ppl energy supply was allocated and recognized net periodic pension and other postretirement income credited to operating expenses of million 
this amount represents a million decrease versus the credit recognized during this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate at december  as a result of the decrease in the assumed discount rate at december   for its domestic pension plans and the increase in the obligations for its international plans determined by their valuations  ppl energy supply was required to increase its recognized additional minimum pension liability 
recording the change in the additional minimum liability resulted in a million increase to the pension related charge to oci  net of taxes  translation adjustment and unrecognized prior service costs  with no effect on net income 
this charge increased the pension related balance in oci  which is a reduction to member s equity  to million at december nbsp  the charges to oci will reverse in future periods if the fair value of trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation

asset impairment ppl energy supply performs impairment analyses for long lived assets  including intangibles  that are subject to depreciation or amortization in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
ppl energy supply tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long lived asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances are a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for a long lived asset  an impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the asset is impaired  an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset s carrying value to its estimated fair value 
in determining asset impairments  management must make significant judgments to estimate future cash flows  the useful lives of long lived assets  the fair value of the assets and management s intent to use the assets 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the impairment reviews could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
for determining fair value  the fasb has indicated that quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value 
however  when market prices are unavailable  other valuation techniques may be used 
ppl energy supply has generally used a present value technique ie  discounted cash flow 
discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of the cash flow streams 
ppl energy supply has determined that when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset are being considered  it uses estimated cash flows from the most likely approach to assess impairment whenever one scenario is clearly the most likely outcome 
if no scenario is clearly most likely  then a probability weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash flows from the alternative scenarios 
for assets tested for impairment as of the balance sheet date  the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date  including the assessment of the likelihood of the future sale of the assets 
that assessment made as of the balance sheet date is not revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date 
during  ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries evaluated certain gas fired generation assets for impairment  as events and circumstances indicated that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
ppl energy supply did not record an impairment of these gas fired generation assets in for these impairment analyses  the most significant assumption was the estimate of future cash flows 
ppl energy supply estimates future cash flows using information from its corporate business plan adjusted for any recent sales or purchase commitments 
key factors that impact cash flows include projected prices for electricity and gas as well as firm sales and purchase commitments 
a decrease in estimated future cash flows for certain gas fired generation assets would have resulted in an impairment charge 
in june  a subsidiary of ppl generation agreed to sell the mw sundance power plant to arizona public service company  subject to the receipt of various state and federal regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions 
at december   as a result of the significant regulatory approvals still needed to complete the sale  ppl management did not believe that it was more likely than not that the sale would be consummated and concluded that no impairment charge was required at that time 
see note to the financial statements for additional information on the potential sale of sundance 
ppl energy supply performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
ppl energy supply performs an annual impairment test for goodwill  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
ppl energy supply has determined its reporting units to be one level below its operating segments 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination 
that is  the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
ppl energy supply completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of this test did not require any second step assessments and did not result in any impairments 
ppl energy supply s most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values 
ppl energy supply estimated fair values primarily based upon discounted cash flows 
although a full two step evaluation was not completed  a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of or an increase of the discount rates by basis points would have resulted in the carrying value of certain reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values  indicating a potential impairment of goodwill 
leasing ppl energy supply applies the provisions of sfas  accounting for leases  to all leasing transactions 
in addition  ppl energy supply applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb and the eitf that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for various leasing arrangements 
in general  there are two types of leases from a lessee s perspective operating leases leases accounted for off balance sheet  and capital leases leases capitalized on the balance sheet 
in accounting for leases  management makes various assumptions  including the discount rate  the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated useful life  in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or capital 
changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease  thus significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition to uncertainty inherent in management s assumptions  leasing transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when they involve real estate and or related integral equipment  sale leaseback accounting leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased assets  synthetic leases leases that qualify for operating lease treatment for book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes  and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets 
at december   ppl energy supply continued to participate in a significant sale leaseback transaction 
in july  ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to ppl montana under four year operating leases 
this transaction is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with current rules related to sale leaseback arrangements 
if for any reason this transaction did not meet the requirements for off balance sheet operating lease treatment as a sale leaseback  ppl energy supply would have recorded approximately million of additional assets and approximately million of additional liabilities on its balance sheet at december   and would have recorded additional expenses currently estimated at million  after tax  in see note to the financial statements for additional information related to operating leases 
loss accruals ppl energy supply periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and ppl energy supply s accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas  accounting for contingencies 
sfas defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
fasb defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur 
sfas does not permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains 
ppl energy supply continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation  litigation claims  income taxes  regulatory penalties and other events 
ppl energy supply also has accrued estimated losses on long term purchase commitments when significant events have occurred 
for example  estimated losses were accrued when long term purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements and when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
under regulatory accounting  ppl electric recorded the above market cost of energy purchases from nugs as part of its purchased power costs on an as incurred basis  since these costs were recovered in regulated rates 
when the generation business was deregulated  the estimated loss associated with these long term purchase commitments to make above market nug purchases was recorded because ppl electric was committed to purchase electricity at above market prices but it could no longer recover these costs in regulated rates 
the accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include the initial identification and recording of the loss  the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual  and the on going assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient 
all three aspects of accounting for loss accruals the initial identification and recording of a probable loss  the identification of triggering events to reduce the loss accrual  and the ongoing assessment of the sufficiency of a recorded loss accrual require significant judgment by ppl energy supply s management 
initial identification and recording of the loss accrual ppl energy supply uses its internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers  tax specialists and engineers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
ppl energy supply has identified certain events which could give rise to a loss  but which do not meet the conditions for accrual under sfas sfas requires disclosure  but not a recording  of potential losses when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred 
the fasb defines reasonably possible as cases in which the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely 
see note to the financial statements for disclosure of potential loss contingencies  most of which have not met the criteria for accrual under sfas reducing recorded loss accruals when an estimated loss is accrued  ppl energy supply identifies  where applicable  the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual 
the triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is incurred  or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated 
the following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals certain loss accruals are systematically reduced based on the expiration of contract terms 
an example of this is the loss accrual for above market nug purchase commitments  which is described below 
this loss accrual is being reduced over the lives of the nug purchase contracts 
allowances for excess or obsolete inventory are reduced as the inventory items are pulled from the warehouse shelves and sold as scrap or otherwise disposed 
allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted or when underlying amounts are ultimately collected 
environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and ppl energy supply makes actual payments or the loss is no longer considered probable 
on going assessment of recorded loss accruals ppl energy supply reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient 
this involves on going communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel  engineers  tax specialists  operation management and other parties 
the largest loss accrual on ppl energy supply s balance sheet  and the loss accrual that changed most significantly in  was for an impairment of above market nug purchase commitments 
this loss accrual reflects the estimated difference between the above market contract terms  under the purchase commitments  and the fair value of the electricity to be purchased 
this loss accrual was originally recorded at million in  when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
this loss accrual was transferred to ppl energyplus in the july   corporate realignment 
the above market loss accrual was million at december nbsp  when the loss accrual related to nug purchases was recorded in  ppl electric established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be reduced 
a schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases over the lives of the nug contracts 
all but one of the nug contracts expire by  with the last one ending in ppl energyplus reduces the above market nug liability based on the aforementioned schedule 
as ppl energyplus reduces the liability for the above market nug purchases  it offsets the actual cost of nug purchases  thereby bringing the net power purchase expense more in line with market prices 
ppl energyplus assessed the remaining million above market liability at december   comparing the projected electricity purchases under the pricing terms of the nug contracts with the purchases assuming current projected market prices for the energy 
this assessment was based on projected pjm market prices  including capacity  and a discount factor for the unit contingent nature of each nug s output through the assessment also used a sensitivity around the market prices  adjusting such prices downward by 
ppl energy supply management believes that the range in volatility is appropriate due to the significant increase in energy prices over the last few years 
for example  at december   pjm future market prices  including capacity  were higher than the comparable projections at december  the assessment is dependent on the market prices of energy and the estimated output levels of the nugs 
market prices of energy are dependent on many variables  including growth in electricity demand in pjm  available generation  and changes in regulatory and economic conditions 
accordingly  a market price sensitivity was used in the assessment 
based on current projected market prices for energy  the loss accrual for the above market nug purchase commitments would be approximately million 
even if estimated market prices were adjusted downwards by during the remaining term of the nug contracts  the loss accrual for the above market nug purchase commitments would be approximately million 
as noted above  it is very difficult to estimate future electricity prices  which are dependent on many variables and subject to significant volatility 
however  based on this assessment  ppl energy supply s management believes that the current recorded nug above market liability of million was sufficient at december  asset retirement obligations sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized as a liability in the financial statements 
the initial obligation should be measured at the estimated fair value 
an equivalent amount should be recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
until the obligation is settled  the liability should be increased  through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement  for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time 
in determining asset retirement obligations  management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value 
fair value is developed through consideration of estimated retirement costs in today s dollars  inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the asset retirement obligation was incurred 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of asset retirement obligations could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
at december   ppl energy supply had asset retirement obligations totaling million recorded on the balance sheet 
ppl s energy supply most significant assumptions surrounding asset retirement obligations are the forecasted retirement cost  discount rate and inflation rate 
a variance in the forecasted retirement cost  discount rate or inflation rate could have a significant impact on the aro liability 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities related to the aro liability as of december   associated with a change in these assumptions at the time of initial recognition 
there is no significant change to the aro asset value  depreciation expense of the aro asset or accretion expense of the aro liability as a result of changing the assumptions 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption

ppl electric utilities corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ppl electric provides electricity delivery service in eastern and central pennsylvania 
its headquarters are in allentown  pa 
see item business background  for a description of ppl electric s business 
ppl electric s strategy and principal challenge is to own and operate its electricity delivery business at the highest level of quality and reliability and at the most efficient cost 
ppl electric s electricity delivery business is rate regulated 
accordingly  ppl electric is subject to regulatory risks in terms of the costs that it may recover and the investment returns that it may collect in customers rates 
an important challenge for ppl electric is to maintain a strong credit profile 
in the past few years  investors  analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry have been particularly focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of these companies 
ppl electric is focused on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its liquidity position  thereby improving its credit profile 
the purpose of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is to provide information concerning ppl electric s past and expected future performance in implementing the strategy and challenges outlined above 
specifically results of operations provides an overview of ppl electric s operating results in  and  starting with a review of earnings 
the earnings review discusses the outcome of the delivery rate increase that ppl electric filed with the puc in results of operations also includes an explanation of changes during this three year period in significant income statement components  such as operating revenues  operation and maintenance expenses  financing costs and income taxes 
financial condition liquidity provides an analysis of ppl electric s liquidity position and credit profile  including its sources of cash including bank credit facilities and sources of operating cash flow and uses of cash including contractual commitments and capital expenditure requirements and the key risks and uncertainties that impact ppl electric s past and future liquidity position and financial condition 
this subsection also includes a listing of ppl electric s current credit ratings 
financial condition risk management includes an explanation of ppl electric s risk management activities regarding commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
application of critical accounting policies provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of ppl electric and that require ppl electric s management to make significant estimates  assumptions and other judgments 
although ppl electric s management believes that these estimates  assumptions and other judgments are appropriate  they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  changes in the estimates  assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on ppl electric s results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in ppl electric s financial statements 
the information provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with ppl electric s financial statements and the accompanying notes

ppl electric s future earnings could be  or will be  impacted by a number of factors  including the following in march  ppl electric filed a request with the puc for an overall annual net increase in distribution rates of approximately million subsequently amended to million  based on a return on equity of  and notified the puc that it planned to pass through to customers approximately million in increased transmission charges imposed on ppl electric by pjm 
in december  the puc approved an increase in ppl electric s distribution rates of approximately million based on a return on equity of  and approved ppl electric s proposed mechanism for collecting the additional million in transmission related charges  for a total increase of approximately million  effective january  as discussed in item business background  ppl electric has agreed to provide electricity supply to its plr customers at predetermined rates through  and it has entered into puc approved  full requirements energy supply agreements with ppl energyplus to fulfill its plr obligation 
the predetermined charges for generation supply which ppl electric collects from its plr customers and pays to ppl energyplus under the energy supply agreements provide for annual increases in each year commencing in and continuing through ppl electric s plr obligation after will be determined by the puc pursuant to rules that have not yet been promulgated 
in january  severe ice storms hit ppl electric s service territory 
ppl electric had to restore service to about  customers 
although the actual cost of these storms and the specific allocation of such cost between operation and maintenance expense and capital costs is not yet finalized  ppl electric currently estimates a total cost of million  with approximately being expensed 
on february   ppl electric filed a petition with the puc for authority to defer and amortize for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes its actual cost of these storms  excluding capitalized costs of approximately million and regular payroll expenses of approximately million pursuant to puc precedent on this issue 
if the puc grants this petition  ppl electric s management at that time will assess the recoverability of these costs in ppl electric s next general rate increase proceeding 
based on the puc s action on the petition and management s assessment  ppl electric would either record these storm expenses  excluding regular payroll  as a regulatory asset in accordance with sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  or record these storm expenses on its income statement 
if the puc grants the petition before ppl electric files its form q for the first quarter of  the result of this assessment will be reflected in ppl electric s financial statements for the first quarter of if the puc has not acted on or has denied the petition by such date  ppl electric would record these storm expenses on its income statement 
at this time  ppl electric cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
see note to the financial statements for potential commitments and contingent liabilities that may impact future earnings 
see application of critical accounting policies for an overview of accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of ppl electric and that require ppl electric s management to make significant estimates  assumptions and other judgments

nbsp  nbsp  plr electric generation supply nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  electric delivery nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  delivery and plr supply to ppl generation nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  other nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the increase in revenues from retail electric operations for compared with was primarily due to higher plr revenues due to higher energy and capacity rates  and a increase in volume  in part due to the return of customers previously served by alternate suppliers  partially offset by lower electric delivery revenues due to a decrease in itc and ctc revenue as a result of lower itc rates  and several rate groups reaching their cap  and lower sales to ppl generation 
ppl generation s power plants began self supplying their station use in april  rather than taking supply from ppl electric 
the increase in revenues from retail electric operations for compared with was primarily due to higher plr revenues due to higher energy and capacity rates  and higher electric delivery revenues resulting from a increase in delivery sales  in part due to colder winter weather in the first quarter of  partially offset by lower sales to ppl generation 
ppl generation s power plants began self supplying their station use in april  rather than taking supply from ppl electric 
wholesale electric ppl electric wholesale revenues are derived from sales to municipalities 
the million decrease in wholesale electric revenues in compared with was due to the expiration of all municipal purchase power agreements at the end of january wholesale electric to affiliate ppl electric has a contract to sell to ppl energyplus the electricity that ppl electric purchases under contracts with nugs 
the termination of one nug contract in april and another in february caused ppl electric to purchase million less nug energy in compared to ppl electric therefore had less electricity to sell to ppl energyplus 
energy purchases from affiliate energy purchases from affiliate increased by million in compared with the increase reflects an increase in plr load  as well as higher prices for energy purchased under the power supply contracts with ppl energyplus needed to support plr load

taxes  other than income in the first quarter of  ppl electric reversed a million accrued liability for and purta taxes that had been accrued based on potential exposure in the proceedings regarding the susquehanna nuclear station tax assessment 
the rights of the third party intervenors to further appeal expired in the reversal is the primary reason for the million decrease in taxes in  compared with also contributing to the decrease was lower capital stock tax expense 
these decreases were partially offset by higher gross receipts tax expense 
taxes  other than income  increased by million in compared with due to the settlement of prior years capital stock tax refund claims of million in  and higher taxes related to an increase in the basis on which capital stock tax is calculated in workforce reduction see note to the financial statements for information on the charges recorded in and other income net see note to the financial statements for details of other income and deductions 
financing costs interest expense decreased by million in compared to and by million in compared to these decreases reflect the net impact of long term debt retirements 
over the past two years  million of long term debt retirements have occurred  while new issuances over the same period totaled million 
distributions on preferred securities decreased by million in compared to due to retirements and redemptions of preferred securities and preferred stock 
income taxes income tax expense decreased by million in compared with this decrease was primarily attributable to a million tax benefit recognized in related to a reduction in tax reserves associated with stranded costs securitization predicated upon management s reassessment of its best estimate of probable tax exposure  relative to  offset by a million increase in income tax expense related to higher pre tax book income 
income tax expense did not change for compared with this was due to lower pre tax book income  resulting in a million reduction in income taxes  offset by a million increase in income tax expense related to the filing of ppl electric s income tax returns 
annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns by taxing authorities 
however  the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues raised by such authorities may differ materially from the amount accrued 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  ppl electric accounts for changes in probable exposures based on management s best estimate of the amount that should be recognized 
an allowance is maintained for the tax contingencies  the balance of which management believes to be adequate 
during  ppl electric reached partial settlement with the irs with respect to the tax years through and received a cash refund in the amount of million 
as a result of this settlement  the net tax impact recorded in was not significant 
see note to the financial statements for details on effective income tax rates and other income tax related matters 
financial condition liquidity ppl electric is focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position and strengthening its balance sheet  thereby improving its credit profile 
ppl electric believes that its cash on hand  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity  taken as a whole  provide sufficient resources to fund its ongoing operating requirements  future security maturities and estimated future capital expenditures 
ppl electric currently expects cash on hand at the end of to be approximately million  with about million in credit facilities and up to million in short term debt capacity related to an asset backed commercial paper program 
however  ppl electric s cash flows from operations and its access to cost effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  the following unusual or extreme weather that may damage ppl electric s transmission and distribution facilities or affect energy sales to customers  ability to recover and the timeliness and adequacy of recovery of costs associated with regulated utility businesses  and a downgrade in ppl electric s credit ratings that could negatively affect its ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining credit facilities and any new debt 
at december   ppl electric had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term debt compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and no short term debt at december   and million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term debt at december  the million increase in short term debt from to resulted entirely from loan proceeds attributable to the asset backed commercial paper program  of which the full amount was used to cash collateralize letters of credit 
the change in short term debt from to reflects the repayment of ppl electric commercial paper 
the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulted from the following nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash provided by operating activities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash provided by used in investing activities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash used in financing activities nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  increase decrease in cash amp  cash equivalents nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in versus  reflecting primarily the receipt of million in cash collateral related to the plr energy supply agreements and a federal income tax refund 
an important element supporting the stability of ppl electric s cash from operations is its long term purchase contracts with ppl energyplus 
these contracts provide sufficient energy for ppl electric to meet its plr obligation through  at the predetermined capped rates it is entitled to charge its customers over this period 
these contracts require cash collateral or other credit enhancement  or reductions or terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement in the event of a downgrade of ppl electric or adverse changes in market prices 
for example  if ppl electric s ratings were lowered to below investment grade and energy prices decreased by from year end or price levels  ppl electric estimates that  based on its december  positions  it would not have had to post additional collateral compared to million at december  the maximum amount that ppl electric would have to post under these contracts is million 
the increase of million in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to reflected working capital improvements resulting from a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable 
the savings from a workforce reduction program that was commenced in was more than offset by rising transmission and distribution operating costs 
net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by million in versus primarily as a result of initiating a million demand loan to an affiliate 
the primary use of cash for investing activities is capital and investment expenditures 
see capital expenditure requirements for capital and investment expenditures in and expected expenditures in through in  ppl electric expects to be able to fund all of its capital expenditures with cash from operations 
the increase of million in net cash used in investing activities in compared to was primarily the result of a lower loan repayment by an affiliate 
net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased by million in compared to  due to the lack of new long term debt issuances in compared to million in in  the million of cash used in financing activities consisted of net debt retirements of million and common and preferred dividends of million 
ppl electric s debt financing activity in was as follows nbsp  nbsp  issuances nbsp  nbsp  retirements nbsp  ppl transition bond company transition bonds nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  ppl electric first mortgage bonds nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  ppl electric senior secured bonds nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  ppl electric asset backed commercial paper net change nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  total nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  net reduction nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  debt issued during had stated interest rates ranging from to and with maturities in or see note to the financial statements for more detailed information regarding ppl electric s financing activities 
in march  ppl electric reactivated its commercial paper program to provide it with an additional financing source to fund its short term liquidity needs  if and when necessary 
at december   ppl electric had no commercial paper outstanding 
in august  ppl electric began participating in an asset backed commercial paper program through which ppl electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose  wholly owned subsidiary on an ongoing basis 
the subsidiary pledges these assets to secure loans of up to an aggregate of million from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by a financial institution 
ppl electric expects to use the proceeds from the program for general corporate purposes and to cash collateralize letters of credit 
at december   the loan balance outstanding was million  all of which was being used to cash collateralize letters of credit 
at december   ppl electric s total committed borrowing capacity under credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were as follows nbsp  nbsp  committed capacity nbsp  nbsp  borrowed nbsp  nbsp  letters of credit issued b nbsp  nbsp  available capacity nbsp  ppl electric credit facilities a nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  a nbsp  ppl electric s credit facilities allow for borrowings at libor based rates plus a spread  depending upon the company s public debt rating 
ppl electric also has the capability to cause the lenders to issue up to million of letters of credit under these facilities  which issuances reduce available borrowing capacity 
the credit facilities contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization to not exceed 
at december  and  ppl electric s consolidated debt to total capitalization percentages  as calculated in accordance with its credit facilities  were and 
the credit facilities also contain certain representations and warranties that must be made for ppl electric to borrow under them  including  but not limited to  a material adverse change clause that relates to ppl electric s ability to perform its obligations under the credit agreements and related loan documents 
b nbsp  ppl electric has a reimbursement obligation to the extent any letters of credit are drawn 
these credit agreements contain various other covenants 
failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of due dates of borrowings and or termination of the agreements 
ppl electric monitors the covenants on a regular basis 
at december   ppl electric was in material compliance with those covenants 
at this time ppl electric believes that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources 
ppl electric s senior secured bond indenture restricts dividend payments in the event that ppl electric fails to meet interest coverage ratios or fails to comply with certain requirements included in its articles of incorporation and bylaws to maintain its separateness from ppl and ppl s other subsidiaries 
ppl electric does not  at this time  expect that any of such limitations would significantly impact its ability to declare dividends 
the decrease of million in net cash used in financing activities in compared to reflects the repayment of long term debt 
in  the million of cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net debt retirements of million  preferred stock retirements of million  and common and preferred dividends paid of million  offset by a contribution from parent of million 
operating leases ppl electric has operating lease agreements to lease vehicles  office space  land  buildings  personal computers and other equipment 
these leasing structures provide ppl electric with additional operating and financing flexibility 
the operating leases contain covenants that are typical for these agreements  such as maintaining insurance  maintaining corporate existence and timely payment of rent and other fees 
failure to meet these covenants could limit or restrict access to these funds or require early payment of obligations

application of critical accounting policies ppl electric s financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods  assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies 
the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of ppl electric  and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements 
these accounting policies are also discussed in note to the financial statements 
ppl s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions regarding them  with its audit committee 
in addition  ppl s senior management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
pension and other postretirement benefits as described in note to the financial statements  ppl electric participates in  and is allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic pension cost of the ppl retirement plan and the ppl postretirement benefit plan 
ppl follows the guidance of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance  but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long term returns on those asset classes 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs ppl electric records currently 
rate of compensation increase management projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
health care cost trend rate management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 
in selecting discount rates  ppl considers fixed income security yield rates 
at december   ppl decreased the discount rate for its domestic plans from to as a result of decreased fixed income security returns 
in selecting an expected return on plan assets  ppl considers tax implications  past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
at december   ppl s expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans remained at 
in selecting a rate of compensation increase  ppl considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   ppl s rate of compensation increase remained at for its domestic plans 
in selecting health care cost trend rates  ppl considers past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
at december nbsp   ppl s health care cost trend rates were for  gradually declining to for a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on the accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost allocated to ppl electric 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities in the financial statements associated with a change in certain assumptions 
while the chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption  the inverse of this change would impact the accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost by a similar amount in the opposite direction 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 
nbsp  nbsp  increase decrease nbsp  actuarial assumption nbsp  change in assumption nbsp  nbsp  impact on liabilities nbsp  nbsp  impact on cost nbsp  discount rate nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  expected return on plan assets nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  rate of compensation increase nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  at december   ppl electric s balance sheet reflected a net liability of million for pension liabilities and prepaid other postretirement benefit costs allocated from plans sponsored by ppl services 
in  ppl electric was allocated net periodic pension and other postretirement costs charged to operating expense of million 
this amount represents a million reduction in the charge recognized during this reduction was primarily due to decreased postretirement costs resulting from increased employee cost sharing  offset by increased pension costs resulting from the decrease in the discount rate at december  refer to note to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits 
loss accruals ppl electric periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and ppl electric s accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas  accounting for contingencies 
sfas defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
fasb defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur 
sfas does not permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains 
ppl electric continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation  litigation claims  income taxes  regulatory penalties and other events 
ppl electric also has accrued estimated losses on long term purchase commitments when significant events have occurred 
for example  estimated losses were accrued when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
under regulatory accounting  ppl electric recorded the above market cost of energy purchases from nugs as part of its purchased power costs on an as incurred basis  since these costs were recovered in regulated rates 
when the generation business was deregulated  the estimated loss associated with these long term purchase commitments to make above market nug purchases was recorded because ppl electric was committed to purchase electricity at above market prices but it could no longer recover these costs in regulated rates 
the accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include the initial identification and recording of the loss  the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual  and the on going assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient 
all three aspects of accounting for loss accruals the initial identification and recording of a probable loss  the identification of triggering events to reduce the loss accrual  and the ongoing assessment of the sufficiency of a recorded loss accrual require significant judgment by ppl electric s management 
initial identification and recording of the loss accrual ppl electric uses its internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers  tax specialists and engineers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
ppl electric has identified certain events which could give rise to a loss  but which do not meet the conditions for accrual under sfas sfas requires disclosure  but not a recording  of potential losses when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred 
the fasb defines reasonably possible as cases in which the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely 
see note to the financial statements for disclosure of potential loss contingencies  most of which have not met the criteria for accrual under sfas reducing recorded loss accruals when an estimated loss is accrued  ppl electric identifies  where applicable  the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual 
the triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is incurred  or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated 
the following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals certain loss accruals are systematically reduced based on the expiration of contract terms 
an example of this is the loss accrual for above market nug purchase commitments  which is described below 
this loss accrual is being reduced over the lives of the nug purchase contracts 
allowances for excess or obsolete inventory are reduced as the inventory items are pulled from the warehouse shelves and sold as scrap or otherwise disposed 
allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted or when underlying amounts are ultimately collected 
environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and ppl electric makes actual payments or the loss is no longer considered probable 
on going assessment of recorded loss accruals ppl electric reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient 
this involves on going communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel  engineers  tax specialists  operation management and other parties 
the largest loss accrual that had been on ppl electric s balance sheet was for an impairment of above market nug purchase commitments 
this loss accrual reflected the estimated difference between the above market contract terms  under the purchase commitments  and the fair value of the electricity to be purchased 
this loss accrual was originally recorded at million in  when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
this loss accrual was transferred to ppl energyplus in the july   corporate realignment 
when the loss accrual related to nug purchases was recorded in  ppl electric established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be reduced 
a schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases over the lives of the nug contracts 
all but one of the nug contracts expire by  with the last one ending in prior to the july  transfer  ppl electric reduced the above market nug liability based on the aforementioned schedule 
as ppl electric reduced the liability for the above market nug purchases  it offset the actual cost of nug purchases  thereby bringing the net power purchase expense more in line with market prices
