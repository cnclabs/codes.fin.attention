item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands of dollars overview allied is a strategic portfolio of defense and security businesses  with presence in worldwide markets  offering both government and commercial customers leading edge products and services 
allied operates in four principal segments ordnance manufacturing segment consists of mecar  located in belgium  and mecar usa  located in marshall  tx 
mecar develops and produces medium caliber tank  mortar and other ammunition 
mecar usa will initially pursue contracts from us and foreign governments for ammunition and pyrotechnics devices 
mecar usa is expected to be operational in mid electronic security segment consists of the vsk group  located in belgium and california  and ns microwave  located in san diego  ca 
the vsk group consists of vsk electronics nv which manufactures access control  intrusion protection  fire detection and video systems  t l technique g n rale sa which installs security systems  intelligent data capturing systems nv which manufacturers integrated video systems  vigitec nv which installs networked video surveillance systems  and control monitor systems which manufactures access control systems 
ns microwave designs  manufactures  distributes and services industrial and law enforcement surveillance products and systems 
environmental safety security segment consists of seaspace  located in san diego  ca  which designs  manufactures  distributes and services weather and environmental satellite ground reception systems  and which has begun to manufacture and market antenna products 
software  training simulation segment consists of titan dynamics  located in marshall  tx  which designs  manufactures and sells battlefield effects simulators  minor pyrotechnics and other training devices 
allied  the parent company  provides management services to its subsidiaries and has no operating activities 
due to the historic volatility in mecar s business  in the mid s allied acquired the vsk group with a goal of attempting to diversify its operations 
the company continued its diversification efforts in late and into mid with the acquisitions of ns microwave  titan dynamics and seaspace 
in mid  the vsk group acquired control monitor systems with a goal of using it as a vehicle to sell vsk group products in north america 
in late  allied organized mecar usa to pursue ammunition and related opportunities from us and other markets 
mecar usa will initially focus on contracts for ammunition and pyrotechnics devices 
mecar usa will operate from marshall  texas 
it is scheduled to commence operations in mid in  allied obtained an  domestic lending facility in order to continue its acquisition program 
allied enters with substantial cash reserves and anticipates no liquidity concerns in restatement as set forth in the form k filed on march   allied will restate its financial statements for and and for the first three quarters of due to its not qualifying for the use of hedge accounting under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities for foreign currency exchange contracts fx contracts 
the restatements are contained in this annual report on form k for the period ended december  see notes a and v to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the restatement 
mecar s functional currency is the euro and certain of its sales contracts are priced in us dollars 
to offset the fluctuations that occur between the us dollar and the euro  mecar enters into fx contracts and had accounted for these contracts as fair value hedges using hedge accounting in  it was determined that the company could not support the use of hedge accounting for the fx contracts entered into by mecar 
for a fx contract to be eligible for hedge accounting under fas  the company must demonstrate the risk objective and the nature of the risk being hedged  the date of designation for each fx contract  the type of hedge instrument which in the company s case was a firm sales commitment  a description of the hedged transaction  and formal documentation showing how the foreign currency transaction was evaluated to determine if the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk during the period the hedge is designated 
while the company believes it satisfied the first four conditions  the company did not evaluate the effectiveness of the foreign currency transaction at its inception to determine if it qualified for hedge accounting 
additionally  the company failed to evaluate these transactions on a periodic basis to determine their effectiveness 
as noted above  the company s foreign currency contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting for the periods since it did not test and document the effectiveness of the fx contracts 
the company has engaged an outside financial consultant experienced in these matters who will assist the company in its future testing documentation which should allow the company to use hedge accounting for all future fx contracts 
the change from hedge to derivative accounting had no impact on the company s cash position 
at december   the company had  and  of unrestricted cash and restricted cash  respectively 
during periods of currency fluctuations  there will be changes in the fair value of an fx contract 
hedge accounting generally allows changes in the fair value of an fx contract to be offset against corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged asset until the fx contract is closed at which time a gain or loss is then recognized 
derivative accounting requires that all changes in the fair value of an fx contract be recognized as a gain or loss in each reporting period without a corresponding offset 
this difference between hedge and derivative accounting results in timing differences in the reporting of operating results 
such timing differences should offset over the life of the contract 
mecar generally has one or more us dollar customer contracts and mecar normally enters into fx contracts to hedge the foreign currency risks contained in those contracts 
in  mecar executed an approximately  multi year contract 
this was one of the largest contracts in its history  as well as one of the longest in duration  and mecar entered into a number of fx contracts to minimize the currency exposure on this usd based asset 
as a result  mecar entered into a number of fx contracts in the time period  thus the requirement to use derivative accounting had a substantial impact on the operating results for these periods 
the last shipment under the  customer contract approximately  was made in early and the final payment is expected to be made within the first quarter of further  the corresponding fx contracts will be closed out upon receipt of the final payment 
at december   mecar has an aggregate of  fx contracts outstanding 
due to the failure of the company to properly document and test the fx contracts currently outstanding  all of these remaining hedge instruments will be accounted for in as derivatives 
as a result  while the use of derivative accounting will have an impact on results  it is not expected to have the same degree of impact which it had during the periods thru management believes that the financial results determined using hedge accounting better describe the underlying economics of the company than the results determined under derivative accounting 
derivative accounting requires a quarterly adjustment to the bottom line based on currency fluctuations 
this can require recognition of substantial profits and or losses unrelated to the performance of the underlying customer contract 
specifically  in mecar entered into a number of substantial fx contracts amounting to  to hedge its exposure to a usd based contract awarded to it in the year 
subsequently  there was a substantial strengthening of the value of the euro during the year that resulted in large unrealized gains on those contracts 
derivative accounting required that the company accrue over  revenue and pre tax profits for this currency fluctuation even though mecar performed relatively modest amounts of work on the contract 
in contrast  hedge accounting only required the company to take fx contracts into consideration with respect to the revenue based on the amount of work performed on the underlying customer contracts 
this difference in the two accounting methods is reflected in the substantial change in net earnings for as set forth below 
since hedge accounting permits us to give effect to the fx contracts in direct proportion to our work on the underlying customer contracts  management believes that it yields a more representative reflection of our operations 
these hedge contracts provided us the currency risk protection we sought during a period when the euro appreciated over versus the us dollar 
management uses the results generated by hedge accounting for its internal purposes 
these purposes include measurement of performance versus budget plan  analysis of variances from budget plan  satisfaction of management performance objectives for bonus compensation consideration  etc 
as noted above  management has already taken the steps necessary to return to hedge accounting for all future fx contracts 
inasmuch as the company historically used hedge accounting for all years through  and expects to use hedge accounting for all future fx contracts  management is concerned that readers of the company s financial statements may find it difficult to compare the company s performance during this period to prior and subsequent periods 
accordingly  management has decided to present certain pro forma data for the periods  next to the restated data 
the pro forma data was prepared using hedge accounting  whereas the restated data was prepared using derivative accounting 
the and pro forma data is identical to the data contained in the previously issued form k 
the pro forma data represents what the company s financial performance would have been if it had been eligible to use hedge accounting for each fx contract entered into over the three year period 
the pro forma and restated data are as follows condensed consolidated statements of earnings years ended december  pro forma as as previously as as previously actual unaudited restated reported restated reported revenues cost of sales operating income earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings earnings per share basic diluted reconciliation between pro forma and actual results a reconciliation of the audited results to the pro forma as previously reported results is as follows as impact from impact from pro forma restated derivative gains euro fluctuations unaudited year ended december  revenues cost of sales operating income earnings before income income taxes net earnings as as previously restated reported year ended december  revenues cost of sales operating income earnings before income income taxes net earnings as as previously restated reported year ended december  revenues cost of sales operating income earnings before income income taxes net earnings cumulative net earnings unrealized gains on fx contracts and related tax effects 
impact of revising the revenues at the average rates and related tax effects 
the balance of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to and is based upon the restated financial statements  computed using derivative accounting 
results of operations the results were positively affected by the translation of the company s european operations euro based income statements into dollars at more favorable exchange rates 
all euro based results of operations were converted at the average  and exchange rates of  and us dollar to euro  respectively 
the following table sets forth  for the years ended december   and  certain items from allied s consolidated statements of earnings expressed as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december  revenue cost and expenses cost of sales selling and administrative research and development operating income other income expense interest income interest expense other net earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings compared to compared to revenues 
allied s consolidated revenues for decreased from principally due to lower production activities in the ordnance manufacturing segment  offset by higher production activities within the electronic security segment 
allied s consolidated revenues for increased over revenue by segment amount amount amount ordnance manufacturing electronic security environmental safety security software  training simulation ordnance manufacturing segment revenue decreased in from levels as a result of reduced activity on the approximately  foreign military sales fms contract which is in its final stages 
while mecar continues to meet the ammunition needs of its traditional customers  it is actively seeking to diversify its customer base 
ordinance manufacturing segment revenues increased slightly in due to continued performance of the multi year fms contract as well as work on additional orders secured from non traditional customers 
ordnance manufacturing segment revenue in was positively affected by approximately  of fx contract gain based on derivative accounting 
electronic security segment revenue increased in over levels 
the increase at the vsk group is principally the result of continued expansion of its export sales via its european distribution network 
ns microwave s business has improved due to receipt of some additional us government orders in  including two large contracts 
electronic security segment revenue also increased in  although the mix was substantially different 
the vsk group contributed  a increase over  largely due to increased sales to non belgian customers 
ns microwave s revenues decreased by  many of ns microwave s traditional us government agency customers were reorganized into the department of homeland security 
the organization and startup of the department of homeland security was marked by a delay in award of contracts by these agencies 
while ns microwave began to receive some orders in the fourth quarter of  it was too late to realize meaningful revenues from some of these orders in environmental safety security segment revenue decreased in as a result of fewer satellite launches  delayed projects and increased competition 
management believes that world wide satellite launches will show year over year growth starting in environmental safety security segment revenue increased in over revenues as a result of only five months of activity in software  training simulation segment revenue decreased in from levels 
titan dynamics is diversifying its customer base in light of the lack of safety certification for its principal product 
titan dynamics revenue is now largely comprised of cartridge sales for previously sold simulators and new e pyro products used for military and law enforcement training 
software  training simulation segment revenues increased in inasmuch as revenues included only six months of operations following the june  acquisition of titan dynamics 
revenues continue to be constrained due to the lack of safety certification for the omega b battlefield effects simulator 
testing by the marine corps is substantially complete and titan dynamics is optimistic that it will receive marine corps certification of this product by the end of the third quarter of certification should also accelerate penetration in foreign markets 
further  marine corps certification should facilitate and accelerate certification by the us army 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for was approximately compared with in the decrease during was driven by lower costs within the ordnance manufacturing and environmental safety security segments 
ordnance manufacturing cost of sales decreased from primarily from the fms contract 
electronic security segment cost of sales decreased from primarily due to the vsk group s production efficiencies realized as it expanded its distribution channel throughout europe 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for was approximately compared with for the majority of the increase during was driven by currency derivative impacts and the balance is attributable to other factors  including higher costs within the ordnance manufacturing segment 
the costs were primarily related to the fms contract which dominated the production process in that year 
additionally  mecar incurred higher than anticipated labor costs due to production delays surrounding a mm production order 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for was higher than the ordnance manufacturing segment incurred higher administrative compensation costs 
in the electronic security segment  the vsk group also incurred higher costs that were driven by the increased sales volume 
seaspace incurred substantial legal expenses associated with a dispute with a former distributor 
the dispute was settled in march because of rapid growth  ns microwave incurred somewhat higher than normal administrative costs 
within the increased costs were those associated with acquiring additional production space 
selling and administrative costs at corporate increased due to sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
selling and administrative expenses in increased by  over the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the additions of ns microwave  titan dynamics and seaspace 
ns microwave was consolidated on a full year basis in while titan dynamics and seaspace were second and third quarter additions 
research and development 
research and development costs increased steadily between and the total dollar increase was primarily attributed to increased research conducted at mecar  the vsk group  ns microwave and seaspace 
this trend is expected to continue 
interest income 
interest income increased between and income earned on interest bearing accounts throughout the company has been affected by the higher interest rates being earned on such accounts 
in contrast  interest income decreased between and due to lower interest rates being earned on such accounts 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased between and due principally to  of principal payments on the convertible debenture during in contrast  interest expense increased between and due principally to the costs associated with a convertible debenture issued in the second quarter of the principal payments commenced in june other net 
other net income for decreased from and other net income for decreased from this stemmed primarily from the currency fluctuations at mecar and the vsk group 
in particular  mecar had currency gains in on its us bank accounts 
subsequently  mecar incurred currency losses in and on its us bank accounts due the strength of the euro 
the currency loss also included losses on a foreign sales contract that could not be hedged due to bank constraints on its working line of credit facility 
pre tax profit 
pre tax profit loss by segment ordnance manufacturing electronic security environmental safety security software  training simulation corporate and other within the ordnance and manufacturing segment  mecar was less profitable than it has been in the past 
while a portion of the decrease was expected due to the lack of a large high margin contract in mecar s backlog  the changes noted above are also affected by the required change to derivative accounting described above 
this change required recognition of  derivative gain in unrelated to work performed on the underlying customer contract 
electronic security segment pre tax profit increased from levels due to increased business activity at ns microwave  largely from us government contracts 
the vsk group s per tax profit was materially consistent between and profits within the electronic security segment decreased from levels despite record performance by the vsk group 
ns microwave s performance suffered due to delays in award of orders caused in part by the organization of the department of homeland security 
environmental safety security segment pre tax loss in resulted from increased development costs associated with new antenna products expected to be available for sale in  substantial legal expenses associated with a dispute with a former distributor see note n and delayed contracts 
the dispute was settled in march seaspace has taken efforts to right size its organization in light of the competitive environment 
software  training simulation pre tax loss in results from titan dynamic s principal product lacking us government safety certification 
titan dynamics anticipates receipt of navy marine corp certification in corporate and other segment loss increased in due to sarbanes oxley implementation costs and reduced intercompany management fee adjustments 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rates in  and was  and  respectively 
these large fluctuations are primarily due to the reclassification of foreign currency hedge contracts as derivatives 
the company s adoption of derivative accounting resulted in the recording of substantial unrealized gains and losses and their related tax effects 
net earnings 
net earnings decreased from levels 
the winding down of mecar s fms contract had a meaningful impact on overall profitability 
this was mitigated by good news from ns microwave  which experienced its best year ever in terms of top line growth 
the electronic security segment performed well 
losses incurred by allied s other domestic subsidiaries continued 
both seaspace and titan dynamics posted losses for the year 
net earnings decreased substantially from levels 
the decrease was overwhelmingly the result of gains on derivative contracts 
there was also some decrease as a result of losses incurred by the company s us subsidiaries 
backlog 
as of december   the company s backlog was  compared to  at december  and  at december  the and amounts included unfunded portions from an indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq federal contract 
backlog by segment december  december  december  percentage percentage percentage amount of total amount of total amount of total ordnance manufacturing electronic security environmental safety security software  training simulation the decrease in backlog is primarily the result of mecar s work on the approximately  fms multi year contract awarded in february mecar has undertaken a customer diversification effort in the past few years 
in addition to meeting the ammunition needs of its traditional customers  mecar has gained new customers which have contributed to a majority of its new orders for electronic security backlog increased from new contracts received at the vsk group and ns microwave 
electronic security s and backlogs include unfunded portions of  and  respectively  from an idiq federal contract 
liquidity and capital resources american jobs creation act of allied s cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the us most of the amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us  but  under current law  would be subject to federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
allied has provided for the us federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes  except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us the american jobs creation act of  enacted on october  the jobs act  provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the us pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by its board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
the company is in the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate any foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act and  if so  the amount that it will repatriate 
the company is awaiting the issuance of further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions in the jobs act 
as of december   the company had not decided whether  and to what extent  the company might repatriate foreign earnings under the jobs act 
the company expects to make that determination upon the issuance of further regulatory and legislative guidance 
since there are many outstanding factors that will impact the ultimate tax liability on any foreign earnings that could be repatriated pursuant to the jobs act  the range of the income tax effects of such repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
balance sheet 
all items on the company s december  consolidated balance sheet were affected by the increased value of the euro in all euro based activity was converted at the december  and closing exchange rate of and us dollar to euro  respectively 
historically  the company s positive cash flow from operations and available credit facilities have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fully fund the company s operational needs 
working capital  which includes restricted cash  was  at december   which is a decrease of  from the december  level 
working capital remains strong due to profitable operations 
cash decreased primarily from  of payments on the convertible debenture and the repayment of current liabilities including mecar s short term borrowings 
the amount of cash required to be restricted decreased in due to completion of certain contracts at mecar 
this was offset by the  deposit required under the senior loan facility obtained on may  accounts receivable increased due to higher shipments in fourth quarter versus fourth quarter costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased from year end primarily as a result of continued work on mecar contracts 
inventories increased primarily from higher raw material purchases 
the inventory buildup will give the subsidiaries the ability to deliver products with the shortest possible lead times 
fair value of foreign exchange contracts was  at december   compared to  at december  mecar uses foreign currency derivative contracts to minimize the foreign currency exposures that arise from sales contracts with certain foreign customers 
prepaid and other current assets decreased primarily from lower prepaid taxes at mecar in property  plant equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased primarily from equipment purchases at the business units during intangibles decreased primarily from the amortization of capitalized software  customer lists and patents 
goodwill increased as a result of the acquisition of control monitor systems on august  as well as the currency translation adjustment 
notes payable decreased from december  as a result of mecar paying off a short term loan 
during  mecar used its cash from operations for working capital needs 
accounts payable decreased as a result of lower production costs  primarily at mecar 
accrued liabilities decreased due primarily to the costs associated with deferred gains related to forward exchange contracts at mecar 
customer deposits increased primarily at mecar as a result of shipments during the period and other new contracts in requiring deposits 
income taxes decreased due to the tax provisions at mecar and the vsk group  offset by the tax benefits at ns microwave  seaspace  titan dynamics and corporate 
convertible subordinated debenture  current and long term  decreased from december  to december  as the company commenced its monthly principal payments on june  monthly payments will continue through march stockholders equity as of december   was positively affected by the increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar  resulting in an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the euro appreciated by approximately since the beginning of the year 
cash flows 
the table below provides the summary cash flow data for the periods presented for the years ended december net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating activities 
the company generated  of cash in its operating activities during whereas it generated  of cash during the same period of this is attributed primarily to three factors 
first  the company s earnings were less in than in second  the company paid substantial short term liabilities  which included sarbanes oxley compliance costs and legal costs associated with a dispute  which was settled in march third  the company collected less cash on shipments to customers 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities between and is attributed collection of receivables and decreased cash outlays for cost and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts  which are mainly from mecar s and the vsk group s customer base 
cash paid for interest was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash paid for income taxes was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and includes federal  foreign and state taxes 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities increased between and this stemmed from higher capital expenditures for production equipment at the vsk group and antenna products at seaspace  as well as the acquisition of control monitor systems by the vsk group 
cash used in investing activities decreased between and this stemmed from cash paid for the titan dynamics and seaspace acquisitions in  with no related acquisition activity in this decrease was offset by a slight increase in capital expenditures due primarily to higher outlays for production equipment and leasehold improvements at the belgian business units 
the company anticipates that cash generated from operations and capital leases will be sufficient to support any further capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
future expenditures will be primarily incurred at mecar for machinery and equipment and a surface treatment plant in preparation for compliance with new environment safety regulations  of which the total estimated costs have yet to be finalized 
financing activities 
the company used  of cash in financing activities during whereas it generated of cash during the same period of this stemmed from substantial payments on short term borrowings and the convertible debenture  offset by proceeds of long term debt  in particular the senior secured facility  as well as a decrease in the amount of cash required to be restricted due to completion of certain contracts at mecar 
cash provided by financing activities decreased between and during  the primary source of cash provided by financing activities was the  proceeds realized from the sale of the convertible debenture and warrant 
allied 
the parent company continues to operate based on fees and dividends received from its subsidiaries 
allied has made cash infusions to seaspace  ns microwave and titan dynamics to support working capital requirements 
on may  the company obtained a senior loan facility under which the company may borrow up to  for acquisitions and working capital 
at closing  the company borrowed  and deposited  in a restricted account to secure the repayment 
the facility allows the company to make additional draws under the facility under certain conditions through november  all loans under the facility bear interest at the rate of per year payable monthly 
principal is paid in sixty equal monthly payments commencing in late december the company pays a fee on the unused portion of the facility 
warrants exercisable at per share to purchase  shares of the company s common stock were issued at closing and were valued at additional warrants at the rate of  for each million loan will be issued with future loan advances 
in addition  the company incurred of closing costs related to this facility 
the facility includes certain financial and other covenants 
the company is currently in compliance with those covenants 
mecar 
mecar continues to operate from internally generated cash and funds provided by its bank syndicate and financing from capital leases 
mecar typically obtains orders for its ammunition and weapon systems that require credit facilities to provide advance payment guarantees and performance bonds 
these needs have been met in the last few years via agreements with a five member international bank syndicate 
while the bank syndicate agreement provides that mecar is responsible to repay the syndicate for amounts paid by the banks pursuant to the guarantees bonds  the financial terms stipulate that all such obligations be secured  in part  by a cash pledge 
the bank syndicate agreement provides the banks the right to review and approve each proposed mecar contract before agreeing to provide the necessary letters of credit  guarantee and or bond 
while management believes that it will be able to finance additional mecar contracts using the bank syndicate structure  there can be no assurance that such financing will be unconditionally and permanently provided 
the bank syndicate agreement provides i lines of credit for tax prepayments and working capital  ii a facility for guarantees bonds to support customer contracts and iii support in establishing a foreign currency hedge on its us dollar based production contracts 
the financial lending terms and fees are denominated in euros and the dollar equivalents will fluctuate according to global economic conditions 
the revised bank agreement  as executed in march  eliminates most restrictions on cash transfers by mecar to allied or other allied group companies 
however  the agreement imposes two financial covenants requiring mecar to maintain minimum net worth and working capital levels 
as of december   mecar was in compliance with both of these bank covenants 
mecar s obligations under the bank syndicate agreement continue to be collateralized by a pledge of mecar s assets 
the agreement includes allied s pledge to support mecar so that it remains in compliance with its total borrowing obligations 
vsk group 
the vsk group operated throughout solely from cash generated from business operations 
the vsk group is obligated on several mortgages and other long term obligations 
other subsidiaries 
ns microwave  titan dynamics and seaspace operated in from cash generated from operations and cash infusions by allied 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
as described herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  allied has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect its financial condition 
however  based on management s assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of the material contractual obligations and commercial commitments of allied  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on allied s financial condition or results of operations 
the following table identifies material contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period amount in s less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations convertible debenture operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations commercial commitments total bank guarantees future liquidity 
the company continues to explore alternate methods of securing the necessary financial capacity to implement its growth plans 
at times  the company has utilized the services of an investment banker in an attempt to secure financing 
funds for the build out of the initial mecar usa infrastructure are being provided by the marshall economic development corporation of marshall  texas 
this is a state funded organization with the initial proceeds directed at creating roads and a manufacturing plant on the grounds 
the company s ability to cover its anticipated future operating and capital requirements is dependent upon its continued ability to generate positive cash flow from the operations of its subsidiaries  particularly the operations of mecar and the vsk group  and its ability to successfully integrate its acquisitions 
the company expects its acquisitions to be accretive to operations within months  although this cannot be assured 
this will depend upon many factors including the successful release of new product offerings  successful research and development efforts  and increased market share 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
mecar is required to provide performance bonds and advance payment guarantees for certain contracts  which are provided by mecar s bank syndicate 
mecar is obligated to repay the bank syndicate any amounts it pays as a result of any demands on the bonds or guarantees 
to date  there have never been any such demands 
recent accounting pronouncements 
see note a to allied s consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
allied does not anticipate that any of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial results 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company re evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies which affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method goodwill and intangible asset valuation inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts derivative instruments valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on fixed price contracts for which we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method is used by mecar  ns microwave  and seaspace for substantially all of their fixed price sales contracts 
approximately  and of consolidated revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method during   and  respectively 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue is recognized on these contracts as work progresses during the period  based on the amount of actual cost incurred during the period compared to total estimated cost to be incurred for the total contract cost to cost method 
management reviews these estimates as work progresses and the effect of any change in cost estimates is reflected in cost of sales in the period in which the change is identified 
if the contract is projected to create a loss  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period such loss first becomes known 
accounting for the profit on a contract requires the total contract value  the estimated total cost to complete  which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract s scope of work  and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the difference between the contract value and the estimated total cost at completion 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
a number of internal and external factors affect our cost of sales estimates  including labor rates and efficiency variances  material usage variances  delivery schedules and testing requirements 
additionally  as inventory items increase in age  obsolete and excess items are charged to cost of sales if the economic conditions of the future sales potential of that inventory warrant a charge 
while we believe that the systems and procedures used by the subsidiaries  coupled with the experience of their management teams  provide a sound basis for our estimates  actual results will differ from management s estimates 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation 
the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles with definitive lives and other costs 
as of december   the company has million of goodwill recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill  the company completed a goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and determined that an impairment charge to earnings was not required 
as required by the new rules  the company will perform a similar review each year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future cash flows discounted at the company s weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
if market conditions in these business units fail to meet expectations  it could negatively impact revenue or cost  and could result in charges for the impairment of goodwill in future periods 
for intangible assets with definitive lives  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset 
as of december   the company had million of intangible assets with definitive lives  which includes patents  customer lists  trademarks  etc 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur charges to reflect the impairment of these assets 
impairment could also result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if the market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable 
inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on a first in  first out basis 
the company s inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods of million as of december  the company reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a write down for obsolete or slow moving items to their net realizable value 
the write down is based on current and forecasted demand and the age of the item  and therefore  if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
allowances for doubtful accounts are evaluated based upon detailed analysis and assessment of receivables that may not be collected in the normal course of operations 
derivatives instruments 
the company designates its derivatives based upon the criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for the changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for a derivative designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the risk being hedged 
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedge exposure effects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is reported in earnings immediately 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge  the change in fair value is recognized currently in net income 
valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
the company is subject to taxation by federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time 
the company believes that it has recorded adequate liabilities and reviews those balances on a quarterly basis 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the company and the industries in which it operates 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions future factors which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors include the following substantial reliance on mecar s principal customers to continue to acquire products on a regular basis  the cyclical nature of the company s military business  rapid technological developments and changes and the company s ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely  cost effective basis  the ability of the company to successfully continue to expand its business base  the ability of the company s acquired businesses to mature and meet performance expectations  the mix of products services  domestic and foreign governmental fiscal affairs and public policy changes which may affect the level of purchases made by customers  changes in environmental and other domestic and foreign governmental regulations  general risks associated with doing business outside the united states  including  without limitation  import duties  tariffs  quotas and political and economic instability  the effects of terrorist actions on business activities  customer orders and cancellations  and the united states and international governments responses to these terrorist actions  changes in government regulations  liability and other claims asserted against us  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and continued availability of financing  financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts  at the times  and on the terms required to support the company s future business 
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors can arise and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates changes 
from time to time  we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
our derivatives are agreements with independent third parties that provide for payments based on a notional amount 
as of december  and  all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives 
however  we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties  all of whom we either consider credit worthy  or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate sensitivity 
allied manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
at december   allied had approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness 
allied has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness 
cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in days or money market funds 
in general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end cash available for investment including restricted cash  a change in interest rates would impact net interest income for the years ended december   and by million  million and million  respectively 
exchange rate sensitivity 
allied maintains operations in several foreign countries 
approximately of the company s revenue was derived from operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rates 
allied s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the allied subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
allied does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in the value of the euro would impact reported net earnings for the years ending december   and by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
see note o to the financial statements for more information on financial instruments 
allied does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does allied hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
allied regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program
