table of contents part i item business who we are we are a national provider of professional and technical specialty staffing services 
kforce was formed in august as a result of the combination of romac associates  inc and three of its largest franchises 
following an initial public offering in august  kforce grew to offices in major markets 
on april   kforce consummated a merger whereby source services corporation source  was merged into kforce 
on june   we completed a transaction whereby hall  kinion and associates  inc was merged into kforce 
this transaction is discussed in further detail later in item at december   we operated field offices in markets and we currently provide services in states through these offices or from our headquarters in tampa  florida 
kforce currently has no operations outside the united states 
we provide our clients staffing services through three business segments technology tech  finance and accounting fa  and health and life sciences hls 
substantially all tech and fa services are sold and delivered through our field offices 
the hls segment includes our clinical research formerly pharmaceutical  scientific  healthcare nursing nursing and healthcare non nursing med records specialties 
the sales and delivery functions of substantial portions of hls  particularly clinical research and med records  are concentrated in our headquarters  with services being provided for certain clients through our field offices 
our headquarters provides support services to our field offices in areas such as human resources  nationwide recruiting  training  and national sales initiatives  in addition to the traditional back office support services such as payroll  billing  accounting  legal  tax  data processing and marketing  which are highly centralized 
kforce is focused on providing staffing services to our clients 
our staffing services include flexible staffing services flex and search services search 
kforce anticipates continued growth which may be organic and or through acquisition of other entities that enhance or expand our existing businesses 
we believe that we are positioned to acquire and integrate other businesses that are strategically beneficial 
acquisitions entail significant risks which are described below 
flex through flex  we provide clients with qualified individuals consultants on a temporary basis with the appropriate skills and experience  when it is determined it is the right match 
to be successful  our employees associates endeavor to understand the clients needs  determine and understand the capabilities of the consultants being recruited  and deliver and manage the client consultant relationship to the satisfaction of both the clients and the consultants 
typically  the better job kforce and our consultants do  the longer the assignments last and the more often those clients turn to kforce for additional needs 
the flex business comprised of our revenues for the year ended december  flex revenues are driven by hours billed and billing rates 
flex gross profit is determined by deducting consultant pay  benefits and other related costs from flex revenues 
flex associate commissions  related taxes and other compensation and benefits as well as field management compensation are included in selling  general and administrative expenses sga along with administrative and corporate employee compensation 
the flex business model involves attempting to maximize consultant hours and billing rates  while optimizing consultant pay rates and benefit costs and commissions and other compensation and benefits for associates  as well as minimizing operating costs necessary to effectively support such activities 
search the search business is a smaller  yet important part of our business that involves locating permanent employees for our clients 
we primarily perform searches on a contingency basis  with fees being earned only if personnel are hired by our clients 
fees are typically structured as a percentage of the placed individual s first year annual compensation 
we recruit permanent employees from our flex consultant population  from internet job boards  and from candidates we identify who are currently employed and not actively seeking another position 
sometimes consultants initially work with clients on a flex basis and then later are converted into permanent employees  for which we also receive search fees 
there can be no assurance or expectation that search revenues will increase if economic conditions improve  as has been the case in previous economic cycles 
clients and recruits are often targets for both flex and search services  and this common focus contributes to our objective of providing integrated solutions for all of our clients human capital needs 

table of contents search revenues are driven by placements made and the rates billed 
there are no consultant payroll costs associated with the placement and thus all search revenue generally increases gross profit by a like amount 
search associate commissions  compensation and benefits are also included in sga 
search revenues comprised of revenue in our industry we serve fortune companies  as well as small and mid size local and regional companies  with our top ten clients representing approximately of revenues for the year ended december  the specialty staffing industry is made up of thousands of companies  most of which are small local firms providing a limited service offering to a small local client base 
we believe kforce is one of the ten largest specialty staffing firms in the united states  that the ten firms combined have a market share of less than of the applicable market and that no single firm has a larger than market share 
competition in a particular market can come from many different companies  either large or small 
we believe  however  that our geographic presence  diversified service offerings within our core businesses  and focus on consistent sales and delivery that is highly disciplined  provide a competitive advantage particularly with larger clients that have operations in multiple markets 
the staffing industry experienced declining revenues for the three years ending in selected industry reports indicate the united states temporary staffing industry has shown revenue levels of billion in  billion in and billion in while no predictions can or should be made about the general economy  the staffing industry as a whole  or specialty staffing in particular  we believe that a sustained economic recovery will stimulate demand for substantial additional us workers or  conversely  to contract with an economic slowdown and that flex demand generally increases before demand for permanent placements increases 
we also believe that our three areas of focus  tech  fa and hls  will be among the higher growth categories in both the short and long term and that over the long term  temporary staffing will become a higher percentage of total jobs  particularly in the professional and technical areas 
further  we believe that the recent positive trends in our operating results  which we believe are enhanced by the streamlining of our operations and centralizing of certain support functions during the economic downturn of  demonstrate a strong positioning for success 
in addition  the national association of temporary and staffing services estimated that more than of all us businesses now utilize temporary staffing services 
there can be no assurance that customer demand for kforce s specialty staffing sectors will return to previous levels or that pricing will return to historical levels 
in addition  kforce has a number of competitors that are increasingly utilizing a lower priced staffing preferred vendor model 
also  competition for skilled candidates  such as finance and accounting candidates  has increased 
each of these factors  among others  may impact the future growth and profitability of kforce 
acquisition of hall  kinion associates  inc on june   kforce acquired of the outstanding common stock of hall  kinion and associates inc hall kinion and its subsidiaries in exchange for approximately million shares of kforce stock 
this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method 
hall kinion s first quarter and full year revenues were million and million  respectively 
the results of hall kinion s operations since the date of acquisition have been included in kforce s consolidated financial statements 
hall kinion specialized in providing technology and finance and accounting related talent on a temporary and permanent basis to its customers primarily in the united states 
the results of the technology and finance and accounting businesses previously provided by hall kinion s onstaff group are included in kforce s technology and finance and accounting business segments  respectively 
as a result of this acquisition  kforce expanded its market presence by adding offices  not including offices that have been consolidated with existing kforce offices 
the acquisition also expanded kforce s service offerings in technology and finance and accounting in certain market segments 
we believe the integration of the operations of hall kinion into kforce is substantially complete and has had a positive effect on revenues  net income and earnings per share beginning in the third quarter of we have not compiled separate results for the former hall kinion operations because these operations have been fully integrated into kforce and it is not feasible to track their results 

table of contents details of the terms of the acquisition are included in a registration statement on form s that we filed on december   and amended on february   april   may  and may  acquisition of vistarms  inc on february   kforce completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of vistarms  inc vista  a privately held company based in herndon  virginia  in exchange for million shares of kforce common stock 
vista has produced revenue of approximately million in technology staffing over the last months with approximately of that revenue in the federal government sector 
because the closing occurred in  none of vista s results of operations have been included in kforce s consolidated financial statements as of december  kforce anticipates continued growth which may be organic and or through acquisition of other entities that enhance or expand our existing businesses 
we believe that we are positioned to acquire and integrate other businesses that are strategically beneficial 
business strategy kforce is a national provider of professional and technical specialty staffing services 
key elements of our business strategy include the following focus on value added services 
we focus on providing specialty staffing services to our clients  specifically in the areas of technology  finance and accounting and health and life sciences 
we believe  based upon data published by the us bureau of labor statistics and other sources  that future employment growth may be significant in these sectors 
the placement of highly skilled personnel requires operational and technical knowledge to effectively recruit and screen personnel  match them to client needs  and develop and manage the resulting relationships 
we believe our historical focus in these markets  combined with our staff s operating expertise  provides us with a competitive advantage 
build long term  consultative relationships 
we believe we have developed long term relationships with our clients by providing solutions to their specialty staffing requirements 
we strive to differentiate ourselves by working closely with our clients to maximize their return on human assets 
in addition  kforce s ability to offer flexible staffing services  coupled with its permanent placement capability  offers the client a multi faceted provider of specialty staffing services 
we believe this ability enables kforce to emphasize consultative rather than just transactional client relationships 
achieve extensive client penetration 
our client development process focuses on contacts with client employees responsible for staffing decisions 
contacts are made within numerous functional departments and at many different organizational levels within the client 
our associates are trained to develop a thorough understanding of each client s total staffing requirements 
recruit high quality consultants 
we place great emphasis on recruiting qualified consultants 
we believe we have a recruiting advantage over those of our competitors that lack the ability to offer candidates flexible and permanent opportunities 
we frequently place candidates seeking permanent employment in flexible assignments until a permanent position becomes available as well as convert temporary candidates into permanent employees of our client companies 
encourage employee achievement 
we promote a quality focused  results oriented culture 
our field associates and corporate personnel are given incentives to encourage the achievement of kforce s corporate goals 
business segments reporting units kforce provides staffing services in three business segments technology 
the bureau of labor statistics lists computer and data processing services among the fastest growing industries over the last decade 
the shortage of technical expertise to operate the advanced systems that businesses have acquired over the last decade is a major catalyst contributing to the growth of this segment 
our technology services focus primarily on more sophisticated areas of information technologies ie  systems applications programmers  systems analysts  and e business and networking technicians 
the economic slowdown of significantly affected the willingness and ability of companies to commit capital resources to their technology systems infrastructure 
while our technology staffing revenue increased throughout  and we believe that the long term business catalysts of technology remain in place  there can be no assurance that spending in the sector will return to the levels seen over the last decade 

table of contents finance and accounting 
our finance and accounting personnel provide both temporary staffing and search placement services to our clients in areas such as taxation  budget preparation and analysis  financial reporting  cost analysis  accounts payable  accounts receivable  professional administrative  credit and collections  general accounting  audit services and systems and controls analysis and documentation to support compliance work under section of the sarbanes oxley act of we believe we have built a reputation for providing qualified finance and accounting professionals to businesses 
historically  this business segment typically experiences its strongest demand in the months preceding and subsequent to the end of the calendar year as the result of increased demand for finance professionals to work on year end closing and tax related assignments 
during the recent economic slowdown  finance and accounting revenues decreased significantly from while these areas improved in  there can be no assurance that revenue in the finance and accounting sector will return to prior peak levels 
health and life sciences 
this segment consists of skilled professionals and technical services in the clinical research  health care and scientific fields 
examples of positions in these categories are clinical research associates cras for the pharmaceutical industry  and health care information management professionals and nurses for hospitals 
the scientific specialty group supplies laboratory  research and development  quality assurance and quality control professionals to a variety of industries 
this segment  and in particular the clinical research and scientific businesses  exhibits decreases in demand the final two weeks of the year as the result of holiday shutdowns at many large clients 
in january  kforce realigned the organizational structure in its finance and accounting and technology business units by aligning them along regional market lines eastern  central and western markets 
kforce believes this operational alignment will develop a more customer centric organization  leverage our best leaders  leverage client relationships across functional offerings and streamline the organization by placing senior management closer to the customer as well as achieve greater cost efficiency 
the health and life sciences segment is organized and managed by specialty because of the unique operating characteristics of each business 
we have continued to supplement our key business segments and divest non core businesses 
in the fourth quarter of  we exited our human resources business  whose operating results are included in the technology business segment 
the human resource business had million of revenue in in realigning our operations we believe we have strengthened our focus on our core specialty staffing business 
financial information regarding our business segments is included in item of part ii 
staffing services staffing services are provided to our clients based on an analysis of each client s individual functional needs  including a determination of time duration of services required 
kforce offers staffing services in two categories flexible staffing services and search services 
in  flexible staffing and search services accounted for and of revenue  respectively 
flexible staffing services kforce offers flexible staffing services  providing personnel in the fields of information technology  finance and accounting  and health and life sciences 
flexible staffing services entail placing skilled workers in the client environment on a contractual basis 
assignments typically run from three months to one year in duration 
we currently offer flexible staffing services in most large metropolitan market areas 
search services kforce provides search services permanent placement for professional and technical personnel in the areas of information technology  finance and accounting  financial services  clinical research  health care and scientific 
kforce primarily performs contingency searches 
a contingency search results in revenue to kforce only when personnel are hired by a client 
our strategy is to perform contingency searches primarily in our core businesses 
fees are typically structured as a percentage of the placed individual s first year annual compensation 
sometimes consultants initially work with clients on a flex basis and then later are converted into permanent employees  for which we also receive search fees 
client searches that are outside a core business area are typically restricted to management or executive level positions and require a targeted research and recruiting effort 
kforce typically performs these searches as retained searches where the client pays a part of the search fee in advance and the remainder upon completion of the search 
retained searches represent only a nominal portion of our search services 

table of contents an active database of candidates is maintained as the result of our continuous recruiting efforts and reputation in the industry 
in addition  many candidates are located as a result of referrals from flexible staffing services activities 
the clients targeted for search services are typically the same as those targeted for flexible staffing services 
this common focus is intended to contribute to kforce s objective of providing an integrated solution for our clients personnel needs 
search services have been severely impacted by the economic downturn and continued to deteriorate in although we have seen some recovery in  there can be no assurance or expectation that search services revenues will return to prior levels 
technology our focus for kforce s technology activities is to improve efficiency and maintain a leveragable platform 
in  we continued to consolidate key technology activities to improve access to data and improve operating leverage 
we completed a field server consolidation project which consolidated over microsoft exchange e mail calendaring servers in the field into one centralized exchange system in our data center located in tampa 
we also completed the acquisition of hall kinion in june we believe that we successfully integrated hall kinion s technical processes into kforce processes and established a methodology for technical acquisition of future companies 
kforce s nationwide computer  telephony and data communications infrastructure was upgraded in to take advantage of faster and lower cost devices and services 
we believe that these projects improved internal communications and should reduce associated costs 
in  we changed our outsourced data center host 
total costs incurred to change vendors were approximately million  including a million cancellation fee 
the change has provided cost savings of million annually in each of the last three years 
kforce also implemented an enterprise wide project management process that we believe has greatly enhanced our ability to plan  implement and align information technology initiatives 
while we believe our technology systems are adequate to meet our current needs  there can be no assurance that they will not be subject to system outages or data loss caused by natural or man made disaster 
in addition  kforce depends on certain third party vendors whose reliability we can not guarantee going forward 
one or more of such events could negatively impact our ability to conduct our normal course of business 
tradenames the kforce and onstaff tradenames  which are registered with the united states patent and trademark office  are important to our business 
competition the specialty staffing services industry is very competitive and fragmented 
there are relatively few barriers to entry and new competitors frequently enter the market 
a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we possess 
we face substantial competition from large national firms and local specialty staffing firms 
the local firms are typically operator owned  and each market generally has one or more significant competitors 
we also face competition from national clerical and light industrial staffing firms and national and regional accounting firms that also offer certain specialty staffing services 
in addition  many companies utilize vendor management systems vms for the purchase of staffing services 
generally  vms are software systems that allow companies to manage service providers 
according to a recent survey conducted by staffing industry analysts  of the fortune have vms installed  up from a year ago  with another planning to do so within the next two years 
typically  vms providers charge staffing firms to of total service revenues  which are usually recorded by staffing firms as a cost of services  thereby compressing margins 
in the united states  approximately national competitors operate  and more than  smaller organizations compete in varying degrees at local levels 
several similar companies global  national  and local compete in foreign markets 
in  kforce s largest competitors included adecco  sa  manpower  inc  mps group  inc  robert half international inc  spherion corporation  ciber resources connection  jefferson wells and cdi corporation 

table of contents kforce believes that availability and quality of personnel  level of service  effective monitoring of job performance  scope of geographic service and price of service are the principal elements of competition in our industry 
we believe that availability of quality personnel is especially important 
in order to attract candidates  we place emphasis upon our ability to provide permanent placement opportunities  competitive compensation and benefits  quality and varied assignments and scheduling flexibility 
because personnel pursue other employment opportunities on a regular basis  it is important that we respond to market conditions affecting these individuals 
additionally  in certain markets and in response to economic softening  we have experienced significant pricing pressure from some of our competitors 
although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors  we expect competition and pricing pressure to continue  and there can be no assurance that we will remain competitive 
insurance kforce maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability  automobile liability and employers liability each with excess liability coverage 
we also maintain workers compensation  fidelity  fiduciary  directors and officers  professional liability  and employment practices liability policies 
these policies provide coverage subject to their terms  conditions  limits of liability  and deductibles  for certain liabilities that may arise from kforce s operations 
there can be no assurance that any of the above coverage will be adequate for our needs  or that we will maintain all such policies in the future 
financial information about foreign and domestic operations materially all of kforce s revenues are derived from domestic operations with customers located in the united states  for the years ended december   and operating employees and personnel as of december   kforce employed  operating employees and had approximately  consultants on assignment flexible consultants providing flexible staffing services to our clients 
flexible consultants are primarily individuals who are employed directly by kforce flexible employees representing of flexible consultants  the balance are individuals who are employed by other entities independent contractors that provide their employees to kforce for assignment to its clients 
as the employer  kforce is responsible for the operating employees and flexible employees payrolls and the employer s share of applicable social security taxes fica  federal and state unemployment taxes  workers compensation insurance  and other direct labor costs relating to our employees 
we offer access to various health  life and disability insurance programs and other benefits for operating employees and flexible employees 
we have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our operating employees or flexible employees  have never experienced any material labor disruption  and are unaware of any current efforts or plans to organize any of our employees 
available information we make available  free of charge  through the investor relations page on our website  and by responding to requests addressed to our vice president investor relations  our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and all amendments to those reports

the information contained on our website  or on other websites linked to our website  is not part of this document 
risk factors kforce may not be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
kforce depends upon the abilities of its staff to attract and retain personnel  particularly technical and professional personnel  who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our clients 
we must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies 
we expect competition for individuals with proven technical or professional skills for the foreseeable future 
if qualified personnel are not available to us in sufficient numbers and upon economic terms acceptable to us  it could have a material detrimental effect on our business 

table of contents kforce s current market share may decrease as a result of limited barriers to entry for new competitors and discontinuation of clients outsourcing of their staffing needs 
kforce faces significant competition in the markets we serve  and there are limited barriers to entry for new competitors 
the competition among staffing services firms is intense 
kforce competes for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services  systems integrators  computer systems consultants  temporary personnel agencies  search firms and other providers of staffing services 
a number of our competitors possess substantially greater resources than we do 
from time to time we experience significant pressure from our clients to reduce price levels 
during these periods  we may face increased competitive pricing pressures and may not be able to recruit the personnel necessary to fill our clients needs 
we also face the risk that certain of our current and prospective clients will decide to provide similar services internally 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully compete 
we rely on short term contracts with most of our clients 
because long term contracts are not a significant part of our business  future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 
further  our reliance on short term contracts exerts continued pressure on us when we try to renew contracts with existing clients who may seek better terms at each renewal 
we do not provide an offshore outsourcing solution 
many staffing customers are now seeking an offshore solution to support their technology and business process function and  as a result  a significant amount of technology and financial staffing may be replaced by offshore resources 
we do not currently provide an offshore program and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against the offshore solution providers or that we will not lose significant market share and revenue 
while our technology staffing revenue increased through  and we believe that the long term business catalyst of technology remain in place  there can be no assurance that spending in the sector will return to the levels seen over the last decade 
we do not provide a vendor management system vms solution 
many staffing customers are seeking to consolidate their use of staffing services through the use of vms solutions 
kforce provides consultants to these clients through other staffing companies who utilize a vms solution  but does not currently provide this service directly to its clients 
there can be no assurance that we can continue to effectively compete with those companies that provide a vms solution 
currently  kforce is unable to recruit enough nurses to meet our clients demands for nurse staffing services  limiting the potential growth of our healthcare staffing business 
kforce relies on its ability to attract  develop  and retain nurses and other healthcare personnel who possess the skills  experience and licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our healthcare staffing clients 
we compete for healthcare staffing personnel with other temporary healthcare staffing companies  as well as actual and potential clients 
currently  there is a shortage of qualified nurses in most areas of the united states and competition for nursing personnel is increasing 
at this time  we do not have enough nurses to meet our clients demands for our nurse staffing services 
this shortage of nurses limits kforce s ability to grow our healthcare staffing business 
furthermore  we believe that the aging of the existing nurse population and declining enrollments in nursing schools will result in further competition for qualified nursing personnel 
decreases in patient occupancy at healthcare clients facilities may adversely affect the profitability of kforce s business 
demand for temporary healthcare staffing services is significantly affected by the general level of patient occupancy at healthcare clients facilities 
when a hospital s occupancy increases  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as occupancy decreases  clients may reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees 
kforce may also experience more competitive pricing pressure during periods of occupancy downturn 
this reduction in occupancy could adversely affect the demand for services and kforce s profitability 
there has been a significantly lessened demand for our healthcare staffing services in recent years 
there can be no assurance that such demand will remain at current or return to prior levels 

table of contents significant legal actions  particularly relating to our healthcare staffing services  could subject kforce to substantial uninsured liabilities 
in recent years  healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice  product liability or related legal theories 
many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs 
in addition  we may be subject to claims related to torts or crimes committed by our employees or temporary staffing personnel 
in some instances  we are required to indemnify clients against some or all of these risks 
a failure of any of our employees or personnel to observe our policies and guidelines intended to reduce these risks  relevant client policies and guidelines or applicable federal  state or local laws  rules and regulations could result in negative publicity  payment of fines or other damages 
to protect ourselves from the cost of these claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance  fidelity insurance and general liability insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations 
our insurance coverage  however  may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost 
if we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage  we may be exposed to substantial liabilities 
the addition of offices and entry into new geographic markets may not occur on a timely basis or achieve anticipated financial results 
kforce s growth depends in part on our ability to enter new vertical or geographic markets successfully 
this expansion is dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to develop  recruit and maintain a base of qualified professionals within a new geographic market  initiate  develop and sustain corporate client relationships in each new vertical or geographic market  attract  hire  integrate and retain qualified sales and sales support employees  and accurately assess the demand of a new market 
the addition of new offices and entry into new vertical or geographic markets typically result in increases in operating expenses  primarily due to increased employee headcount 
expenses are incurred in advance of forecasted revenue  and there is typically a delay before our new employees reach full productivity 
additionally  demand for our services in new markets that we enter might also be less than we anticipate 
if we are unable to enter new vertical or geographic markets in a cost effective manner or if demand for our services in new markets does not meet or exceed our forecasts  our business  operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
in  and  we closed and consolidated offices to improve efficiency  and further closures or consolidation may occur depending on market and competitive conditions 
competition for acquisition opportunities may restrict kforce s future growth by limiting our ability to make acquisitions at reasonable valuations 
kforce s business strategy includes increasing market share and presence in the staffing industry through strategic acquisitions of companies that complement or enhance our business 
we have historically faced competition for acquisitions 
in the future  this could limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly non accretive to us 
in addition  kforce may be limited by its ability to obtain financing to consummate desirable acquisitions 
kforce may face difficulties integrating acquisitions into existing operations and acquisitions may be unsuccessful  involve significant cash expenditures or expose kforce to unforeseen liabilities 
kforce continually evaluates opportunities to acquire staffing companies that complement or enhance our business and frequently has preliminary acquisition discussions with some of these companies 
these acquisitions involve numerous risks  including potential loss of key employees or clients of acquired companies  difficulties integrating acquired personnel and distinct cultures into a single business  diversion of management attention from existing operations  and assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies 

table of contents these acquisitions may also involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence  integration expenses and exposure to unforeseen liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business and financial condition 
kforce faces significant employment liability risk 
kforce employs and places people in the workplaces of other businesses 
an inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of errors and omissions  misuse of client proprietary information  misappropriation of funds  discrimination and harassment  employment of illegal aliens  theft of client property  other criminal activity  torts or other claims 
we have policies and guidelines in place to reduce our exposure to such risks 
however  failure of any employee or personnel to follow these policies and guidelines may result in negative publicity  injunctive relief  payment by kforce of monetary damages or fines or other material adverse effects upon our business 
moreover  we could be held responsible for the actions at a workplace of persons not under our immediate control 
to reduce our exposure  we maintain insurance covering general liability  workers compensation claims  errors and omissions  and employee theft 
due to the nature of our assignments  in particular  access to client information systems and confidential information  and the potential liability with respect thereto  we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts adequate to cover any such liability on acceptable terms 
in addition  we face various employment related risks not covered by insurance  such as wage and hour laws and employment tax responsibility 
kforce may be adversely affected by government regulation of the staffing business 
our business is subject to regulation and licensing in many states 
while we have had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material 
if we fail to comply  such failure could materially adversely affect kforce s financial results 
there are proposed changes in government visa rules that may materially impact our ability to bring foreign born nurses to the united states 
our ability to bring nurses into the united states in the future may be severely impacted  which would affect our nurse staffing revenue 
kforce may be adversely affected by government regulation of the workplace 
part of our business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients workplaces 
increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer employee relationship could have a material adverse affect on kforce 
if kforce becomes subject to material liabilities under our self insured programs  our financial results may be adversely affected 
kforce provides workers compensation coverage through a program that is partially self insured 
in addition  we provide medical coverage to our employees through a partially self insured preferred provider organization 
if we become subject to substantial uninsured workers compensation or medical coverage liabilities  our financial results may be adversely affected 
future changes in reimbursement trends could hamper our clients ability to pay kforce 
many of kforce s healthcare clients are reimbursed under the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs for the services they provide 
in recent years  federal and state governments have made significant changes in these programs that have reduced government rates 
in addition  insurance companies and managed care organizations seek to control costs by requiring that healthcare providers  such as hospitals  discount their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans 
future federal and state legislation or evolving commercial reimbursement trends may further reduce  or change conditions for  our clients reimbursement 
limitations on reimbursement could reduce our clients cash flow  hampering their ability to pay us 
this situation could have a significant impact on our cash flow 
significant increases in payroll related costs could adversely affect kforce s business 
kforce is required to pay a number of federal  state  and local payroll and related costs  including unemployment taxes  workers compensation and insurance  fica  and medicare  among others  for our employees 
significant increases in the effective rates of any payroll related costs likely would have a material adverse effect upon kforce 
costs could also increase as a result of health care reforms or the possible imposition of additional 
table of contents requirements and restrictions related to the placement of personnel 
recent federal and state legislative proposals have included provisions extending health insurance benefits to personnel who currently do not receive such benefits 
we may not be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs  if any such proposals are adopted 
kforce depends on the proper functioning of our information systems 
kforce is dependent on the proper functioning of information systems in operating its business 
critical information systems are used in every aspect of kforce s daily operations  most significantly  in the identification and matching of staffing resources to client assignments and in the customer billing and consultant payment functions 
kforce s information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards including the use of a third party data processing center 
however  kforce and its systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters  fire  terrorist acts  power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins  computer viruses and similar events 
if our critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable  we would have to accomplish these functions manually  which could temporarily impact our ability to identify business opportunities quickly  to maintain billing and clinical records reliably  and to bill for services efficiently 
in addition  we depend on third party vendors for certain functions whose future performance and reliability we can not warranty 
due to inherent limitations  there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors and fraud  or in making all material information known in a timely manner to management 
our management  including our ceo and cfo  does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within kforce have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the control 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  over time  a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
kforce may not be able to maintain sufficient cash flow or borrowing capacity to support operations 
kforce s liquidity may be adversely impacted by covenants in our credit facility 
on november   kforce entered into a million amended and restated credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by bank of america the credit facility 
on december   kforce amended certain terms and conditions of the credit facility  and extended its term to november  the credit facility provides for a maximum revolving credit facility of million 
kforce is currently reviewing alternatives with regard to renewing or refinancing the credit facility 
kforce may not be able to renew the credit facility at the same terms and conditions as the existing credit facility 
the terms of the credit facility include certain financial covenants to which kforce is subject  including a requirement to maintain at least million of borrowing availability 
in addition  should the amount available to be borrowed be less than million but greater than million kforce must attain certain ebitda targets 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under this credit facility with an additional million of borrowing available  without triggering the financial covenants and million in total availability 
at no time during the existence of the credit facility have we ever triggered such covenants 
if such financial covenants were triggered in the future and if we did not comply with them  such a breach of the credit facility could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
such lack of compliance could result  among other things  in the acceleration of all amounts borrowed under the credit facility

success also depends upon our ability to identify  develop  and retain qualified operating employees  particularly management  client servicing  and candidate recruiting employees 
kforce expends significant resources in the recruiting and training of its employees  as the pool of available applicants for these positions is limited

kforce s stock price may be volatile 
kforce s common stock is traded on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol kfrc 
the market price of our stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including our operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  the employment services industry  or other developments affecting us  our clients  or our competitors  some of which may be unrelated to our performance 
in addition  the stock market in general  especially the nasdaq national market tier  along with market prices for staffing companies  has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
among other things  volatility in our stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices that they pay 
the volatility also could impair our ability in the future to offer common stock as a source of additional capital or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses 
provisions in kforce s articles and bylaws and under florida law may have certain anti takeover effects 
kforce s articles of incorporation and bylaws and florida law contain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
in particular  our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board of directors and permit the removal of directors only for cause 
additionally  management may issue up to million shares of preferred stock  and fix the rights and preferences thereof  without a further vote of the shareholders 
in addition  certain of our officers and managers have employment agreements containing certain provisions that call for substantial payments to be made to such employees in certain circumstances upon a change in control 
certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of kforce  including an acquisition in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as a result  shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so
