item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  which appear in item of this report 
in this discussion and analysis  we explain our financial condition and results of operations 
we have organized our discussion and analysis as follows first  we briefly summarize the impact of the sales of our mobile and wireless data businesses on our operating results and our financial condition 
we then discuss a number of aspects of our financial results that make it difficult to compare results from one year to the next 
we then discuss our critical accounting policies 
we then discuss the results of our continuing operations for the year ended december   compared with results for and next  we review our financial condition addressing our sources and uses of cash  liquidity and capital resources and contractual obligations 
we conclude with a description of risks associated with our business 
introduction and overview sales of mobile and wireless data businesses we own and manage a portfolio of mortgage backed securities and other short term government agency investments 
these investments and our strategy for managing this business are discussed in detail above in item under the heading introduction 
in  we sold our mobile and wireless data businesses  which had not been profitable historically  and we substantially reduced our operating losses and overall cash consumption 
during the fourth quarter of  we substantially completed our obligations under certain transition services agreements with the purchasers of our transportation and mobile government businesses and began to focus primarily on our mortgage backed securities business 
we also further reduced staffing levels and reduced ongoing operating expenses 
because of certain costs related to the sales of our transportation and mobile government businesses and the implementation of our new business strategy  however  overall fourth quarter operating expenses in were higher than we expect them to be in future quarters 
in connection with our business transition  during the fourth quarter we reduced the size of our corporate staff significantly and currently have a staff of eight employees 
in addition  we have relocated our corporate offices to a smaller leased facility in baltimore  maryland 
this new location will become our sole operating location 
all other existing leases except for the lease in massachusetts that we have sublet to the buyer of our mobile government business expire during the first quarter of going forward  we expect our general and administrative expenses to be significantly lower  although we will still incur costs associated with being a public company  including insurance  audit and other outside professional services  compliance and various regulatory fees 
we also will continue to incur fees for our outside investment and financial advisors 
as a result of the sales of our three mobile and wireless data business segments  we have presented the results of the ems  transportation and mobile government segments as discontinued operations 
these three operating segments accounted for all of the operating revenue and a significant portion of the operating expenses that we have previously reported 
consequently  when the results of these segments are presented as discontinued operations  the operating revenues and expenses of our continuing operations are significantly lower than they have been in the past 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we have restated prior periods to reflect the presentation of the transportation and mobile government segments as discontinued operations  so that period to period results are comparable 
we may be subject to continuing liabilities as a result of our sales of our operating business 
under the definitive purchase agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of these businesses for certain breaches of representations and warranties and other covenants that we provided to them with respect to the sales of the businesses 
in addition  we remain fully liable for the operation of each of the business segments prior to the dispositions 
we also have retained liability for certain continuing obligations associated with the mobile government segment  as described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
in addition  as discussed below in item under the heading sales of discontinued operations and in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  we are involved in a dispute with the buyer of our transportation segment about the amount of post closing payments and purchase price adjustments 
to the extent this dispute is not resolved in our favor  we may not receive certain additional payments that we expect and we may be required to make a cash payment to the buyer 
in such event  we would record a charge against earnings  further increasing the loss on the sale of the transportation segment 
with the transition from our mobile and wireless data businesses to our mbs business  we will no longer report revenue  cost of revenue or gross profit 
instead  we expect that our income statement will consist primarily of interest income and expense  realized and unrealized gains on transactions and selling  general and administrative expenses 
our balance sheet now includes or as we develop our mbs business  is expected to include primarily cash and cash equivalents  investments  repurchase agreements to the extent we borrow funds to leverage our mbs portfolio  interest receivable and payable and other less significant assets and liabilities  including the fair value of derivative instruments 
to the extent that we enter additional or different businesses in the future  the results of our operations and the composition of our assets and liabilities could again change materially 
other factors affecting comparability of results of operations certain items included in our results of operations have varied significantly from one year to the next  making it difficult to compare our overall results from year to year 
these items are discussed below 
in general  as discussed below  we do not expect these items to have a material impact on our results of operations in future years 
impairment charges sfas no 
impairments through december   we recorded approximately billion in goodwill and other intangibles in discontinued operations related to acquisitions of mobile and wireless data businesses 
during  we performed on going analysis of the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles and the value of our investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
based on quantitative and qualitative measures  we assessed the need to record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when impairment indicators were present 
based on a variety of indicators  we determined during that the goodwill and other intangibles from our acquisitions may have become impaired 
as a result of our review  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill and certain other assets related to our acquisitions were not fully recoverable 
accordingly  during  we recorded impairment charges in continuing operations of approximately million  which represented the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the assets 
also during  we recorded impairment charges in discontinued operations of approximately billion  which represented the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the goodwill  intangible and other assets 
these amounts are included in the loss from discontinued operations 
goodwill we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
instead  they are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded an impairment charge of million million to goodwill and million to intangible assets related to discontinued operations 
sfas no 
also requires that we repeat the impairment analysis each year  beginning with a recurring annual measurement date chosen by us in we chose september  to be s measurement date  and we continued to perform annual impairment reviews as of september th each subsequent year 
the september  review resulted in an additional impairment charge to goodwill of million 
all of these amounts are included in loss from discontinued operations 
we performed this analysis again in september and determined that there was no further impairment of goodwill at that time 
during the second quarter of  with the potential future sale of the transportation and mobile government segments  we reassessed the value of the transportation and mobile government goodwill and recorded impairment charges related to goodwill of million and million  respectively 
after the sale of the ems  transportation and mobile government segments  we no longer have any goodwill on our balance sheet 
therefore  sfas no 
and goodwill impairment charges will not be relevant to future results 
see notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
intangibles and other long lived assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
also changes the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale  and broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  during  we recorded an impairment charge to intangibles and other long lived assets of million 
of this charge  million related to continuing operations and million  million and  related to ems  transportation and mobile government  respectively  which are reported as discontinued operations 
during  we recorded impairment charges to intangibles and other long lived assets of million 
of this charge  million related to continuing operations and  and  related to ems and transportation  respectively  which are reported as discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of  with the potential future sale of the transportation and mobile government segments  we reassessed the value of the transportation and mobile government intangibles and other long lived assets and recorded non cash impairment charges related to transportation intangibles and other assets of million and million  respectively 
after the sale of the ems  transportation and mobile government segments  we no longer have any intangible assets on our balance sheet 
therefore  intangible asset impairment charges will not be relevant to future results 
we will continue to evaluate our other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
see notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
investments from through  we made approximately million of investments in other businesses through our aether capital llc subsidiary 
during  we recorded a net charge of million  which included million in impairment charges related to our investments 
the remainder of the net charge related to net gains and losses from the sales of investments  and changes in the fair value of warrants 
during  we recorded a net charge of million  which included million in impairment charges related to our investments 
the remainder of the charge related to net gains and losses from the sales of investments  and changes in the fair value of warrants 
during  we recorded a net gain of  which included impairment charges of  related to our investments 
the remainder of the net gain resulted from sales of investments 
during  we recorded a net loss of million  which included a million loss on the liquidation of our investments available for sale consisting of highly liquid us government agency sponsored securities 
the loss was partially offset by a gain of million relating to the sale of other investments 
as of december   our investment balances were primarily related to mbs and cash equivalents 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
restructuring charges during through  we implemented expense reduction plans as part of our integration strategy focused on improving operational efficiencies and the implementation of other measures in order to reduce planned expenses 
these efforts have resulted in the consolidation of excess facilities and a significant reduction in our workforce 
as of december   we had a total of employees  and all of them were located at our principal office in baltimore  maryland 
employee separation benefits under the restructuring plans include severance  medical  and other benefits 
facility closure costs and other costs included expected losses on subleases  brokerage commissions  asset impairment charges  contract termination costs and other costs 
charge in thousands continuing operations charge positions eliminated discontinued operations charge positions eliminated facilities closed or consolidated as of december   the accrued liability related to all restructuring activities was  the majority of which related to lease obligations 
restructuring charges in are not expected to be material to our results or financial condition 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies affect the amount of income and expense we record in each period as well as the value of our assets and liabilities and our disclosures regarding contingent assets and liabilities 
in applying these critical accounting policies  we must make estimates and assumptions to prepare our financial statements that  if made differently  could have a positive or negative effect on our financial results 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are both reasonable and appropriate  in light of applicable accounting rules 
however  estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could materially differ from estimates 
management believes that the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies  which the securities and exchange commission defines as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because management must make estimates about uncertain and changing matters 
we discuss these and other significant accounting policies related to our continuing operations in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
mortgage backed securities we invest primarily in agency pass through certificates representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires us to classify our investments as trading investments  available for sale investments or held to maturity investments 
although we generally intend to hold most of our investments until maturity  we may  from time to time  sell any of our investments as part of our overall management of our statement of financial condition 
accordingly  this flexibility requires us to classify all of our mortgage backed securities as available for sale 
all assets classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  based on market pricing estimates provided by independent pricing services and dealers who make markets in these financial instruments  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses on mortgage backed securities that are considered other than temporary  as measured by the amount of decline in fair value attributable to factors other than temporary  are recognized in income and the cost basis of the securities is adjusted 
as of december   we had two mbs in an aggregate unrealized loss position of  because changes in interest rates have reduced their market value 
the securities carry an implied aaa rating 
we do not consider these unrealized losses other than temporary since we have the ability and the intent to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a market price recovery 
interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the securities are amortized into interest income over the lives of the securities using the interest method in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  street consensus prepayment speeds  and current market conditions 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our mbs increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing our net yield on mbs 
if we used different prepayment estimates  the amounts we report for interest income could be materially different 
mbs transactions are recorded on the trade date 
purchases of newly issued securities are recorded when all significant uncertainties regarding the characteristics of the securities are removed  generally shortly before settlement date 
realized gains and losses on such transactions are determined on the specific identification basis 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of the mbs we held at december  valuation of deferred tax assets we have deferred tax assets as a result of years of accumulated tax loss carryforwards 
management believes we will achieve profitable operations in future years that will enable us to recover the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
however  we presently do not have sufficient objective evidence to support management s belief and  accordingly  we maintain a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
when we have sufficient objective evidence  we will reduce our valuation allowance accordingly 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
guarantees we have certain guarantees related to assigned leases 
we also agreed to maintain a letter of credit as collateral assurance of performance for a significant customer contract that was assigned to the buyer of our mobile government business in connection with the sale of that business 
these arrangements have been evaluated in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  and we have recorded a total liability of  in respect to these arrangements 
this liability is included in other long term liabilities on our balance sheet 
the liability was recorded based on various scenarios that could result in potential liabilities from the guarantee ranging from to million and the estimated probability of those scenarios based on discussions with personnel closely involved with the project 
had we used different estimates  the liability that we recorded could have differed materially 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 titled share based payments statement no 
r 
statement no 
r requires that share based payments  such as grants of stock options  restricted shares  and stock appreciation rights  be measured at fair value and reported as expense in a company s financial statements over the requisite service period 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of this subject 
results of continuing operations overview because we began implementing our mbs strategy in  and because we have only invested a limited amount of cash in mbs  in response to market conditions and the advice of our outside financial and investment advisors  the results of our operations in and prior years are not indicative of what we expect our results to be in the future 
most significantly  our operating expenses though they have declined significantly are still higher than they will be  and we have realized only limited interest income from our mbs portfolio reflecting limited mbs investment for only a portion of and our decision not to expand the portfolio in through the use of leverage 
the most notable trend in our operating results is the decline in both expenses and operating loss 
from to  our business saw the benefits of our organizational restructuring efforts  which significantly reduced our operating expenses 
in  we also repurchased a portion of our convertible subordinated notes at a discount 
this not only produced a significant one time gain which reduced our loss from continuing operations  but also substantially reduced our interest expense going forward 
from to  our business continued to benefit from our organizational restructuring activities 
our operating loss continued to decline as a result of the decline in our expenses 
in october  we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding convertible subordinated notes at a price of and realized a million loss on the early extinguishment 
the loss  however  was offset by lower interest expense as a result of the redemption 
if we had not redeemed these notes  we would have been required to pay million of interest on the notes through their maturity in march interest income from mbs portfolio during the second quarter of  we began implementing an mbs strategy and invested a portion of our cash resources into an mbs portfolio 
initially  our board of directors authorized the use of up to million for the mbs strategy 
this limit was later increased to million 
initially  we entered into forward purchase contracts representing commitments to make future purchases of mortgage backed securities with an estimated face value of million 
as discussed below  we sold our position for a gain in the third quarter of before purchasing the underlying mortgage backed securities 
we then invested approximately million in mbs in september and october of the remainder of our cash allocated to the mbs strategy was invested in short term us government agency sponsored cash equivalents with yields between and 
we consider interest earned on all of these investments to be interest from our mbs portfolio 
during  the interest earned on the portfolio was approximately  net of premium amortization and custodian fees 
in thousands interest earned on mbs less mbs premium amortization interest earned on us government agency sponsored securities less custodian fees interest income from mbs portfolio our interest income from mbs  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums  varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds 
changes in both interest rates and prepayment speeds are uncertain and represent principal risks of our mbs strategy  as discussed below in item under the heading risk factors differences in timing of interest rate adjustments on our acquired securities and on our borrowings may adversely affect our mbs strategy and the returns on the portion of our cash we invest in mbs 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the constant prepayment rate cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our mbs increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on mbs 
the following table presents key metrics of our mbs  for the quarterly periods presented quarter ended weighted average coupon weighted average cpr weighted average yield september  december  we believe that the cpr in future periods will depend  in part  on changes in and the level of market interest rates across the yield curve  with higher cprs expected during periods of declining interest rates and lower cprs expected during periods of rising interest rates 
gain on sale of mbs in late june  we purchased forward option contracts representing commitments to make future purchases of mortgage backed securities with an estimated face value of million 
the purchase commitments appreciated in value during the third quarter of and we sold our position  realizing a cash gain of approximately million 
operating expenses our operating expenses have declined significantly each year from to  primarily due to the results of our restructuring efforts  in which we streamlined our organization and reduced our workforce 
in addition  we have not continued to experience significant impairment charges on our long lived assets  after incurring significant impairment charges in and  to a lesser extent  operating expenses in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation option and warrant expense impairment of other assets other expense restructuring charge total operating expenses we expect our operating expenses to be significantly lower than during the first quarter of we have substantially completed transition activities that related to ongoing obligations to the buyers of our transportation and mobile government segments 
we also have streamlined our corporate infrastructure to the level required to support our ongoing business 
however  we will continue to incur the costs of operating as a publicly traded company  as discussed in more detail below in item under the heading risk factors compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of cash compensation and related costs for general corporate personnel  along with rent and general support costs 
these expenses also include the costs of outside professionals  including legal counsel  accountants and investment bankers 
sg a expenses decreased million  or approximately from to of the decrease  million is primarily due to reductions in personnel costs as a result of our reduction in workforce 
telecommunications costs decreased million 
travel  taxes and facility expenses also decreased approximately   and  respectively 
sg a expenses decreased million  or approximately  from to of the decrease  million is primarily due to reductions in personnel costs as a result of our reduction in workforce 
facility and travel costs decreased approximately  and  respectively 
additional expense reductions were offset somewhat by a million increase in investment banking fees paid in these investment banking fees included  related to the implementation of our mbs strategy  including  paid to our investment advisor fbr investment management for assisting with the development and launch of the mbs strategy  as well as  paid to a third party investment expert to provide our management and our board of directors with an independent assessment of the mbs strategy 
additionally  the investment banking fees included a  advisory fee related to an unconsummated deal to sell our transportation segment 
our sg a expenses include the fees we pay to our investment advisor relative to their advisory services for our mbs portfolio 
these fees include a quarterly management fee equal to of the aggregate cost basis of the portfolio and an incentive fee equal to of the yield in excess of a certain yield threshold 
the management fee will increase as the size of our mbs portfolio increases 
as of december   no incentive fee has been earned on the portfolio 
we expect our sg a expenses to be significantly lower than now that we have completed the sales of our operating segments and the transition of our business 
over time  if we increase our mbs portfolio to a significant size  we may expand our corporate staff to add mbs investment expertise  which would allow us to reduce our reliance on  and the fees we are required to pay to our outside investment advisors 
we have not yet determined at what point  if at all  we would consider it prudent and advisable to expand our corporate staff to add this capability  but we plan to continuously evaluate the cost effectiveness of additional personnel 
depreciation depreciation expenses arise from property and equipment purchased for use in our operations 
depreciation decreased million from to the decrease was primarily a result of the impairment charges recorded during  which significantly reduced the carrying value of our long lived assets 
depreciation decreased approximately  from to the decrease was primarily a result of the impairment charges recorded during and  which significantly reduced the carrying value of our long lived assets  offset somewhat by accelerated depreciation on certain assets taken out of service during during  we identified that portion of our corporate assets that would cease to be used in our ongoing operations after the streamlining of our corporate infrastructure and our move to baltimore 
at that point  we began accelerating the depreciation on those assets based on their shortened useful lives 
as a result  our fixed asset balances at december  primarily include assets that will be used on an ongoing basis and the depreciation on those assets in will be significantly lower than depreciation 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
option and warrant expense option and warrant expense decreased approximately  from to and approximately  from to the decreases in and were primarily the result of the cancellation of options as we reduced our work force 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
impairment of other assets and restructuring charges we have discussed our impairment of other assets and restructuring charges above in the introduction to this item  under the headings impairment charges intangibles and other long lived assets and restructuring  respectively 
other expense other expense was approximately  for and was primarily due to the loss on disposal of our corporate jet  offset somewhat by gains on the disposal of other assets we sold 
other expense for was approximately  and was primarily due to a litigation settlement 
other income expense in thousands interest income from money market accounts interest expense on subordinated notes payable gain loss on early extinguishment of debt equity in losses of investments investment gain loss  including impairments  net total interest income from money market accounts interest income from money market accounts consists primarily of interest from cash equivalents and investments with a maturity of less than months 
interest income from money market accounts decreased approximately million from to and approximately million from to as the result of a decreasing cash and investment balance as we continued to consume cash to fund our business and to repurchase in and later redeem in our convertible subordinated notes  combined with decreased interest rates 
during  we invested a substantial portion of our available cash in our mbs portfolio  and interest on such amounts is reported as interest income from mbs portfolio  as discussed above 
interest expense on subordinated notes payable interest expense on subordinated notes payable consists primarily of debt service on our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
interest expense on subordinated notes payable decreased million from to and million from to  primarily due to a decrease in the outstanding principal amount of the notes as the result of the repurchase of debt in and the redemption of the remaining debt in as of october   all of the outstanding notes were redeemed and no further interest expense will be incurred 
gain loss on early extinguishment of debt during  we realized a gain of million  from repurchasing million of our convertible subordinated notes due march  at a discount to their face amount including accrued interest 
during  we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding notes at a price of and realized a million loss  which consisted of the million premium on the repurchase and the recognition of approximately  in deferred financing costs 
the early retirement of the debt resulted in a savings of million in interest expense on the notes that we would have been required to pay through their maturity in march equity in losses of investments equity in losses of investments consists of our proportionate share of the net losses in our investments over which we exercised significant influence and as such accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
equity in losses of investments decreased to approximately  for from million for the decrease from to reflects a decrease in the number of equity investments in our portfolio in addition to decreased losses from those investments 
there were no equity losses of investments during and we no longer have any investments accounted for under the equity method

sales of discontinued operations ems sale on january   we completed the sale of our ems segment to telecommunication systems  inc tcs 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  as amended  we received million for the ems segment  consisting of million in cash and a note in the principal amount of million due in august we also received  shares of tcs class a common stock valued as of closing at approximately million 
in april  we sold these securities and received approximately million in cash 
in addition  the million note from tcs was repaid in full in august transportation sale on september   we sold our transportation segment to slingshot acquisition corporation slingshot  which is an affiliate of platinum equity capital partners lp  for million in cash 
the purchase price is subject to a post closing adjustment based on net working capital to the extent the transportation segment s adjusted net working capital at august  was more than million or less than million 
in addition  the parties also agreed to net cash receipts and payments by or for the account of the transportation segment between september  and the closing date  with any positive net cash balance being payable to slingshot and any negative balance being due from slingshot 
the transaction was structured as a sale of assets and assumption of certain liabilities 
the assets sold consisted of all of the assets used primarily in the transportation segment 
slingshot assumed responsibility for substantially all post closing liabilities and certain historical liabilities  of the transportation segment 
at the closing of the purchase agreement  we entered into a transition services agreement with slingshot to provide for the orderly transition of the business to slingshot  which is expected to be completed by early in connection with the sale of the transportation segment  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge in the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  both parties advised each other of significant disagreement over both the working capital adjustment and the cash true up 
we advised slingshot that based on our calculation of net working capital  the purchase price should be reduced by approximately  in addition  we advised slingshot that pursuant to the cash true up mechanism  slingshot owed us approximately  slingshot disputed our calculations and contended that its own calculation of working capital supported a downward purchase price adjustment of approximately million and its view of the cash true up arrangement suggested that it should receive a payment from us of approximately  we subsequently responded to slingshot and rejected all of slingshot s calculations and arguments  except that we agreed that the working capital calculation should result in an additional downward price adjustment of approximately  and that amounts owed relative to the cash true up mechanism should be reduced by approximately  we have held discussions with slingshot about the disputed amounts but have not reached agreement on any of them 
while we strongly disagree with slingshot s positions on these matters  if the disagreements cannot be resolved by agreement of the parties  they are required to be submitted under the terms of the asset purchase agreement to an independent accounting firm for final resolution 
at this time  we cannot predict whether the disagreements will be resolved consensually or what the results of any decision by an independent accounting firm are likely to be 
as of december   we had  in amounts due from slingshot recorded on our balance sheet as prepaid expenses and other assets 
if we are not successful in collecting this amount  we will have to write off these assets with a future period charge to earnings 
in addition  if we do not prevail in our view of the appropriate working capital adjustment  we could be required to make a cash payment to slingshot in the amount of the working capital shortfall which would also result in a future period charge to earnings 
mobile government sale on september   we sold our mobile government segment to bio key international inc bio key for million in cash 
the purchase price is subject to a post closing adjustment based upon net working capital 
the transaction was structured as a sale of asset and assumption of certain liabilities 
the assets sold consisted of all the assets used in the mobile government segment 
bio key assumed responsibility for substantially all post closing liabilities  and certain historical liabilities  of the mobile government segment 
we also entered into a transition services agreement with bio key to provide for the orderly transition of the business to bio key  which is expected to be completed by early in connection with the sale of the mobile government segment  we recorded an million non cash impairment charge in the second quarter of on october   we informed bio key that based on our calculation of net working capital  the purchase price should be increased by approximately  during the fourth quarter of  bio key paid us for the working capital adjustment and substantially all other amounts due related to the sale 
financial condition introduction in reviewing the discussion of our financial condition that follows  you should consider the following our business has never generated a profit 
consequently  we have required funding from sources other than our business operations to run our business 
this funding has come principally from selling debt and equity securities 
we do not currently have a bank line of credit or other bank borrowing facility  although we expect that we will be able to borrow money to expand our mbs portfolio through the use of repurchase agreements  as discussed above in item under the heading business introduction mortgage backed securities strategy 
at december   we had cash balances and liquid investments including our investments in mbs and other us government agency sponsored securities of approximately million excluding million of restricted cash 
this represents approximately of the total assets on our balance sheet at december  we have various obligations that we are required to pay over time under various contracts and agreements  as discussed in more detail below 
our total balance sheet liabilities at december  were approximately million 
since our inception in  we have accumulated substantial net operating and capital losses that we are allowed to carry forward for a period of time to offset future taxable income 
these tax loss carryforwards would be a valuable asset if we become profitable in the future and start to generate income that would otherwise be subject to income tax 
as discussed above in item under the heading business introduction tax aspects of our business strategy  subject to various regulatory limitations  under federal and state tax laws  we are permitted to use these losses to reduce the income taxes we otherwise would have to pay on future income 
as a result  we could have little or no income tax liability for a period of time if we are able to become profitable and generate taxable income 
see the discussion below under the heading risk factors we may not be able to realize value from our tax loss carryforwards for more information on the risks associated with our ability to use these accumulated losses 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table reflects use of net cash for operations  investing  and financing net cash used by operating activities from continuing operations net cash used by discontinued operations net cash used by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
while our operating activities have not generated cash historically  we expect that as we more fully implement our mbs business strategy  our continuing operations will begin to generate cash during  reflecting further reductions in operating expenses  reduced restructuring payments  the completion of transition service obligations associated with the sales of our mobile and wireless data businesses  and the elimination of interest payments related to our subordinated notes 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for  consisting primarily of million from the liquidation of investments primarily united states government agency sponsored securities as discussed above under the heading investment gain loss  including impairments  net 
additionally  we used million to purchase mortgage backed securities and received million  million  and million from the sale of our ems  transportation  and mobile government segments  respectively  net of transaction expenses  and received million from the sale of investments in indivos corporation and juniper financial that we had made through aether capital llc net cash provided by investing activities was million for we received million for the net sale of short term and non current investment instruments primarily united states government agency sponsored securities 
additionally  we used approximately  for the purchase of property and equipment which was sold as part of the dispositions we completed in and received approximately million from sales of certain property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million for and consisted primarily of the million of purchases of short term and non current investment instruments  net of sales 
additionally  approximately million was used for the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash used by financing activities was million for  consisting primarily of million used to redeem the remaining outstanding convertible subordinated notes  as discussed above 
additionally  we received million from the expiration of certain letters of credit in net cash used in financing activities was million for during  financing activities included the investment of approximately million of cash in certificates of deposit  which was used as collateral against certain letters of credit 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  which primarily consisted of million used for the repurchase of a portion of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due march as of december   we had investments available for sale totaling approximately million that were classified as non current assets since they all had maturities after december  during  we liquated these investments and used the proceeds to redeem our remaining outstanding subordinated notes and invest in mbs 
as of december   our cash balances and liquid investments including our investments in mbs and other us government agency sponsored securities and excluding restricted cash accounted for approximately million of the total assets on our balance sheet 
our total liabilities as of the same date were approximately million 
the net impact on our financial condition of our various strategic and operating activities during as reflected by these cash flows was to use a portion of our available cash to reduce our long term liabilities  to convert various current and other assets that were used in our mobile and wireless data businesses into cash  to eliminate various liabilities related to our discontinued operations through assignment of such liabilities to the buyers of those operations and to begin to move a significant portion of our available cash into our mbs business 
capital resources and liquidity we anticipate that our primary source of funds with which to leverage our mbs portfolio will be repurchase agreements 
at december   we had master repurchase arrangements in place with four counterparties with no repurchase agreements outstanding 
these master repurchase arrangements have no stated expiration but can be terminated at any time at our option or at the option of the counterparty 
however  once a definitive repurchase agreement under a master repurchase arrangement has been entered into  it generally may not be terminated by either party 
increases in short term interest rates could negatively impact the valuation of our mortgage related securities  which could limit our borrowing ability or cause our counterparties under our master repurchase arrangements to initiate margin calls 
this would increase our liquidity needs and could reduce our ability to borrow 
as discussed above in item under the heading business mortgage backed securities leverage and borrowing strategy  we expect to enter into definitive repurchase arrangements to fund most of the amounts that will be required to purchase mbs under the forward contract arrangements we entered into during february and march for liquidity  we will also rely on cash flow from operations  primarily monthly principal and interest payments to be received on our mbs 
we believe that cash flow from operations  and funding available through our master repurchase arrangements  will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated liquidity requirements and plans to build our mbs portfolio 
various changes in market conditions could adversely affect our liquidity  including increases in interest rates and increases in prepayment rates substantially above our expectations 
if our cash resources are at any time insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to meet margin calls  liquidate mortgage related securities or sell debt or additional equity securities 
if required  the sale of mortgage related securities at prices lower than the carrying value of such assets would result in losses and reduced income 
we may in the future seek to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity and debt securities 
additional equity offerings may be dilutive to stockholders equity or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of any additional offerings as they will depend upon market conditions and other factors  including limitations under applicable tax laws relating to our accumulated tax loss carryforwards  as discussed above under the heading risk factors we may not be able to realize value from our tax loss carryforwards 
letters of credit as of december   we have three letters of credit million outstanding that expire at various times over the next four years 
the largest of these serves as collateral assurance to secure the performance of bio key international  inc  the buyer of the mobile government segment  to hamilton county  ohio under a sales agreement that was assigned to bio key as part of the sale of the mobile government business 
the remaining two letters of credit serve as collateral to secure our performance on leased office space  including the massachusetts office space used by the mobile government business  which we have sublet to bio key 
see the discussion under the heading guarantees below and in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a more detailed discussion of the mobile government letters of credit  including arrangements that we have in place with bio key to provide for repayment if these letters of credit are drawn 
guarantees as of december   we have made the following guarantees we have guaranteed the payments on two leases that were assigned to the buyers of our mobile and wireless data businesses 
the maximum guarantee on these leases is approximately  as of december   we had million of our certificates of deposit that were being held on deposit to collateralize an irrevocable standby letter of credit put in place when our mobile government segment entered into a sales agreement with hamilton county  ohio to provide an automated field reporting solution and real time wireless data infrastructure under a sales agreement 
the letter of credit provides collateral assurance of performance under the sales agreement 
the terms of the sales agreement and the standby letter of credit state that hamilton county can only draw on the letter of credit after completing the internal dispute resolution process set forth in the sales agreement and providing notice to mobile government of its intent to declare a default under the sales agreement and proceed against the letter of credit 
a draw of the funds under the letter of credit is subject to the limitations of liability contained in the sales agreement 
the letter of credit is required to remain in place through the earlier of the end of the warranty period or december  the amount of the letter of credit can be reduced by at the end of the third calendar month of the warranty period as long as certain conditions are met 
although we sold the mobile government business to bio key international  inc on september   we agreed to maintain the million letter of credit in favor of hamilton county 
in consideration of this arrangement  and to assure repayment to us of any amounts that hamilton county collects by drawing on the letter of credit as a result of a default by bio key  bio key has provided us with a million escrow and a million subordinated secured promissory note the bio key note 
we are entitled to retain the million and to demand payment under the bio key note if hamilton county draws on the letter of credit 
the bio key note is secured by a second lien on substantially all of bio key s assets 
the lien is subordinated to million of senior secured debt held by certain of bio key s lenders 
as discussed above in item  under the heading introduction and overview  we have evaluated our potential exposure under this arrangement in accordance with fin and have recorded a liability of  on our balance sheet 
additionally  we are maintaining the facility lease for the mobile government headquarters in massachusetts and sub leasing it to bio key 
as a condition to consenting to the sublease  the landlord required us to maintain a  letter of credit to the landlord securing performance under the lease 
bio key has provided us with a  deposit that would be available in the event of bio key s default on the sublease that results in a draw on our letter of credit 
the total remaining payments under both the lease and the sublease are approximately million and the lease expires in august contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual commitments  including our future minimum lease payments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations facility leases less subleases facility leases  net capital lease obligations mbs purchase obligations other purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total during february and march  we entered into obligations under forward purchase arrangements with an estimated face value of million 
these forward purchase arrangements come due at different times in march and april  at which point  we expect to enter into repurchase transactions to provide us with most of the funding we will need to satisfy these obligations 
in addition to the obligations above  we have guaranteed the lease payments for some assigned leases on properties related to discontinued operations 
we have also provided collateral assurance in the form of a letter of credit in support of bio key s performance obligations under the hamilton county  ohio project 
these obligations are discussed above under the heading guarantees and in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we have not included contracts for maintenance support on hardware or software that we own because we generally pay in advance for these services and have the option of choosing whether or not to renew these services each year 
we have also not included in this table potential contingent liabilities that we may have to the buyers of our ems  transportation or mobile government segments  under the terms of the purchase agreements with the buyers and we cannot readily estimate the potential amount of liabilities that might arise in the future  if any 
potential liabilities to the buyers of our mobile and wireless data businesses are discussed below under the heading risk factors risks associated with our mobile and wireless data businesses 
off balance sheet arrangements except as discussed above  we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
risk factors our business activities are subject to various important risks and uncertainties  including the following risks of our current business strategy there is no assurance that we will be able to manage our current business strategy successfully or realize our objectives 
prior to entering the mbs business  we explored several strategic options with the assistance of outside advisors 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in managing a portfolio of mbs or that we will be able to generate a profit and create value for our stockholders 
the company has historically invested its excess cash in united states government agency sponsored securities and does not have any past experience with investments in mbs 
our current management team has limited experience in the mbs markets  in making investments in mbs  or in managing a leveraged investment portfolio 
we have not developed an earnings history or experienced varying interest rate environments or market conditions 
we have not yet fully implemented our current business strategy of investing in mbs  and we may alter or diversify our focus  which may introduce new or additional risks 
we are in the process of implementing our mbs investment strategy 
as of march   we had invested approximately million of our available cash in mbs and had entered into forward purchase arrangements representing commitments to purchase mbs in march and april with an estimated face value of approximately million 
we also have begun to evaluate other potential business opportunities that may complement our mbs business or diversify our overall business strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully and successfully implement our current mbs strategy  whether as a result of market conditions or for other business reasons  or that the strategy  if fully implemented  will produce results consistent with our expectations 
in addition  if in the future we pursue other business strategies  they may have different business and market risks and considerations 
accordingly  our business and our strategy  and the associated risks  may change significantly over time 
we will depend on borrowings to expand our mbs portfolio 
if we fail to obtain or to renew sufficient funding on favorable terms or at all  we may incur losses 
we will depend on short term borrowings  primarily repurchase agreements  to fund purchases of mbs and reach our desired amount of leverage 
we will need to borrow funds to purchase the mbs underlying the forward purchase commitments that we entered into in february and march  and we expect to receive such funding through the use of repurchase agreements 
accordingly  our ability to satisfy commitments to purchase additional mbs and achieve our investment and leverage objectives depends on our ability to enter into repurchase agreements in sufficient amounts and on favorable terms 
in addition  because repurchase agreements are short term arrangements and mbs are long term securities  we must be able to continually renew or replace outstanding repurchase agreements as they mature 
we currently have repurchase arrangements with four lenders to provide financing for our purchases of mbs 
these arrangements are not commitments to lend money to us 
if we are unable to obtain funds to satisfy our mbs purchase commitments  or if we are unable to renew or replace maturing borrowings on favorable terms or at all  our financial condition and results could be materially and adversely affected 
we could be required to sell our mbs or to sell forward purchase commitments prior to their settlement  or sell the underlying mbs at the time of settlement under adverse market conditions  or for prices and on terms that are less favorable than those we might otherwise be able to secure 
in such situations  we may be forced to sell investments at a loss 
an increase in prepayment rates may adversely affect us 
the mbs we plan to acquire are backed by pools of underlying mortgage loans 
we will receive payments  generally  from the payments that will be made on these underlying mortgage loans 
when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans at rates that are faster than expected  the result is that our mbs are prepaid faster than expected 
these accelerated prepayments may adversely affect the performance of our business 
prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise  but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict 
prepayment rates also may be affected by conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans 
we may purchase mbs that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time 
in exchange for this higher interest rate  we would likely pay a premium over the market value to acquire the security 
in accordance with accounting rules  we will amortize this premium ratably over the term of the mbs 
if the mbs is prepaid in whole or in part prior to its maturity date  however  we will be required to expense all or a corresponding portion  in the case of a partial prepayment of the remaining unamortized portion of the premium 
this accelerated expensing would negatively impact the yield from the mbs 
we may seek to reduce the potential negative impact of increased prepayments by acquiring mbs at a discount 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we will recognize this discount ratably over the term of the mbs 
if a discounted security is prepaid in whole or in part prior to its maturity date  we will recognize income equal to the amount of the discount not previously recognized or a portion of such remaining discount  in the case of a partial prepayment 
consequently  the reported performance of our business would be enhanced if discounted securities are prepaid faster than expected 
while we will seek to minimize prepayment risk to the extent practical  in selecting investments we will manage the prepayment risk against other risks and the potential returns of each investment 
no strategy  however  can completely insulate us from prepayment risk 
an increase in interest rates might adversely affect the book value of our mbs 
increases in the general level of interest rates can cause the fair market value of our assets to decline  particularly those mortgage backed securities whose underlying mortgages have fixed rate components 
generally  hybrid adjustable rate mbs during the fixed rate component of the mortgages underlying such securities  which comprised of our mbs  will be more negatively affected by such increases than adjustable rate mortgage securities 
in accordance with gaap  we will be required to reduce the carrying value of our mortgage backed securities by the amount of any decrease in the fair value of our mortgage backed securities compared to their respective amortized costs 
if unrealized losses in fair value occur  we will have to either reduce current earnings or reduce stockholders equity without immediately affecting current earnings  depending on how we classify such mortgage backed securities under gaap 
in either case  our net book value will decrease to the extent of any realized or unrealized losses in fair value 
our cash balances and cash flows may become limited relative to our cash needs 
we need cash to meet our working capital and other needs 
cash is required to pay our operating expenses and fund our investments 
cash flows from principal repayments could be reduced should prepayments slow or should credit quality trends deteriorate 
we intend to maintain what we believe are ample cash balances to meet our projected needs 
in the event  however  that our liquidity needs exceed our access to liquidity  we may need to sell assets at an inopportune time  which could negatively impact our business 
limitations on our ability to raise additional capital through sales of shares of our capital stock may restrict our ability to address liquidity needs through stock issuances and may limit our ability to expand our mbs portfolio by raising additional capital through such stock offerings 
because of limitations imposed by sections and of the internal revenue code  which regulate our ability to use our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards in the future as discussed below  there are limits on the number of additional shares of stock we can sell to raise additional capital 
accordingly  assuming market conditions would otherwise permit us to sell additional shares of our stock  this legal limit may prevent us from raising as much additional capital through sales of our stock as we might want or need at any particular time 
as a result  we may be unable to address a specific liquidity need through a sale of our stock 
we also may not be able to increase the size of our mbs portfolio as much or as rapidly as we would otherwise like  because of limits on our ability to raise additional cash through stock offerings 
we may change our investment policies and guidelines without stockholder approval 
our board of directors and management determine all of our investment policies and guidelines 
although there is currently no plan to amend or revise these policies  the board of directors and management may amend or revise these investment policies and guidelines at any time without notice to stockholders 
changes to the leverage ratio  types of securities included in our portfolio and changes to our risk management policies could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  or the market price of our common stock 
competition may increase and negatively impact our business 
the success of our business depends  in large part  on our ability to acquire mbs at favorable spreads over borrowing costs  as well as our ability to sell mbs at favorable prices when necessary in response to changing market conditions 
in acquiring and selling mbs  we compete against reits  financial institutions  such as banks  savings and loans  life insurance companies and institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds 
many of these entities have greater financial resources than us and as a result  we may not be able to acquire sufficient mbs at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs 
in addition  we may face competition for a limited number of buyers at a time when we are seeking to sell mbs  which could result in us receiving less favorable prices for mbs that we sell 
existing competitors may grow  and new competition may enter the market over time  all of which can increase competition and may result in less favorable pricing and lower yields on assets 
defaults on the mortgage loans underlying our mbs may reduce the value of our investment portfolio and may harm our results of operations 
we bear the risk of any losses resulting from any defaults on the mortgage loans underlying the mbs in our investment portfolio 
the mortgage backed securities that we purchase will be subject to limited guarantees of the payment of limited amounts of principal and interest on mortgage loans underlying such mbs  either by federal government agencies  including ginnie mae  by federally chartered corporations  including fannie mae and freddie mac  or by other corporate guarantors 
while ginnie mae s obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states  the obligations of fannie mae and freddie mac and other corporate guarantors are solely their own 
as a result  a substantial deterioration in the financial strength of fannie mae  freddie mac or other corporate guarantors could increase our exposure to future delinquencies  defaults or credit losses on our holdings of fannie mae or freddie mac backed mbs or other corporate backed mbs  and could harm our results of operations 
in addition  while freddie mac guarantees the eventual payment of principal  it does not guarantee the timely payment thereof  and our results of operations may be harmed if borrowers are late or delinquent in their payments on mortgages underlying freddie mac backed mortgage backed securities 
moreover  fannie mae  freddie mac  ginnie mae and other corporate guarantees relate only to payments of limited amounts of principal and interest on the mortgages underlying such agency backed or corporate backed securities  and do not guarantee the market value of such mbs or the yields on such mbs 
as a result  we remain subject to interest rate risks  prepayment risks  extension risks and other risks associated with our investment in such mbs and may experience losses in our investment portfolio 
a prolonged economic slow down  a lengthy or severe recession or declining real estate values could harm our operations 
the residential mortgage market has experienced considerable growth during the past ten years  with total outstanding us mortgage debt growing from approximately trillion at the end of to approximately trillion as of december   according to the bond market association and the federal reserve 
if this growth cannot be sustained or we suffer an economic recession  the market for mbs may be adversely affected 
we may exceed our target leverage ratios 
we seek to maintain an asset to equity ratio between and however  we are not required to stay within this ratio if our board of directors approves a deviation from established investment guidelines 
we will incur leverage by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of the mbs we acquire 
by incurring these borrowings we expect to be able to enhance our returns  but these borrowings  which are fundamental to our strategy  also create significant risks 
historically  we have managed a business with relatively modest borrowings  as compared to our available cash resources 
accordingly  we do not have experience managing a business within the constraints that can be imposed by the use of leverage 
in addition  if we exceed this ratio  the adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations from the types of risks described above would likely be more severe 
borrowings may negatively affect the performance of our portfolio of mbs 
because our mortgage backed securities strategy will involve the use of leverage  our returns on invested capital and trading activities may be negatively affected or our mortgage backed securities portfolio may incur substantial losses if our borrowing costs increase faster than the returns on our investments 
we expect that all of our borrowings will be collateralized borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements 
if the interest rates on these repurchase agreements increase  this would adversely affect performance of our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
our borrowing costs under repurchase agreements will generally correspond to short term interest rates such as libor or a short term treasury index  plus or minus a margin 
our borrowing costs may increase for any of the following reasons short term interest rates increase  the market value of our investment securities decreases  interest rate volatility increases  or the availability of financing in the market decreases 
if these costs increase faster than the rates paid by the securities in which we invest  the financial results of our new mortgage backed securities strategy will be negatively affected 
while we may use hedging strategies to manage interest rate sensitivity of our borrowings  such strategies may not be effective under certain conditions and may have a negative effect on the performance of our portfolio of mortgage backed securities  as discussed below 
differences in timing of interest rate adjustments on our acquired securities and on our borrowings may adversely affect our mbs strategy and the returns on the portion of our cash we invest in mbs 
we will rely primarily on short term borrowings to acquire mbs with long term maturities 
accordingly  if short term interest rates increase  this may adversely affect our investment strategy and the returns on our capital 
we expect all of the mbs we will acquire will be adjustable rate securities 
this means that their interest rates may vary over time based upon changes in an objective index  such as libor the interest rate that banks in london offer for deposits in london of us dollars 
treasury rate a monthly or weekly average yield of benchmark us treasury securities  as published by the federal reserve board 
cd rate the weekly average of secondary market interest rates on six month negotiable certificates of deposit  as published by the federal reserve board 
these indices generally reflect short term interest rates 
in a period of rising interest rates  we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss from our mbs portfolio  because the interest rates on our borrowings likely will adjust upward faster than the interest rates on our adjustable rate securities 
interest rate caps may reduce the returns from our business 
adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mbs are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
periodic interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase during any given period 
lifetime interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase over the life of the security 
our borrowings will not be subject to similar restrictions 
accordingly  in a period of rapidly increasing interest rates  we would experience a decrease in net income or experience a net loss from our mbs portfolio because increases in the interest rates on our borrowings will not be limited  while increases in the interest rates on our adjustable rate securities would be capped 
hedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect performance of our portfolio of mbs 
we may enter into derivative transactions and other hedging strategies  such as interest rate swaps and caps  options to purchase swaps and caps  financial futures contracts and options on futures that are intended to hedge our exposure to rising rates on funds borrowed to finance our investment securities 
interest rate hedging may fail to reduce exposure to interest rate and prepayment risks discussed in this risk factors section because  among other things interest rate hedging can be expensive  particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates  and the cost of implementing the hedge may offset its potential benefit  available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  and the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs its ability to sell or assign its side of the hedging transaction 
our borrowings may result in margin calls and defaults and force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions 
because we will purchase mbs with borrowed funds  a decline in the value of our investment securities  caused by rising interest rates or prepayments  may result in our lenders initiating margin calls 
a margin call means that the lender requires us to pledge additional collateral to re establish the ratio of the value of the collateral to the amount of the borrowing 
if we are unable to satisfy margin calls  our lenders may foreclose on our collateral 
this could force us to sell our mbs under adverse market conditions where the value of the collateral securing our borrowing is less than the amount owed to our lenders 
in this case  we would be responsible for any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the amounts we borrowed 
additionally  repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the bankruptcy code 
this special treatment would allow the lenders under these agreements to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and to liquidate the collateral under these agreements without delay 
we are dependent on fbr to assist us in managing the portfolio of mbs 
because we do not have experience in managing a leveraged portfolio of mbs  we will be heavily dependent on the efforts and expertise of fbr 
if we were to lose fbr s services  our ability to fulfill our objectives and carry out our mbs strategy could be adversely affected 
although we have a one year agreement with fbr to manage our portfolio of mbs  following the initial one year term of the agreement  fbr could terminate the agreement with days prior written notice and cease providing services to us after an additional days  if we request that fbr continue to manage our mbs portfolio during a transitional period 
during the term of the agreement  unanticipated changes in circumstances to us or fbr could result in fbr ceasing to provide services to us 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that fbr will continue to work with us 
in addition  it may be difficult for us  within a reasonable period of time  to replace fbr with another firm having comparable expertise and offering comparable financial terms 
the manager of our mbs portfolio  fbr  may have a potential conflict of interest 
fbr manages a multi billion dollar portfolio of mortgage backed securities for an affiliate using a strategy very similar to the one we plan to implement 
fbr or one of its affiliates also may manage portfolios using strategies similar to this strategy for other asset management clients 
these relationships create potential conflicts of interest  including the allocation of opportunities to acquire or sell mbs at favorable prices 
as noted above  our strategy depends in part upon our ability to acquire such securities at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs 
we also may seek to sell mbs in response to unfavorable market conditions at a time when many other mbs investors are seeking to sell 
fbr has no obligation to resolve in our favor conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with competing portfolios 
employees of fbr will only devote the time and attention to our new mortgage backed securities strategy that they deem necessary in their discretion  and there may be conflicts in allocating time  services and functions between our portfolio and other portfolios that fbr manages 
the failure of employees of fbr to devote adequate time and attention to our mbs strategy could adversely affect the performance of our business 
fbr s past performance or the performance of other companies that invest in mbs may not be indicative of how our mbs portfolio will perform 
the operations and results of any business with which fbr or its related companies have been or are associated or of any other company that follows a strategy similar to the one we are implementing are not intended to be  and should not be considered as  any indication of the likely future performance of our leveraged portfolio of mbs 
the performance of our mbs portfolio will be affected by changes in market conditions  prepayment rates  availability of financing and interest rates  which are outside of our control or the control of fbr 
in addition  other companies employing a strategy similar to the one we are pursuing may have different investment policies or greater financial resources than we have 
therefore  the past performance of fbr or other companies that use a strategy similar to ours is no guarantee  and may not be indicative  of the future performance of our portfolio of mbs 
regulatory and tax risks of our mbs business loss of investment company act exemption would adversely affect us 
in managing a leveraged portfolio of mbs  we intend to rely on an exemption from the investment company act for companies that are engaged primarily in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate 
under the sec staff s current interpretation of that exemption  in order to meet the criteria for such exemption  we will have to maintain at least of our assets in qualifying real estate interests  such as whole pool mortgage interests issued by fhlmc  fnma or gnma  and at least of our assets in other real estate related assets  such as non whole pool mortgage backed securities 
this minimum is reduced to the extent we invest more than of our assets in qualifying real estate interests 
these requirements may limit our ability to purchase certain types of mbs that might otherwise be attractive  and these restrictions could result in a lower level of income from our portfolio 
changes in the investment company act or the rules thereunder  or in the sec staff s interpretation of the statute and rules  could force us to sell a substantial portion of our portfolio under potentially adverse market conditions 
in addition  the use of leverage is a fundamental part of our mbs strategy 
in the event we were required to register as an investment company under the investment company act  our ability to use leverage and the returns on our equity capital would be substantially reduced  we would suffer additional regulatory costs and expenses and we would not be able to pursue our mbs business as described in this annual report 
we may not be able to realize value from our tax loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire between and in addition  we had capital loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire between and in the event we undergo a future ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code  our net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitation  which could reduce  eliminate  or defer the utilization of these losses 
based upon a review of past changes in our ownership  as of december  we do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change as defined under section that would result in any limitation on our future ability to use these net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards 
however  we can not assure you that the irs or some other taxing authority may not disagree with our position and contend that we have already experienced such an ownership change  which would severely limit our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
generally  an ownership change occurs if one or more stockholders  each of whom owns or more in value of a corporation s stock  increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such stockholders at any time during the preceding three year period 
for example  if a single stockholder owning of our stock acquired an additional of our stock in a three year period  a change of ownership would occur 
similarly  if ten persons  none of whom owned our stock  each acquired slightly over of our stock within a three year period so that such persons own  in the aggregate more than an ownership change would occur 
ownership of stock here is determined by certain constructive ownership rules which can attribute ownership of stock owned by entities such as estates  trusts  corporations  and partnerships to the ultimate indirect owner 
for purposes of this rule  all holders who each own less than of a corporation s stock are generally treated together as one or  in certain cases  more than one stockholder 
transactions in the public markets among stockholders owning less than of the equity securities generally are not included in the calculation 
special rules can result in the treatment of options including warrants or other similar interests as having been exercised if such treatment would result in an ownership change 
due to the importance of avoiding a future ownership change under the tax laws  we will be limited in our ability to issue additional stock in the future to provide capital for our business 
we would only be able to issue such additional stock in a manner that would not cause an ownership change  for purposes of these rules  and thus  as discussed above  our ability to access the equity markets could be restricted  to some extent 
we may not be able to use our tax loss carryforwards because we may not generate taxable income 
the use of our net operating loss carryforwards is subject to uncertainty because it is dependent upon the amount of taxable income we generate 
similarly  the extent of our actual use of our capital loss carryforwards is also subject to uncertainty because their use depends on the amount of capital gains we generate 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income or capital gains in future years to use the net operating loss carryforwards or capital loss carryfowards before they expire 
this is especially true for the capital loss carryfowards  because they expire over a shorter period of time than the net operating loss carryforwards 
the irs could challenge the amount of our tax loss carryforwards 
the amount of our net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards has not been audited or otherwise validated by the irs 
the irs could challenge the amount of our net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards  which could result in an increase in our liability for income taxes 
in addition  calculating whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty  both because of the complexity and ambiguity of section and because of limitations on a publicly traded company s knowledge as to the ownership of  and transactions in  its securities 
therefore  we cannot assure you that the calculation of the amount of our net loss carryforwards may not be changed as a result of a challenge by a governmental authority or our learning of new information about the ownership of  and transactions in  our securities 
we expect to be subject to the alternative minimum tax  and our net loss carryforwards would not offset that tax in its entirety 
we do not plan to seek to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code and we will therefore continue to be subject to state and federal income tax 
however  as a result of our capital loss carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards  we anticipate our federal income tax liability for the current fiscal year as well as for several years into the future to be substantially reduced 
we do expect to be subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the internal revenue code which limits the use of net operating loss carryforwards 
these provisions would result  in effect  in of our alternative minimum taxable income being subject to the alternative minimum tax assessed on corporations 
this amounts to a effective tax rate on our alternative minimum taxable income 
the irs may seek to impose the accumulated earnings tax on some or all of the taxable income we retain 
as a component of our mbs investment strategy  we expect to retain all or a substantial portion of future earnings over the next several years to finance the development and growth of our business 
as a result  we may not declare or pay any significant dividends on shares of our common stock for an extended period 
if the irs were to believe we were accumulating earnings beyond our reasonable business needs  the irs could seek to impose an accumulated earnings tax  or aet  of on our accumulated taxable income 
we do not believe that we will be subject to the aet due to various reasons  including the existence of our large deficit in accumulated earnings and profits 
however  the irs may disagree with us on this point  and the irs may attempt to impose the aet on all or a portion of our taxable income 
in such event  we would expect to challenge any attempt by the irs to impose the aet on our business  but the outcome of such a challenge is uncertain 
if we were to distribute our accumulated taxable income for each year to our stockholders as dividends  we would not be subject to the aet for the amounts so distributed  but would only be subject to the aet for the amount of earnings retained 
if we were to pay dividends to stockholders out of current earnings  these dividends would  generally speaking  be eligible to be treated as qualified dividends for federal income tax purposes  taxed at the current maximum federal rate of  assuming that the recipient stockholder meets the various requirements under the internal revenue code for such treatment 
the maximum rate for qualified dividends is currently projected to increase to the maximum federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income currently for tax years beginning after december  in accordance with the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of possible changes in legislation could negatively affect our investments 
prospective investors should recognize that the present us federal income tax treatment of an investment in our stock may be modified by legislative  judicial or administrative action at any time  and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made 
the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us treasury department  resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes 
revisions in us federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in our stock and could impair our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our net loss carryforwards 
however  we are not aware of any proposed changes in the tax laws or regulations that would materially impact our ability to use our net loss carryforwards 
limits on ownership of our common stock could have an adverse consequence to you and could limit your opportunity to receive a premium on our stock 
as noted above  it is important that we avoid an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code  in order to retain the ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards to offset future income 
this means that a potential buyer of our stock might be deterred from acquiring our common stock while we still have significant tax losses being carried forward  because such an acquisition might trigger an ownership change and severely impair our ability to use our tax losses against future income 
thus  this potential tax situation could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control and  therefore  could adversely affect our shareholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with a change in control 
risks associated with our mobile and wireless data businesses we may be required to indemnify the purchasers of our ems  transportation and mobile government segments 
we may be required to indemnify tcs  slingshot and or bio key for certain breaches of representations and warranties and other covenants that we gave to tcs  slingshot and bio key with respect to the sales of the ems  transportation and mobile government segments  respectively 
our liability to slingshot is limited to million  other than in the case of fraud and with respect to a small number of specific representations  such as those relating to taxes owed for periods prior to the closing of the sale of the transportation segment 
in addition  we remain fully liable for any claims that may arise relating to our operation of the transportation business prior to the date on which slingshot acquired that business from us 
the dispute we are having with slingshot over post closing adjustments is not subject to the terms of this indemnity and any payments we might be required to make would not be subject to or count against the indemnity limits 
our liability to bio key is limited to million  other than in the case of fraud and with respect to a small number of specific representations  such as those relating to taxes owed for periods prior to the closing of the sale of the mobile government segment 
we also remain fully liable for any claims that may arise relating to our operation of the mobile government business prior to the date on which bio key acquired that business from us 
we have agreed to maintain certain credit support and performance assurance arrangements on behalf of bio key 
under a sales agreement with hamilton county  ohio  our potential liability is secured by a million letter of credit to assure performance under the terms of that sales agreement 
we also have been required to sublease rather than assign to bio key the mobile government leased facility in marlborough  massachusetts  and to keep in place a  letter of credit in favor of the landlord under the lease 
for a discussion of these arrangements  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we may also be required to indemnify tcs for certain breaches of representations and warranties and other covenants that we gave to tcs with respect to the sale of our ems segment 
this liability is limited to million  other than in the case of fraud and with respect to a small number of specific representations  such as those relating to taxes owed for periods prior to the closing of the sale of the ems segment 
in addition  we remain fully liable for any claims that may arise relating to our operation of the ems business prior to the date on which tcs acquired that business from us  including any liability arising from our past sales of the blackberry devices manufactured by research in motion rim 
currently  rim is engaged in legal proceedings with inpro ii to determine whether certain rim products infringed on patents held by inpro or ntp  inc we have not been named in this suit  but may be liable to inpro or ntp  inc if it is established that rim s blackberry actually infringes inpro s patents 
a mediation conference is scheduled for this matter in may other than our dispute with slingshot over post closing adjustments  which is discussed above under the heading sales of discontinued operations  we are not currently aware of any potential claims that we would expect to be significant 
however  claims may arise in the future that could impose substantial liabilities on us 
other risks of our business compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  have required most public companies  including our company  to devote additional internal and external resources to various governance and compliance matters 
because we have a relatively small corporate staff  we rely heavily on outside professional advisers to assist us with these efforts 
as a result  we incurred additional operating expenses in and and will incur further expenses in the future 
these costs have included increased accounting related fees associated with preparing the attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting as required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of these costs have offset a portion of the savings we realized through our expense reduction program 
in addition  these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  as well as modifications by the government and nasdaq 
the way in which they are applied and implemented may change over time  which could result in even higher costs to address and implement revisions to compliance including disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and in addition to increased general and administrative expenses  this investment will require management to devote time and attention that will not be available for other matters 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed and we could be exposed to potential liability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
we seek to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  and prepayment risks inherent in our mbs investment strategy in a responsible manner designed to promote our growth and success while  at the same time  seeking to maximize stockholder value 
we are not planning to be adverse to risk  but are aiming to assume only those risks we believe we can manage and which we believe will produce a sufficient return to justify taking those risks 
interest rate risk we plan to invest primarily in adjustable rate mbs 
as we continue to build our portfolio of mbs  our debt obligations will generally be short term repurchase agreements that are periodically financed at current market prices 
adjustable rate mbs are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps that limit the amount an adjustable rate mbs s interest rate can change during any given period 
also  adjustable rate mbs may be subject to a maximum interest rate payable 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions and therefore  in a period of rising interest rates  the interest rates on our borrowings could increase without limitation  while the interest rates on our mbs may not experience corresponding increases 
in addition  certain mbs may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would negatively impact our liquidity and net income 
as we continue to implement our mbs investment strategy and use leverage for the acquisition of new securities  we will fund the purchase of a substantial portion of our portfolio with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but generally with shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the mbs 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our net income and the market price of our common stock 
market value risk although we intend to hold mbs investments that we make to their maturities  we may sell them at any time in response to market conditions 
as a result  substantially all of our mbs investments will be classified as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at fair value ie market value  with any adjustment between cost and fair value being reflected as part of accumulated other comprehensive income that is included in the equity section of our balance sheet 
the market value of our assets can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and other factors including loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our mbs and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
the chart below illustrates the effect on portfolio value should interest rates rapidly increase or decrease by and basis points a rate shock 
we have estimated the impact  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
our portfolio of mbs as of december  was valued at million 
assumptions made in calculating the impact on our mbs portfolio value from interest rate shocks include interest rates  prepayments and yield spread of mbs relative to prevailing interest rates 
change in interest rate projected change in mbs portfolio value basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
liquidity risk our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mbs with short term borrowings 
the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently than the interest rates on our mbs 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  our borrowing costs will usually increase faster than our interest earnings from mbs 
as a result  we could experience a decrease in net income or an increase in net loss during these periods 
assets that are pledged to secure short term borrowings will be high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  we do not expect to have any problems rolling over our short term debt as it matures 
however  there can be no assurance that we will always be able to roll over our short term debt 
prepayment risk we are also subject to prepayment risk 
prepayments are the full or partial repayment of principal prior to the original term to maturity of a mortgage loan and typically occur due to refinancing of mortgage loans 
prepayment rates on mbs vary from time to time and may cause changes in the amount of our net interest income 
prepayments of adjustable rate and hybrid mbs generally increase when mortgage interest rates fall and generally decrease when mortgage interest rates exceed the then current interest rate on such mortgages 
prepayment experience also may be affected by the conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions  seasonal changes and the relative interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans underlying mbs 
the price we pay for mbs is partially determined by our expectations of the amounts and rates of prepayments 
if we expect few prepayments  we may pay a premium for the mbs we acquire 
if our assumptions are wrong and the actual amount of prepayments is greater than expected  we could experience reduced earnings or losses 
in addition  if we were unable to acquire new mbs to replace the amounts received as prepayments  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
for a more detailed discussion of the risk of prepayments on our business  see the disclosure under the heading risk factors an increase in prepayment rates may adversely affect us
