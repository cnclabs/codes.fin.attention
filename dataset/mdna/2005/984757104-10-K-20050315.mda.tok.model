item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  restructuring costs  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  debt service and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about operating results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve its more significant estimates and judgments and are therefore particularly important to an understanding of our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents sales receivables we sell our products both directly to retail customers and through wholesale channels 
sales from the sale of merchandise to retail customers are recognized at the time of sale  while sales from wholesale customers are recognized when risk of loss has passed to the customers 
we believe that this is the time that persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales are recognized net of any applicable discounts and allowances 
customers  be they retail or wholesale  do have the right to return product to us in certain limited situations 
such rights of return have not precluded sales recognition because we have a long history with such returns  which we use in constructing a reserve 
this reserve  however  is subject to change 
in addition to returns  we bear credit risk relative to our wholesale customers 
we have provided a reserve for bad debts in our financial statements based on our estimates of the creditworthiness of our customers 
however  this reserve is also subject to change 
changes in these reserves could affect our operating results 
inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in addition  our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market on a last in first out lifo basis 
fluctuations in inventory levels along with the cost of raw materials could impact the carrying value of our inventory 
changes in the carrying value of inventory could affect our operating results 
taxes we have a significant net deferred tax asset recorded on our financial statements 
this asset arose at the time of our recapitalization in and is a future tax deduction for us 
the recoverability of this future tax deduction is dependent upon our future profitability 
we have made an assessment that this asset is likely to be recovered and is appropriately reflected on the balance sheet 
should we find that we are not able to utilize this deduction in the future we would have to record a reserve for all or a part of this asset  which would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles long lived assets on our balance sheet consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  customer list  tradename  goodwill and trademarks 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows 
we undertake this review when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished and at least annually in the case of tradename and goodwill 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
while we believe that our future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
stock based compensation effective in  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under the prospective transition method selected by us  as described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
 all stock option grants beginning with grants made in fiscal are being expensed over the vesting period  based on the fair value at the date of the grant 
fair value is determined based on a variety of factors  all of which are estimates subject to judgment 
changes in estimated lives of options  risk free interest rates or exercise patterns could impact our results of operations 
we recorded a charge of 
table of contents approximately million and million for the fifty two weeks ended january  and fifty three weeks ended january   respectively 
in the third quarter of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  we will be required to record the fair value of stock options for all unvested options granted prior to this will result in additional stock compensation expense of approximately million during the second half of fiscal performance measures we measure the performance of our retail and wholesale segments through a segment margin calculation  which specifically identifies not only gross profit on the sales of products through the two channels but also costs and expenses specifically related to each segment 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results we have experienced  and may experience in the future  fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
there are numerous factors that can contribute to these fluctuations  however  the principal factors are seasonality and new store openings 
seasonality 
we have historically realized higher revenues and operating income in our fourth quarter  particularly in our retail business 
we believe that this has been due primarily to the increase in the number of our retail stores and to increased sales in the giftware industry during the holiday season of the fourth quarter 
new store openings 
the timing of our new store openings may also have an impact on our quarterly results 
first  we incur certain one time expenses related to opening each new store 
these expenses  which consist primarily of salaries  occupancy costs  supplies and marketing costs  are expensed as incurred 
second  most store expenses vary proportionately with sales  but there is a fixed cost component 
this typically results in lower store profitability when a new store opens because new stores generally have lower sales than mature stores 
due to both of these factors  during periods when new store openings as a percentage of the base are higher  operating profit may decline in dollars and or as a percentage of sales 
as the overall store base matures  the fixed cost component of selling expenses is spread over an increased level of sales  assuming sales increase as stores age  resulting in a decrease in selling and other expenses as a percentage of sales 
fifty two weeks ended january  compared to fifty three weeks ended january  general the fiscal year ended january  consisted of weeks  the fiscal year ended january  consisted of weeks and the fiscal year ended december  consisted of weeks 
sales sales increased to million in from million in wholesale sales  including international operations  increased to million in from million for this growth was achieved primarily by increasing the number of wholesale locations and to a lesser extent by increasing sales to existing locations 
retail sales increased to million in from million for there were retail stores open as of january  compared to stores open at january  the increase in retail sales was achieved primarily through the addition of new stores in and to a lesser extent increased sales in the stores opened in which in were open for less than a full year  partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales 
comparable store and catalog and internet sales in decreased compared to retail comparable store sales in decreased compared to the primary factor contributing to the decrease in comparable store sales was a decline in our retail store traffic 
comparable store sales represent a comparison of the sales  during the corresponding fiscal 
table of contents periods of the two fiscal years compared  of the stores included in our comparable store sales base 
a store first enters our comparable store sales base in the fourteenth fiscal month of operation 
there were stores included in the comparable store base at the end of  and of these stores were included for less than a full year 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in from in the increase in gross profit dollars in compared to was primarily attributable to the increase in sales 
the improvement in gross profit rate in compared to was primarily the result of improved productivity improvements in supply chain operations and the benefit of cost reduction initiatives

as a percentage of sales  selling expenses were in and in the increase in selling expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily related to the new retail stores opened in and the new retails stores opened in these stores are considered immature stores  which are generally stores that are less than three years old 
immature stores typically generate higher selling expenses as a percentage of sales than stores that have been open for more than three years since fixed costs  as a percent of sales  are higher in the early sales maturation period 
the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of sales is also explained by the decrease in retail comparable sales in stores opened prior to and to a decrease in catalog and internet sales 
segment profitability segment profitability is sales less cost of sales and selling expenses 
segment profitability for our wholesale operations  including international operations  was million or of wholesale sales in compared to million or of wholesale sales in segment profitability for our retail operations was million or of retail sales in compared to million or of retail sales in the increase in wholesale segment profitability was primarily attributable to increased wholesale sales and increased wholesale gross profit dollars and rate 
the increase in retail segment profitability in dollars was primarily attributable to increased retail sales and increased gross profit dollars and rate 
the decrease in retail segment profitability as a percentage of retail sales was primarily attributable to decreased profitability in our catalog and internet operations and to a lesser extent decreased profitability in our  square foot south deerfield  massachusetts flagship store 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of personnel related costs  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to from 
the increase in general and administrative expense in dollars in compared to was primarily attributable to labor costs associated with new hires made during and to an increase in stock based compensation expense in compared to the decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales for compared to was primarily due to the company s leveraging of these expenses over a larger sales base 
net other expense net other expense was million in compared to million in the primary component of this expense was interest expense  which was million in compared to million in the average daily debt outstanding increased in compared to primarily due to 
table of contents borrowings associated with repurchases of our common stock 
the impact of the higher average debt outstanding was offset in part by a reduction in borrowing rates under our credit facility

sales sales increased to million in from million in the additional rd week in contributed million and million in retail and wholesale sales  respectively 
wholesale sales  including international operations  increased to million in from million for this growth was achieved primarily by increasing sales to existing customers and to a lesser extent by increasing the number of wholesale locations

comparable store and catalog and internet sales in decreased compared to retail comparable store sales in decreased compared to we believe the primary factor contributing to the decrease in comparable store sales was a decline in store traffic  and mall traffic generally 
comparable store sales were also negatively impacted in due to the president s day february snowstorm which affected most of our store base in the eastern half of the united states and successive weekend snowstorms in early december 
comparable store sales represent a comparison of the sales  during the corresponding fiscal periods of the two fiscal years compared  of the stores included in our comparable store sales base 
a store first enters our comparable store sales base in the fourteenth fiscal month of operation

gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in from in the increase in gross profit dollars in compared to was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and more efficient supply chain operations 
the improvement in gross profit rate in compared to was primarily due to continued productivity improvements in supply chain operations and more efficient sourcing of non manufactured product 

table of contents selling expenses selling expenses increased to million in from million in these expenses are related to both wholesale and retail operations and consist of payroll  occupancy  advertising and other operating costs  as well as preopening costs  which are expensed as incurred 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses were in and in the increase in selling expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily related to the continued growth in the number of retail stores  from as of december  to as of january   the effect of which is an increase in the weighting of immature stores 
immature stores are generally stores that are less than four years old 
immature stores typically generate higher selling expenses as a percentage of sales than stores that have been open for more than four years since fixed costs  as a percent of sales  are higher during the early sales maturation period 
the increase in selling expense as a percentage of sales for is also explained by the decrease in retail comparable store sales since the fixed components of labor and occupancy do not decrease with negative comparable store sales 
selling expenses were also unfavorably impacted by the million bad debt provision the company recognized in the fourth quarter of related to the failure of our former canadian distributor to pay to us amounts due and payable for product shipped 
segment profitability segment profitability is sales less cost of sales and selling expenses 
segment profitability for our wholesale operations  including international operations  was million or of wholesale sales in compared to million or of wholesale sales in segment profitability for our retail operations was million or of retail sales in compared to million or of retail sales in the increase in wholesale segment profitability in dollars was primarily attributable to increased wholesale sales 
the decrease in wholesale segment profitability as a percentage of wholesale sales was primarily due to a million bad debt provision the company recognized in the fourth quarter of related to the failure of our former canadian distributor to pay to us amounts due and payable for product shipped 
the increase in retail segment profitability in dollars and as a percentage of retail sales was primarily attributable to increased retail sales and improved supply chain operations  offset in part by a decrease in retail comparable store sales and the impact of our most immature stores  the and store classes 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of personnel related costs  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to headcount additions in the latter part of and in  consulting costs related to a strategic planning project that began in late february  stock based compensation expense  profit sharing expense and to a lesser extent increased insurance costs associated with the company s directors and officers insurance policy 
in  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
under the prospective transition method selected by us as described in sfas no 
 all stock option grants beginning with grants made in fiscal are being expensed over the vesting period  based on the fair value at the date of the grant 
this resulted in million of incremental stock compensation expense in net other expense net other expense was million in compared to million in the primary component of this expense was interest expense  which was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense in compared to was primarily the result of the reduction in the average daily debt outstanding 

table of contents income taxes the income tax provision for was million compared to million for the and tax provisions resulted in an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
we have provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for our international operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have consistently generated positive cash flow from operations 
specifically  over the last three fiscal years we have generated a total cash flow from operations of approximately million  including approximately million in these amounts have exceeded net income in all the fiscal years presented due primarily to two factors 
first  we have incurred non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
second  income tax expense has significantly exceeded taxes actually paid owing to the tax deduction that we continue to utilize that arose from the recapitalization 
this tax deduction is expected to continue to provide an annual cash benefit for the next nine years 
on an annual basis  this results in tax savings of approximately million per year through assuming sufficient income to realize the full benefit of this deduction 
these internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures for our expansion plans 
on june   we acquired substantially all of the assets of gbi marketing  inc  a privately owned and operated distributor of selected gift products  including yankee candle products  to fundraising organizations 
the total cash purchase price was approximately million 
capital expenditures in were million and were primarily related to the capital requirements to open new stores and investments in manufacturing and logistics operations 
capital expenditures were approximately million in and primarily related to similar expenditures 
we anticipate that capital expenditures in will total approximately million  including approximately million to open a new  square foot flagship store in williamsburg  virginia 
the remaining million is expected to be spent in a similar manner as in we plan to open approximately new stores in  including the williamsburg  virginia flagship store 
on may   we entered into a new million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility with citizens bank of massachusetts and a syndicate of lenders 
this credit facility has two tranches  a million tranche tranche a that expires on may  and a million tranche tranche b that expires on may  the credit facility replaced the million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire on july  this credit facility is being used for  among other things  working capital  letters of credit  repurchase of the our common stock and other general corporate purposes 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to  at the company s option  the citizens bank base rate  or eurodollar rate 
eurodollar borrowings under tranche a of the credit facility include a margin rate ranging from to and borrowings under tranche b include a margin rate ranging from to 
these rates vary depending on the company s outstanding borrowings 
in addition  the company is required to pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee on the unused revolving loan commitment amount 
the commitment fee under tranche a ranges from to and under tranche b ranges from to 
fees for outstanding commercial and standby letters of credit range from to 
the company is also required to pay a utilization fee on the total credit facility of once outstanding borrowings exceed million 
the credit facility requires that the company comply with several financial and other covenants  including requirements that the company maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter the following financial ratios as set forth in the credit facility a consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda ratio of no more than to at january  and for subsequent fiscal quarters at january  this ratio was to 
a fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of the sum of consolidated ebitda plus rent expense  less cash taxes paid and capital expenditures to the sum of consolidated cash interest expense plus rent 
table of contents expense and dividends of no less than to for fiscal  no less than to for fiscal  and no less than to during fiscal and thereafter at january  this ratio was to 
our credit facility defines ebitda as our consolidated net income  plus the amount of net interest expense  depreciation and amortization  income taxes  and certain non cash compensation expenses 
the credit facility permits the payment of cash dividends by the company of up to of the current fiscal year s net income and the repurchase of the company s shares  so long as the company s consolidated net worth as defined in the credit facility is not less than the required amount stated therein 
in order to declare or pay dividends in fiscal  our consolidated net worth must not be less than the sum of million  plus of our fiscal net income  plus of net income for each fiscal quarter thereafter 
our net income for fiscal was million  and of net income was therefore approximately million 
as of january   the company s net worth was approximately million  in excess of the million required under our credit facility for the declaration or payment of dividends 
we anticipate that the company s net worth as of june   the date on which the first semi annual payment is scheduled to be made  will likewise exceed the required amount under our credit facility 
while it is our current intention to pay annual cash dividends in years following  any decision to pay future cash dividends will be made by our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings  financial condition and other factors 
as of january   million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million was outstanding for letters of credit  leaving million in availability 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
in addition to obligations to repay our debt obligations  we lease the majority of our retail stores under long term operating leases 
the following table summarizes our commitments under both our debt and lease obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter debt obligations operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations excludes contractual interest payments due to the fluctuating debt balance and interest rate expected in the future 
includes open purchase orders for goods purchased in the ordinary course of our business  whether or not we are able to cancel such purchase orders 
on february  we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to million of yankee candle common stock 
during fiscal  we repurchased a total of  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
our repurchase activities were funded from cash flow from operations and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
on december   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common stock 
purchase activity under this program commenced on february  we expect that the principal sources of funding for our planned store openings and other working capital needs  capital expenditures  debt service obligations and stock repurchase program will be a combination of our available cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations  and borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and sources of cash will 
table of contents be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next months 
however  there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of cash 
the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and worldwide economic conditions 
in addition  borrowings under our credit facility are dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants contained therein

the provisions of this statement are effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  under the prospective transition method  we have valued all stock option grants beginning with grants made in fiscal these are being expensed over the vesting period based on the fair value at the date of the grant 
accordingly  we will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method commencing with the quarter ending october  for all stock option grants awarded prior to we estimate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in future additional compensation charges of approximately million during fiscal and there will be no impact to cash flow from operations 
the pro forma table in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to stock option grants awarded prior to in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no

fsp clarifies that the manufacturer s deduction provided for under the american jobs creation act of ajca should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas and not as a tax rate reduction 
we have not completed the process of evaluating the impact that will result from adopting this statement and are therefore unable to disclose the impact that adopting fsp will have on our financial position and results of operations

we do not believe adoption of fsp will have a material effect on our financial statements 
impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has a significant impact on our operations 
the prices of our products have not varied based on the movement of the consumer price index 
the majority of our material and labor costs have not been materially affected by inflation 
future operating results as referenced above  there are a number of factors that might cause our actual results to differ significantly from the results reflected by the forward looking statements contained herein 
in addition to factors generally affecting the political  economic and competitive conditions in the united states and abroad  such factors include those set forth below 
if we fail to grow our business as planned  our future operating results may suffer 
as we grow  it will be difficult to maintain our historical growth rates 
we intend to continue to pursue a business strategy of increasing sales and earnings by expanding our retail and wholesale operations both in the united states and internationally 
because our ability to implement our growth strategy successfully will be dependent in part on factors beyond our control  including consumer preferences  macro economic conditions  the competitive environment in the markets in which we compete and other factors  we may not be able to achieve our planned growth or sustain our financial performance 
our ability to anticipate changes in the candle  home fragrance and giftware industries  and identify industry trends  will be critical factors in our ability to grow as planned and remain competitive 
we expect that  as we continue to grow  it will become more difficult to maintain our historical growth rate  which could negatively impact our operating margins and results of operations 
new stores typically generate lower operating margin contributions than mature stores because fixed costs  as a percentage of sales  are higher and because pre opening costs are fully expensed in the year of opening 
in addition  our retail sales generate lower margins than our wholesale sales 
our wholesale business has grown by increasing sales to existing customers and by adding new customers 
if we are not able to continue this  our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
in addition  as we expand our wholesale business into new channels of trade that we believe to be appropriate  sales in some of these new channels may  for competitive reasons within the channels  generate lower margins than do our existing wholesale sales 
similarly  as we continue to broaden our product offerings in order to meet consumer demand  we may do so in part by adding products that  while still very profitable  have lower product margins than those of our extremely profitable core candle products 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to grow at a rate comparable to our historic growth rate or that our historic financial performance will continue as we grow 
we may be unable to continue to open new stores successfully 
our retail growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to successfully open new stores in both existing and new geographic markets 
for our growth strategy to be successful  we must identify and lease favorable store sites on favorable economic terms  hire and train managers and associates and adapt management and operational systems to meet the needs of our expanded operations 
these tasks may be difficult to accomplish successfully 
if we are unable to open new stores as quickly as planned  then our future sales and profits could be materially adversely affected 
even if we succeed in opening new stores  
table of contents these new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores 
also  our retail growth strategy includes opening new stores in markets where we already have a presence so we can take advantage of economies of scale in marketing  distribution and supervision costs  or the opening of new malls or centers n the market 
however  these new stores may result in the loss of sales in existing stores in nearby areas  thereby negatively impacting our comparable store sales 
our retail growth strategy also depends upon our ability to successfully renew the expiring leases of our profitable existing stores 
if we are unable to do so at planned levels and upon favorable economic terms  then our future sales and profits could be negatively affected 
we face significant competition in the giftware industry 
this competition could cause our revenues or margins to fall short of expectations which could adversely affect our future operating results  financial condition and liquidity and our ability to continue to grow our business 
we compete generally for the disposable income of consumers with other producers and retailers in the giftware industry 
the giftware industry is highly competitive with a large number of both large and small participants and relatively low barriers to entry 
our products compete with other scented and unscented candle  home fragrance and personal care products and with other gifts within a comparable price range  like boxes of candy  flowers  wine  fine soap and related merchandise 
our retail stores compete primarily with specialty candle retailers and a variety of other retailers including department stores  gift stores and national specialty retailers that carry candles along with personal care items  giftware and houseware 
in addition  while we focus primarily on the premium scented candle segment  scented and unscented candles are also sold outside of that segment by a variety of retailers including mass merchandisers 
in our wholesale business  we compete with numerous manufacturers and importers of candles  home fragrance products and other home d cor and gift items for the limited space available in our wholesale customer locations for the display and sale of such products to consumers 
some of our competitors are part of large  diversified companies which have greater financial resources and a wider range of product offerings than we do 
many of our competitors source their products from low cost manufacturers outside of the united states 
this competitive environment could adversely affect our future revenues and profits  financial condition and liquidity and our ability to continue to grow our business 
a material decline in consumers discretionary income could cause our sales and income to decline 
our results depend on consumer spending  which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income 
accordingly  we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty like that which followed the september  terrorist attacks on the united states or which result from the threat of war or the possibility of further terrorist attacks 
any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our sales and income 
because we are not a diversified company and are effectively dependent upon one industry  we have less flexibility in reacting to unfavorable consumer trends  adverse economic conditions or business cycles 
we rely primarily on the sale of premium scented candles and related products in the giftware industry 
in the event that sales of these products decline or do not meet our expectations  we cannot rely on the sales of other products to offset such a shortfall 
as a significant portion of our expenses is comprised of fixed costs  such as lease payments  our ability to decrease expenses in response to adverse business conditions is limited in the short term 
as a result  unfavorable consumer trends  adverse economic conditions or changes in the business cycle could have a material and adverse impact on our earnings 
if we lose our senior executive officers  or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business  our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 
our success is substantially dependent upon the retention of our senior executive officers 
if one or more of our senior executive officers become unable or unwilling to participate in our business  our future business and financial performance could be materially affected 
in addition  as our business grows in size 
table of contents and complexity we must be able to continue to attract  develop and retain qualified personnel sufficient to allow us to adequately manage and grow our business 
if we are unable to do so  our operating results could be negatively impacted 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain personnel as and when necessary in the future 
many aspects of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are customized for our business  as a result  the loss of one of these facilities would disrupt our operations 
approximately of our sales in were generated by products we manufacture at our manufacturing facility in whately  massachusetts and we rely primarily on our distribution facilities in south deerfield  massachusetts to distribute our products 
because most of our machinery is designed or customized by us to manufacture our products  and because we have strict quality control standards for our products  the loss of our manufacturing facility  due to natural disaster or otherwise  would materially affect our operations 
similarly  our distribution facilities rely upon customized machinery  systems and operations  the loss of which would materially affect our operations 
although our manufacturing and distribution facilities are adequately insured  we believe it would take up to twelve months to resume operations at a level equivalent to current operations 
seasonal  quarterly and other fluctuations in our business  and general industry and market conditions  could affect the market for our common stock 
our sales and operating results vary from quarter to quarter 
we have historically realized higher sales and operating income in our fourth quarter  particularly in our retail business  which accounts for a larger portion of our sales 
we believe that this has been due primarily to an increase in giftware industry sales during the holiday season of the fourth quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  we may also experience quarterly fluctuations in our sales and income depending on various factors  including  among other things  the number of new retail stores we open in a particular quarter  changes in the ordering patterns of our wholesale customers during a particular quarter  pricing and promotional activities of our competitors  and the mix of products sold 
most of our operating expenses  such as rent expense  advertising and promotional expense and employee wages and salaries  do not vary directly with sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if sales for a particular quarter are below our expectations  we might not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and therefore a sales shortfall could have a disproportionate effect on our operating results for that quarter 
further  our comparable store sales from our retail business in a particular quarter could be adversely affected by competition  the opening nearby of new retail stores or wholesale locations  economic or other general conditions or our inability to execute a particular business strategy 
as a result of these factors  we may report in the future sales  operating results or comparable store sales that do not match the expectations of market analysts and investors 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
public health epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome may affect our operating results 
approximately of our sales in were generated by products  primarily accessories  that we purchased overseas 
substantially all of these products were purchased from east asia 
a sustained interruption of the operations of our suppliers  as a result of the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome or other similar health epidemics  natural disasters such as the tsunami  or other factors could have an adverse effect on our ability to receive timely shipments of certain of our products 

table of contents provisions in our corporate documents and massachusetts law could delay or prevent a change in control of yankee candle 
our articles of organization and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving yankee candle that our stockholders may consider favorable  by authorizing the issuance of preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the board of directors  providing for a classified board of directors  with staggered three year terms  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at meetings 
massachusetts law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
we are subject to a class action lawsuit in california 
a class action lawsuit has been filed against us for alleged violations of certain california state wage and hour and employment laws with respect to certain employees in our california retail stores 
this complaint was filed in february and we have therefore only begun to investigate the allegations and have yet to file our answer 
while we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the allegations  it is too early in the litigation process for us to fully evaluate or predict the outcome of the litigation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  we have debt outstanding 
at january   we had million outstanding under our credit facility  which bears interest at variable rates 
at january   the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 
this facility is intended to fund operating needs and stock repurchases if necessary 
because this facility carries a variable interest rate pegged to market indices  our results of operations and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
based on january  borrowing levels  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have the effect of causing an approximately million additional annual pre tax charge or credit to the statements of income 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash 
this risk impacts fair values  earnings and cash flows 
excess cash is primarily invested in interest bearing accounts that fluctuate with market interest rates 
based on january  cash equivalents  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have the effect of causing an approximately million additional pre tax credit or charge to the annual statements of income 
we buy a variety of raw materials for inclusion in our products 
the only raw material that is considered to be of a commodity nature is wax 
wax is a petroleum based product 
however  its market price has not historically fluctuated with the movement of oil prices and has instead generally moved with inflation 
in  however  significant increases in the price of crude oil resulted in corresponding increases in the price of petroleum based wax 
these crude oil price increases also negatively impacted our transportation costs 
future significant increases in wax prices could have an adverse affect on our cost of goods sold and could lower our margins 
at this point in time  operations outside of the united states are immaterial 
accordingly  we are not exposed to substantial risks arising from foreign currency exchange rates
