our specialty pharmacy services offer payors a cost effective solution for the distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals directly to patients for self administration 
we also provide the direct distribution of biotech pharmaceuticals to physicians offices for in office administration

in addition  we help manage patients conditions through counseling and education regarding their treatment and by providing ongoing monitoring to encourage patient compliance with the prescribed therapy 
we also provide services to help patients receive reimbursement benefits 
physicians we assist physicians with time intensive patient support by providing care management related to their patients pharmacy needs and improving compliance with therapy protocols 
we eliminate the need for physicians to carry inventories of high cost prescriptions by distributing the medications directly to patients homes or  if required  to the physicians offices 
additionally  we either bill the payor directly or assist the patient in the submission of claims to the payor 
pharmaceutical manufacturers we provide pharmaceutical manufacturers with a broad distribution channel for their existing pharmaceuticals and their new product launches 
our team of approximately salespeople helps pharmaceutical manufacturers increase the visibility of their products to prescribing physicians 
we implement patient monitoring programs that encourage compliance with the prescribed therapy 
we also provide valuable clinical information in the form of outcomes and compliance data to support manufacturer research initiatives and reporting requirements 
our company was founded in and was a pioneer in the delivery of home infusion services 
the industry was formed when the technology emerged allowing for the safe and cost effective administration of infused medications in a home environment 
in addition  medicare reimbursement changes in encouraged hospitals to reduce length of stays creating increased discharges to alternate site settings 
during the s  we expanded our services nationally with a franchise model targeting markets with populations of fewer than  we completed our initial public offering on april  and embarked on transitioning the company from a franchise organization to a healthcare services provider through an acquisition program targeting franchised and non affiliated operations 
during the s  we focused on building a leadership position in the home infusion industry and began to leverage our local pharmacy capabilities to distribute niche high cost therapies targeting chronic conditions 
due to the robust biotech pharmaceutical product pipeline  we have seen a significant increase in the distribution of these high cost injectible medications 
as a result  we have created a specialized service offering that meets the needs of patients  product manufacturers and managed care organizations 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol optn 
we are engaged in one reportable industry segment containing three service lines specialty pharmacy  infusion and related healthcare services  and other 
we have one reportable segment with three distinct service lines specialty pharmacy  infusion and related healthcare services and other 
the following table presents summarized information about our revenue by service line for each of the three years ended december  amounts in thousands years ended december  amounts of total amounts of total amounts of total revenue specialty pharmacy infusion and related healthcare services other total revenue industry overview healthcare related expenditures constitute a large and growing segment of the us economy 
according to estimates by the centers for medicare medicaid services  national health expenditures reached an estimated trillion in and are expected to increase to trillion by in  prescription drug expenditures were billion  representing of national healthcare expenditures for that year 
prescription drugs remain among the fastest growing categories of healthcare expenditure  increasing by in we believe the recently enacted medicare prescription  drug  improvement  and modernization act of mpdima should support the viability of option care s specialty pharmacy business 
reimbursement for drugs furnished in connection with durable medical equipment dme continues for and and does not appear to be adversely impacted 
two important trends that impact our business have emerged in relation to healthcare spending 
these trends are positively impacting the growth of many services we provide government programs  private insurance companies  managed care organizations and self insured employers have implemented various cost containment measures to limit the growth of healthcare expenditures 
these cost containment measures  together with technological advances  have resulted in a shift in the delivery of many healthcare services away from traditional hospital settings to more cost effective settings  including patients homes 
as a result of the proliferation of biotech research and development  biotech companies and pharmaceuticals manufacturers have developed a variety of high cost biotech pharmaceuticals 
these biotech pharmaceuticals are most often used in the treatment of chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis  growth hormone disorders  hemophilia  cancer and immune deficiency disorders 
these biotech pharmaceuticals  which in many cases cost over  per patient per year  are typically used on a recurring basis for extended periods of time and require special inventory handling  administration and patient compliance monitoring 
historically  traditional pharmacy distribution channels have not been designed to handle the additional services required by many of these medications 
home infusion pharmacy services home infusion pharmacy services primarily involve the intravenous administration of medications treating a wide range of acute and chronic health conditions 
home infusion pharmacy services are primarily administered to treat infections  dehydration  cancer  pain and nutritional deficiencies 
patients are generally referred to home infusion pharmacy services providers by physicians  hospital discharge planners and case managers 
the medications are mixed and dispensed under the supervision of a registered pharmacist and the therapy is typically delivered in the home of the patient by a registered nurse or trained caregiver 
depending on the preferences of the patient and or the payor  these services may also be provided at a local ambulatory infusion center 
according to the national home infusion association  the size of the home infusion pharmacy services industry is currently between and billion 
we believe that several factors will contribute to the continuing growth in non hospital based infusion therapy services  including the following healthcare cost containment pressures  increased number of therapies that can be safely administered in patients homes  patient preference for at home treatment  increased acceptance of home infusion by the medical community and by managed care organizations and other payors  technological innovations such as implantable injection ports  vascular access devices and portable infusion control devices  increase utilization of home infusion therapies due to demographic trends  in particular increasing life expectancies 
specialty pharmacy services specialty pharmacy services involve the distribution of injectible and infused pharmaceuticals  as well as related support services  for patients with chronic health conditions 
these pharmaceuticals can be directly distributed to the patient or to the patient s physician for in office administration and in many cases cost over  per patient per year 
these pharmaceuticals may require refrigeration during shipping as well as special handling to prevent potency degradation 
patients receiving treatment usually require special counseling and education regarding their condition and treatment programs 
the specialty pharmacy services industry primarily treats conditions such as multiple sclerosis  growth hormone disorders  hemophilia  cancer  immune deficiency disorders  asthma and other chronic conditions 
retail pharmacies and other traditional distributors generally are designed to carry inventories of low cost  high volume products and therefore are not equipped to handle the high cost  low volume specialty pharmaceuticals that have specialized requirements 
as a result  these pharmaceuticals are generally provided by pharmacies that focus primarily on filling  labeling and delivering specialty pharmaceuticals and related support services 
depending on therapy  specialty pharmaceuticals may be administered at the patient s home  a physician s office or at an ambulatory infusion center 
the us market for specialty pharmaceuticals is estimated to be approximately billion and is growing rapidly 
we expect several factors to contribute to the continuing growth of the specialty pharmacy services industry  including the following healthcare cost containment pressures  development of new pharmaceuticals  direct to consumer advertising  increased acceptance of mail order distribution  and growing emphasis on care management and compliance monitoring to improve outcomes for these high cost  chronic diseases 
our strategy we leverage our years of clinical experience  the wide geographical coverage of our two central high volume distribution facilities and company owned locations and franchise locations  as well as our flexible distribution model which includes the delivery of our services to patients homes  physicians offices or our local ambulatory infusion centers  to make us an attractive provider to managed care organizations  insurance companies and other third party payors and referral sources seeking a single source for infusion pharmacy services and specialty pharmacy services 
we intend to increase our revenue and profitability by implementing the following strategies infusion pharmacy growth strategy we intend to strengthen our position as the leading national provider of infusion therapy by investing in sales execution to new and existing referral sources and through selective acquisitions and start ups that expand our geographic coverage into new markets and consolidate providers in existing markets that we serve 
specialty pharmacy growth strategies we have two strategies to providing specialty pharmacy services manufacturer strategy we intend to expand our relationships with biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers in order to acquire distribution rights to existing and new products by providing centralized distribution  patient compliance programs  patient reimbursement support and clinical data 
to support our operations and enhance the services provided under our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers  we maintain a national specialty care pharmacy in ann arbor  michigan to provide a central distribution channel for certain specialty pharmaceuticals 
managed care strategy we currently have contracts with most major managed care organizations  which cover approximately million lives 
we are actively implementing contracts for additional services with existing payors as well as new managed care relationships 
we intend to expand existing relationships and enter into new relationships with managed care organizations to lower the cost of physician office based biotech pharmaceuticals and provide utilization and outcomes data 
our specialty pharmacy in miramar  florida serves as a central management and distribution point for delivery of biotech pharmaceuticals to physician offices 
acquisition strategy the home infusion industry is highly fragmented with the majority of service providers operating primarily in local or regional markets 
currently  there are approximately  home infusion providers operating in the united states are small  mom and pop operations while the remaining include a variety of local and national providers that are either independent pharmacies or hospital affiliated 
we believe that few competitors possess the scale and resources to consolidate the industry and that our financial resources and operating strength give us an advantage in this area 
additionally  our franchise network provides us with a built in pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities 
our typical franchise agreement provides us with a right of first refusal for the potential acquisition of an existing franchise

left untreated  hepatitis c virus can cause serious liver damage 
treatment includes injections of interferon alfa products  which are proteins that boost the body s immune system 
treatment can last up to months 
multiple sclerosis a chronic  incurable  progressive disease of the central nervous system 
the goal of treatment is to decrease the severity  intensity and duration of outbreaks and to slow the progression of the disease 
treatment regimens involve pharmaceutical injections  and products vary widely 
hemophilia an inherited bleeding disorder that is caused by a blood clotting deficiency that results in a longer bleeding time 
hemophilia is one of the most costly diseases to treat 
the treatment goal is to raise the level of the deficient clotting factor and maintain it in order to stop the bleeding 
treatments include infusion of the clotting factor products 
the length of treatment depends on the severity of the bleeding episode  and the need for treatment continues throughout the life of the patient 
immune deficiency immune deficiencies are disorders which reduce the patient s ability to identify and destroy substances which do not belong in the human body and are characterized by reduced levels of antibodies 
intravenous immune globulins  which are infused to treat the immune deficiencies  are concentrated antibodies that have been purified from large numbers of human blood donors 
cancer includes a wide spectrum of tumors  abnormal growths and cellular abnormalities

one of the specialty pharmaceuticals that we distribute  synagis  is a preventive drug used to protect high risk pediatric patients against respiratory synctial virus rsv 
treatments typically consist of monthly synagis injections during the rsv season  which lasts from approximately october through april 
our quarterly revenue from sales of synagis in and was as follows amounts in thousands q q q q q q q q synagis revenue percent of total revenue other revenue sources franchise royalties and related fees we generate royalty revenue and related fees from our network of option care franchised locations 
as of december   we have a network of franchise locations operating under separate franchise agreements throughout the united states 
software license  rental and support our subsidiary  management by information  inc mbi  licenses  sells and supports proprietary software products created and designed for the home infusion pharmacy industry 
their products include an older  dos based product  as well as a new  browser based product named iemphsys 
vendor rebates and administration fees through the combined purchasing power of our company owned and franchised locations  we are able to sign pharmaceutical purchase contracts with manufacturers and other vendors that provide us the opportunity to earn volume purchase rebates and vendor administration fees 
such fees are recorded as revenue to the extent that they are earned based on the purchase volume of our franchised locations 
billing significant payors we derive most of our revenue from contracts with third party payors  such as managed care organizations  insurance companies  self insured employers and medicare and medicaid programs 
where permissible  we bill patients for any amounts not reimbursed by third party payors 
for the most part  our infusion pharmacy revenue consists of reimbursement for both the cost of the pharmaceuticals sold and the cost of services provided 
pharmaceuticals are typically reimbursed on a percentage discount from the published average wholesale price awp of each drug  while certain nursing and other patient support services and ancillary medical supplies are reimbursed separately or on a per diem basis  where applicable 
specialty pharmaceuticals are typically pre packaged drugs that are self injected by the patient or a trained in home caregiver 
therefore  minimal service is provided and no per diem revenue is generated 
our principal managed care contract is with blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc bc bs of florida 
we provide infusion pharmacy and specialty pharmacy services to bc bs of florida members throughout the state of florida 
this contract renews annually each september for an additional one year term  if not terminated by either party upon days notice 
for the year  our contract with bc bs of florida produced million in revenue 
in  and  respectively  approximately  and of our total revenue was related to this contract 
as of december  and  approximately and of option care s accounts receivable were from bc bs of florida 
we also provide services that are reimbursable through government healthcare programs such as medicare and state medicaid programs 
for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively  approximately  and of our revenue came from government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
the accounts receivable related to these programs represented approximately and of our total accounts receivable  respectively  as of december  and we bill payors and track all of our accounts receivable through computerized billing systems 
the majority of our company owned pharmacies utilize software that was developed by our subsidiary  management by information  inc mbi 
this software allows our billing staff the flexibility to review and edit claims in the system before they are submitted to payors 
claims are submitted to payors either electronically or through the mail 
we utilize electronic claim submission whenever possible to expedite claim review and payment  and to minimize errors and omissions 
the net revenue that we report is based on usual and customary billing rates for the products and services we provide  less applicable contractual adjustments 
in most cases  our computerized billing systems generate contractual adjustments based on the fee schedules of the underlying insurance contracts when the claims are billed 
if our computerized billing systems cannot automatically generate the contractual adjustment for a given claim  we calculate the contractual adjustment manually and key the adjustment into our billing system when the claim is billed 
for revenue that is not yet billed  we manually estimate the contractual adjustments using a claim by claim analysis of the unbilled charges  by applying historic contractual adjustment percentages  or a combination of the two methods 
we generate accounts receivable aging reports from our mbi software and all the other billing systems that we use 
we utilize these reports to help us monitor the condition of our outstanding receivables and evaluate the performance of our billing and reimbursement staff 
we also utilize these aging reports  combined with historic write off statistics generated from our billing systems  to determine our required level of bad debt reserves 
our financial performance is highly dependent upon effective billing and collection practices at each of our company owned pharmacies 
the process begins with an accurate and complete patient admission process  in which all critical information about the patient  the patient s insurance and their care needs is gathered 
a critical part of this process is verification of insurance coverage and authorization from insurance to provide the required care  which typically takes place before we initiate services 
the only exception occurs when a patient referral is received outside of normal business hours  but we have an existing contractual relationship with the patient s insurance carrier 
in such cases  we provide the patient with sufficient drugs and services to last until the next business day  when the patient s insurance coverage can be verified 
franchise program our franchise program was developed to increase our geographical presence and to provide a national network of pharmacies to service the needs of our managed care customers without requiring extensive capital expenditures 
in marketing our franchise program  we target independent infusion pharmacies that would benefit from participating in our national and regional managed care and manufacturer contracts as well as in our marketing programs 
our franchised locations are given a license to operate an option care branded pharmacy in a defined territory to provide infusion therapy and related products and services 
we receive a start up fee upon execution of the franchise agreement with subsequent royalties based on a percentage of gross receipts of the franchised location 
each franchisee is required to maintain a licensed pharmacy equipped to compound medications in a sterile environment as prescribed by physicians 
in the program that we are currently marketing  the franchisee must use our proprietary software and obtain specified liability insurance protecting the franchise owner and us against claims arising from the operation of the franchised business 
the franchisees may participate in our managed care and manufacturer contracts 
our franchisees may also purchase pharmaceuticals and supplies from a preferred list of vendors under contract with us 
this frequently allows us and the franchisee to obtain volume discount pricing 
most of our franchise agreements also provide us with a right of first refusal for the potential acquisition of the franchise 
however  none of our current agreements grants us the option to purchase the franchise at our will 
as of december   we had franchised pharmacy locations operating under separate franchise agreements 
approximately of our franchise agreements come up for renewal in the four year period from through as franchise agreements near expiration  we expect to propose new agreements to maintain the network 
if we cannot reach agreement with the franchisee and the franchise expires  the franchisee is required to cease using the option care trademark and will not be able to access our managed care agreements or purchasing contracts 
we would then be free to re franchise the territory or to service the territory with a company owned facility 
the following table summarizes the termination dates of our franchise agreements  by year  and presents the percentage of our royalty revenue attributable to franchises terminating in each year year ended december  number of franchise agreements expiring percent of royalty revenue includes st 
cloud  mn franchise  which we acquired on february  to facilitate our specialty pharmacy services  we have entered into participation agreements with of our franchised pharmacy locations 
of the franchisees that have signed participation agreements  are actively providing specialty pharmacy services 
the participation agreements provide that we will pay a fee to the franchisee if we sell selected specialty pharmacy services in that franchisee s territory  and also provide for a reduced royalty rate on related sales of specialty pharmaceuticals made by the franchisee 
we continue to offer participation agreements to selected franchisees 
the franchise program that we are currently marketing specifically provides for specialty pharmacy sales and related services by us in the franchised territory 
proprietary data management system our wholly owned subsidiary  management by information  inc mbi  has developed proprietary software systems designed to manage the intake  dispensing  clinical  billing and collection processes for home infusion pharmacies 
these products also contain a component for managing the clinical  billing  and inventory tracking functions for respiratory therapy durable medical equipment rt dme businesses 
we license and service our software systems to non affiliated home infusion pharmacy and durable medical equipment companies  and to several of our franchisees 
we also use mbi s systems internally to manage the operations of the majority of our company owned local pharmacies and rt dme businesses 
mbi has completed development of the next generation of its software product a scalable  browser based system named iemphsys and began marketing the software to third party customers in as of december   we are utilizing iemphsys in seven of our company owned pharmacies and are planning to install iemphsys in all of our company owned pharmacies 
this software is currently being marketed as a stand alone product to be utilized on a local area network 
we are continuing to enhance the product to improve upon its capabilities 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing efforts focus on three primary objectives building new relationships and expanding existing contracts with managed care organizations  establishing  maintaining and strengthening relationships with local and regional patient referral sources  and maintaining existing and developing new relationships with biotech drug manufacturers to gain distribution access as they release new products 
our national and regional sales directors focus primarily on establishing and expanding our contracts with managed care organizations  while our local account managers focus on pull through from these contracts by developing and maintaining relationships with local and regional referral sources  such as physicians  hospital discharge planners and case managers 
in addition  we have a sales force focused on maintaining and expanding our relationships with biotech drug manufacturers to establish our position as a participating provider when they release new products 
most new patients are referred to us by physicians  medical groups  hospital discharge planners  case managers employed by health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos or other managed care organizations  insurance companies and home care agencies 
our sales force is responsible for establishing and maintaining these referral relationships 
our sales structure allows us to take advantage of our national managed care relationships to provide sales and contract pull through by our local field based sales personnel 
additionally  the existence of our contracts with national managed care organizations provides our local sales personnel with more flexibility and leverage for sales in local markets 
this cross utility enables us to market our services to numerous sources of patient referrals  including physicians  hospital discharge planners  hospital personnel  hmos  ppos or other managed care organizations  and insurance companies 
local marketing focuses on our infusion pharmacy business and our care management programs  with an emphasis on certain key therapies 
competition our pharmacies compete in the large and highly fragmented home infusion and specialty pharmacy markets 
we compete for contracts with managed care organizations and other third party payors and compete to receive referrals from physicians  case managers and hospital discharge planners 
competition in the home infusion market is based on quality of care  cost of service and reputation 
competition in the specialty pharmacy market is based on price  reliability of service and reputation 
some of our existing and potential competitors in the home infusion market include integrated home healthcare providers such as apria healthcare group inc and coram healthcare corporation  and local providers of alternate site healthcare services such as hospitals  local home health agencies and other local providers 
in the specialty pharmacy market  our existing and potential competitors include specialty pharmacy providers such as accredo health inc  caremark rx  priority healthcare corporation and others  specialized retail pharmacies such as pharmacare  a division of cvs corporation  pharmacy benefit management companies  wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
in each market  some of these current competitors have  and our potential future competitors may have  greater financial  operational  sales and marketing resources than us 
however  we believe that our reputation for providing quality services  the strength of our growing national presence and our ability to effectively market our services at national  regional and local levels places us in a strong position against existing and potential competitors 
we also believe that our dual presence in the local infusion pharmacy market and the national specialty pharmacy market provide synergies and make us more appealing to the managed care community than the majority of our competitors 
governmental regulation the healthcare industry is subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental entities at the federal  state and local level 
the industry is also subject to frequent regulatory change 
laws and regulations in the healthcare industry are extremely complex and  in many instances  the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation 
moreover  our business is impacted not only by those laws and regulations that are directly applicable to us but also by certain laws and regulations that are applicable to our managed care and other clients 
if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations directly applicable to our business  we could suffer civil and or criminal penalties  and we could be excluded from participating in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs  which would have an adverse impact on our business 
if our franchisees fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to their businesses  they could suffer civil and or criminal penalties and or be excluded from participating in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
the healthcare industry is undergoing significant change as third party payors  such as medicare and medicaid  health maintenance organizations and other health insurance carriers increase efforts to control the cost  utilization and delivery of healthcare services 
reductions in reimbursement by medicare and medicaid and other third party payors may be implemented from time to time 
these cost control efforts may result in a decline in the prices for which we are able to sell our products and services  which would have an adverse effect on our gross profit margins and overall profitability 
professional licensure 
nurses  pharmacists and certain other healthcare professionals employed by us are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state law 
we perform criminal and other background checks on employees and take steps to ensure that our employees possess all necessary licenses and certifications  and we believe that our employees comply in all material respects with applicable licensure laws 
each of our franchisees is responsible for ensuring the licensing or certification of its employees in accordance with applicable law  performing any criminal or other background checks required by state law  and ensuring that all employees perform only those tasks which fall within their authorized scope of practice 
while each franchisee is responsible for any failure or non compliance with respect to these licensure and scope of practice issues  any such failure or non compliance by a franchisee that impacts such franchisee s operations could have an adverse effect on our business 
pharmacy licensing and registration 
state laws require that each of our pharmacy locations be licensed as an in state pharmacy to dispense pharmaceuticals in that state 
certain states also require that our pharmacy locations be licensed as an out of state pharmacy if we deliver prescription pharmaceuticals into those states from locations outside of the state 
we believe that we substantially comply with all state licensing laws applicable to our business 
if we are unable to maintain our licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on non resident pharmacies  our ability to operate in some states would be limited  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
laws enforced by the drug enforcement administration  as well as some similar state agencies  require our pharmacy locations to individually register in order to handle controlled substances  including prescription pharmaceuticals 
a separate registration is required at each principal place of business where we dispense controlled substances 
federal and state laws also require that we follow specific labeling  reporting and record keeping requirements for controlled substances 
we maintain federal and state controlled substance registrations for each of our facilities that require such registration and follow procedures intended to comply with all applicable federal and state requirements regarding controlled substances 
many states in which we operate also require home infusion companies to be licensed as home health agencies 
we believe we are in compliance with these laws as applicable 
food  drug and cosmetic act 
certain provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act govern the handling and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
this law exempts many pharmaceuticals and medical devices from federal labeling and packaging requirements as long as they are not adulterated or misbranded and are dispensed in accordance with and pursuant to a valid prescription 
to the extent that this law applies to us  we believe that we comply with all applicable requirements 
fraud and abuse laws anti kickback statute 
the federal anti kickback statute prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully paying  offering  receiving  or soliciting money or anything else of value in order to induce the referral of patients or to induce a person to purchase  lease  order  arrange for  or recommend services or goods covered by medicare  medicaid  or other government healthcare programs 
the federal courts have held that an arrangement violates the anti kickback statute if any one purpose of the remuneration is to induce the referral of patients covered by the medicare or medicaid programs  even if another purpose of the payment is to compensate an individual for rendered services 
the anti kickback statute is extremely broad and potentially covers many standard business arrangements 
violations can lead to significant penalties  including criminal fines of up to  per violation and or five years imprisonment  civil monetary penalties of up to  per violation plus treble damages  and or exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid  and other federal government healthcare programs 
in an effort to clarify the conduct prohibited by the anti kickback statute  the office of the inspector general oig of the united states department of health and human services has published regulations that identify a limited number of safe harbors 
business arrangements that satisfy all of the elements of a safe harbor are immune from criminal enforcement or civil administrative actions 
the anti kickback statute is an intent based statute and the failure of a business relationship to satisfy all of the elements of a safe harbor does not in and of itself mean that the business relationship violates the anti kickback statute 
the oig  in its commentary to the safe harbor regulations  has recognized that many business arrangements that do not satisfy a safe harbor nonetheless operate without the type of abuses the anti kickback statute is designed to prevent 
we attempt to structure our business relationships to satisfy an applicable safe harbor 
however  in those situations where a business relationship does not fully satisfy the elements of a safe harbor  or where no safe harbor exists  we attempt to satisfy as many elements of an applicable safe harbor as possible 
the oig is authorized to issue advisory opinions regarding the interpretation and applicability of the anti kickback statute  including whether an activity constitutes grounds for the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions 
we have not  however  sought any opinions regarding our business relationships 
a number of states have in place statutes and regulations that prohibit the same general types of conduct as those prohibited by the anti kickback statute described above 
some state anti fraud and anti kickback laws apply only to goods and services covered by medicaid 
other state anti fraud and anti kickback laws apply to all healthcare goods and services  regardless of whether the source of payment is governmental or private 
where applicable  we attempt to structure our business relationships to comply with these statutes 
fraud and abuse laws false claims act 
we are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement 
these laws generally prohibit an individual or entity from knowingly and willfully presenting a claim or causing a claim to be presented for payment from a federal healthcare program that is false or fraudulent 
the standard for knowing and willful may include conduct that amounts to a reckless disregard for the accuracy of information presented to payors 
penalties under these statutes include substantial civil and criminal fines  exclusion from the medicare or medicaid programs and imprisonment 
one of the most prominent of these laws is the federal false claims act  which may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a private plaintiff by filing a qui tam lawsuit on the government s behalf 
under the false claims act  the government and private plaintiffs  if any  may recover monetary penalties in the amount of  to  per false claim  as well as an amount equal to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government as a result of the false claim 
a number of states  including states in which we operate  have adopted their own false claims statutes as well as statutes that allow individuals to bring qui tam actions 
we believe that we have procedures in place to ensure the accuracy of our claims 
the federal false claims act has been invoked in circumstances where there are claims submitted which violate the stark law described below 
in recent years  federal and state government agencies have increased the level of enforcement resources and activities targeted at the healthcare industry 
in addition  the use of private qui tam enforcement actions against healthcare providers has increased dramatically in recent years 
ethics in patient referrals law stark law 
the federal stark law generally prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain designated health services dhs  reimbursable by medicare or medicaid  to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship  unless an exception applies 
a financial relationship is generally defined as an ownership  investment or compensation relationship 
the first version of the stark law  which prohibited physicians from ordering only clinical laboratory services for medicare patients from an entity with which the physician had a financial relationship  is often referred to as stark i 
the expansion of the stark law to include other dhs is often referred to as stark ii 
dhs under stark ii now include  but are not limited to  outpatient pharmaceuticals  parenteral and enteral nutrition products  home health services  durable medical equipment  physical and occupational therapy services  and inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
among other sanctions  a civil monetary penalty of up to  may be imposed for each bill or claim for a service a person knows or should know is for a service for which payment may not be made due to the stark law 
such persons or entities are also subject to exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
any person or entity participating in a circumvention scheme to avoid the referral prohibitions is liable for a civil monetary penalty of up to  a  fine may be imposed for failure to comply with reporting requirements regarding an entity s ownership  investment and compensation arrangements for each day for which reporting is required to have been made under the stark law 
the stark law exempts certain business relationships that meet its exception requirements 
however  unlike the anti kickback statute under which an activity may fall outside a safe harbor and still be lawful  a referral for dhs that does not fall within an exception is strictly prohibited by the stark law 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms has issued regulations addressing the stark law s prohibition on referrals for dhs and many of the available exceptions 
many of the phase i regulations became effective on january  and the phase ii regulations became effective on july  we attempt to structure all of our relationships with physicians who make referrals to us in compliance with an applicable exception to the stark law 
in addition to the stark law  many of the states in which we and our franchisees operate have comparable restrictions on the ability of physicians to refer patients for certain services to entities with which they have a financial relationship 
certain of these state statutes mirror the stark law while others may be more restrictive 
we attempt to structure all of our business relationships with physicians to comply with any applicable state self referral laws 
health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  public law  included administrative simplification provisions that required the department of health and human services hhs to adopt national standards for electronic health care transactions 
at the same time  congress recognized that advances in electronic technology could erode the privacy of health information 
consequently  congress incorporated provisions into hipaa that mandated the adoption of federal privacy protections for individually identifiable health information 
in response to the hipaa mandate  in december  hhs published a final regulation in the form of the privacy rule  which became effective on april  this privacy rule set national standards for the protection of health information  as applied to the three types of covered entities health plans  health care clearinghouses  and health care providers who conduct certain health care transactions electronically 
in march  hhs published proposed modifications to the privacy rule  to improve workability and avoid unintended consequences that could have impeded patient access to delivery of quality health care 
following another round of public comment  in august  hhs adopted final modifications necessary to ensure that the privacy rule worked as intended 
pursuant to the privacy rule  as of april   covered entities were required to have standards in place to protect and guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information 
small health plans had until april  to implement such standards 
failure to timely implement these standards may  under certain circumstances  trigger the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
the privacy rule establishes a foundation of federal protections for the privacy of protected health information 
the privacy rule does not replace federal  state  or other laws that grant individuals even greater privacy protections  and covered entities are free to retain or adopt more protective policies or practices 
we have implemented the standards set forth in the privacy rule  and these standards were in place on april  we believe that we and all of our franchisees are in compliance with the privacy rule or any more stringent federal or state laws relating to privacy 
additionally  the administrative simplification provisions address electronic health care transactions and the security of electronic health information systems 
providers are required to comply with the standards by specific compliance dates established by hhs 
for standards relating to electronic health care transactions  the compliance date was originally set for october  if the covered entity filed for an extension  the compliance date was postponed until october  we were materially compliant with these standards by the applicable compliance date 
the security standards applicable to individually identifiable health information maintained electronically must be implemented by april  the standards for a unique national health identifier for providers used in connection with the electronic healthcare transactions must be implemented by may  we expect to be able to materially comply with these regulations by their applicable compliance dates 
penalties for non compliance with the privacy rule and other hipaa administrative simplification provisions range from a civil penalty of for each violation which can total up to  per person per year  to criminal penalties  including up to  and or one year imprisonment  up to  and or five years imprisonment if the offense is committed under false pretenses and up to  and or ten years imprisonment for violating a standard with the intent to sell  transfer or use individually identifiable health information for commercial advantage  personal gain or malicious harm 
in addition to regulating privacy of individual health information and other provisions relating to administrative simplification  hipaa includes several anti fraud and abuse laws  extends criminal penalties to private health care benefit programs and  in addition to medicare and medicaid  to other federal health care programs  and expands the office of inspector general s authority to exclude persons and entities from participating in the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of changed the way in which covered outpatient drugs are reimbursed by the medicare program 
in january  payment for most drugs covered by medicare decreased to of the average wholesale price awp determined as of april  beginning in  reimbursement for most medicare part b drugs not paid on a cost or prospective payment basis will be set at either of the average sales price asp or through a competitive acquisition program to be phased in beginning in the competitive acquisition program will be established by cms and will enable physicians in designated competitive acquisition areas to purchase drugs through contractors that have successfully bid for that right 
each physician will elect annually whether to obtain drugs through the competitive acquisition program 
cms will re bid the contracts at least every three years 
a significant part of the infusion drugs provided by our company are administered in connection with covered durable medical equipment dme 
the payment rate for drugs administered in this manner generally will continue to be of the awp in effect as of october  while the majority of our revenue is reimbursed by managed care organizations and other non government payors  these changes to the way medicare pays for outpatient drugs and biologicals may reduce our revenue and gross margins on services provided to medicare patients 
further  adoption of asp as the standard measure for determining reimbursement by state medicaid programs for the drugs we provide may reduce our revenue and gross margins 
balanced budget act 
each state operates a medicaid program funded in part by the federal government 
the states may customize their programs within federal limitations 
each state program has its own payment formula and recipient eligibility criteria 
in recent years  changes in medicare and medicaid programs have resulted in limitations on  and reduced levels of  payment and reimbursement for a substantial portion of health care goods and services 
for example  the federal balanced budget act of  even after the restoration of some funding in and  will continue to cause significant reductions in spending levels for the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicaid reimbursement is at extremely low levels in some states 
we carefully monitor state medicaid reimbursement  and while we aggressively pursue managed care and other non government payors  cutbacks in state medicaid reimbursements could potentially have a significant impact on us or our franchisees 
franchise regulation 
we are subject to regulations adopted by the federal trade commission ftc  and to certain state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises 
the ftc franchise rule disclosure requirements and prohibitions concerning franchising and business opportunity ventures and certain state laws require that we furnish prospective franchise owners with a uniform franchise offering circular ufoc containing information prescribed by the ftc franchise rule and applicable state laws and regulations 
there are certain states that also regulate the offer and sale of franchises and  in almost all cases  require registration of the ufoc with state authorities 
we are also subject to a number of state laws that regulate some substantive aspects of the franchisor franchisee relationship 
these laws may limit a franchisor s ability to terminate or not renew a franchise without good cause  interfere with the right of free association among franchise owners  disapprove the transfer of a franchise  discriminate among franchisees regarding charges  royalties and other fees  and place new facilities near existing franchisees 
these laws also may limit the duration and scope of non competition provisions 
to date  these laws have not precluded us from seeking franchisees in any given area and have not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
although bills intended to regulate certain aspects of franchise relationships have been introduced into congress on several occasions during the past decade  none have been enacted 
we are not aware of any pending franchise legislation that in our view is likely to significantly affect our operations 
we believe that our operations comply substantially with the ftc franchise rule and applicable state franchise laws 
service marks we have registered with the federal government option care  optionmed  mbi and iemphsys among others  as service marks 
we believe that option care is becoming increasingly recognized by many referral sources as representing a reliable  cost effective source of pharmacy services 
we believe that the use of these service marks does not violate or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others 
insurance our business may subject us to litigation and liability for damages 
we currently maintain insurance for general and professional liability claims in the amount of million per claim and million in aggregate per policy year  plus million in umbrella coverage 
accordingly  the maximum coverage for a first claim in any policy year is million  and the maximum aggregate coverage for all claims in a policy year is million 
we also require each franchisee to maintain general liability and professional liability insurance covering both the franchise and us  at coverage levels that we believe to be sufficient 
these policies provide coverage on a claims made or occurrence basis and have certain exclusions from coverage 
these insurance policies generally must be renewed annually 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liability claims that may be asserted against us 
professional liability insurance costs have increased significantly in recent years  and the number of insurance carriers willing to write professional liability insurance policies for healthcare providers has declined 
there can be no assurance that adequate insurance will be available in the future at acceptable cost  if at all 
to the extent that liability insurance is not adequate to cover liability claims against us  we will be responsible for the excess 
a claim  or claims  in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
employees as of december   we employed  persons on a full time basis and persons on a part time basis 
of our full time employees  were corporate management and administrative personnel and the remaining  were employees of company owned locations  primarily in clinical  management and administrative positions 
we believe our employee relations are good 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we describe below  together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form k and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
some of the following factors relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate 
other factors relate principally to an investment in our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could develop 
other risks and uncertainties that we have not predicted or evaluated could also adversely affect our company 
if any of the following risks occur  our earnings  financial condition or business could be materially harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our revenue and profitability will decline if the pharmaceutical industry undergoes certain changes  including limiting or discontinuing research  development  production and marketing of the pharmaceuticals that are compatible with the services we provide 
our business is highly dependent on the ability of biotech and other pharmaceutical companies to develop  supply and market pharmaceuticals that are compatible with the services we provide 
our revenue and profitability will decline if those companies were to sell pharmaceuticals directly to the public or fail to support existing pharmaceuticals or develop new pharmaceuticals 
our business could also be harmed if the pharmaceutical industry experiences any of the following developments supply shortages  pharmaceutical recalls  an inability to finance product development because of capital shortages  a decline in product research  development or marketing  a reduction in the retail price of pharmaceuticals  changes in the fda approval process  or government or private initiatives that alter how pharmaceutical manufacturers  health care providers or pharmacies promote or sell products and services 
if we lose relationships with managed care organizations and other non governmental third party payors  we could lose access to a significant number of patients and our revenue and margins could decline 
we are highly dependent on reimbursement from managed care organizations and other non governmental third party payors 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively   and of our revenue came from managed care organizations and other non governmental payors  including self pay patients 
many payors seek to limit the number of providers that supply pharmaceuticals to their enrollees in order to build volume that justifies their discounted pricing 
from time to time  payors with whom we have relationships require that we bid against our competitors to keep their business 
as a result of such bidding process  we may not be retained  and even if we are retained  the prices at which we are able to retain the business may be reduced 
the loss of a payor relationship could significantly reduce the number of patients we serve and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and net income  and a reduction in pricing could reduce our margins and our net income 
the loss of our contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida would materially decrease our revenue 
our principal managed care contract is with blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively   and of our revenue was related to this contract 
the contract is terminable by either party on days notice and  unless terminated  renews annually each september for an additional one year term 
the loss of this contract  or a material reduction in our pricing or pharmaceutical sales under this contract  would materially decrease our revenue and net income 
recent legislation changing the way medicare reimburses healthcare providers for covered outpatient drugs  or other future changes to the scope or method of reimbursement from medicare or medicaid  could cause our revenue and gross profit margin to decline 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively   and of our revenue came from reimbursement by federal and state programs such as medicare and medicaid 
reimbursement from these and other government programs is subject to statutory and regulatory requirements  administrative rulings  interpretations of policy  implementation of reimbursement procedures  retroactive payment adjustments  governmental funding restrictions and changes to or new legislation  all of which may materially affect the amount and timing of reimbursement payments to us 
in particular  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of changed the way in which medicare reimburses providers for covered outpatient drugs 
in january  payment for most drugs covered by medicare decreased to of the average wholesale price awp determined as of april  beginning in  reimbursement for most medicare part b drugs not paid on a cost or prospective payment basis will be set at either of the average sales price asp or through a competitive acquisition program to be phased in beginning in a significant part of the infusion drugs provided by our company are administered in connection with covered durable medical equipment dme 
the payment rate for drugs administered in this manner generally will continue to be of the awp in effect as of october  while the majority of our revenue is reimbursed by managed care organizations and other non government payors  these changes to the way medicare pays for outpatient drugs and biologicals may reduce our revenue and gross margins on services provided to medicare patients 
further  adoption of asp as the standard measure for determining reimbursement by state medicaid programs for the drugs we provide may reduce our revenue and gross margins 
in addition  budgetary concerns in many states have resulted in and may continue to result in  reductions to medicaid reimbursement as well as delays in payment of outstanding claims 
any reductions to or delays in collecting amounts reimbursable by government programs for our products or services or changes in regulations governing such reimbursements could cause our revenue and profitability to decline 
our margins could decrease if there are changes in the calculation of average wholesale price awp for the pharmaceuticals we sell  or if managed care organizations and other private payors replace average wholesale price with a different reimbursement system 
our gross profit is largely controlled by our ability to purchase pharmaceutical products at discounted prices and to negotiate profitable managed care contracts 
in many cases  we purchase pharmaceuticals at less than the published awp for those pharmaceuticals 
the awp has been a standard form of pricing often used in the healthcare industry to determine discount and reimbursement amounts 
accordingly  we have contracted with a number of private payors to sell pharmaceuticals at awp or at a percentage discount off of the awp 
awp for most pharmaceuticals is compiled and published by private companies  including first databank  inc a reduction in awp for the products we provide to patients could reduce our revenue and narrow our gross profit margins 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of will result in the replacement of awp with asp as the standard measure for determining medicare reimbursement for certain covered outpatient drugs 
the adoption of asp or any other measure for determining reimbursement by some or all of the managed care or other private payors with whom we contract could have a significant impact on our future revenue  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to pricing pressures and other risks involved with third party payors 
in recent years  competition for patients  efforts by traditional third party payors to contain or reduce healthcare costs  and the increasing influence of managed care payors  such as health maintenance organizations  have resulted in reduced rates of reimbursement 
changes in reimbursement policies of governmental third party payors  including policies relating to medicare  medicaid and other federal and state funded programs  could reduce the amounts reimbursed to our customers for our products and  in turn  the amount these customers would be willing to pay for our products and services  or could directly reduce the amounts payable to us by such payors 
pricing pressures by third party payors may continue  and these trends may adversely affect our business 
also  continued growth in managed care plans has pressured healthcare providers to find ways of becoming more cost competitive 
managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and in terms of the portion of the healthcare economy they control 
managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of healthcare services and to exert pressure to control healthcare costs 
a rapid concentration of revenue derived from individual managed care payors could harm our business 
if we do not adequately respond to competitive pressures  demand for our products and services could decrease 
the markets we serve are highly competitive and subject to relatively few barriers to entry 
local  regional and national companies are currently competing in many of the healthcare markets we serve and others may do so in the future 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and managerial resources than we have 
consolidation among our competitors  such as pharmacy benefit managers pbms and regional and national infusion pharmacy or specialty pharmacy providers could result in price competition and other competitive factors that could cause a decline in our revenue and profitability 
we expect to continue to encounter competition in the future that could limit our ability to grow revenue and or maintain acceptable pricing levels 
some biotech pharmaceutical suppliers in the specialty pharmacy industry have chosen to limit the number of distributors of their products 
if we are not selected as a preferred distributor of one or more of our core products  our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
we have identified a trend among some of our suppliers toward the retention of a limited number of preferred distributors to market certain of their biopharmaceutical products 
if this trend continues  we cannot be certain that we will be selected and retained as a preferred distributor or can remain a preferred distributor to market these products 
although we believe we can effectively meet our suppliers requirements  there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with other specialty pharmacy companies to retain our position as a distributor of each of our core products 
adverse developments with respect to this trend could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
any termination of  or adverse change in  our relationships with a single source product manufacturer or the loss of supply of a specific  single source specialty drug could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we sell biotech pharmaceuticals that are supplied to us by a variety of manufacturers  many of which are the only source of that specific pharmaceutical 
in order to have access to these pharmaceuticals  and to be able to participate in the launch of new biotech pharmaceuticals  we must maintain good working relations with the manufacturers 
most of the manufacturers of the pharmaceuticals we sell have the right to cancel their supply contracts with us without cause and after giving only minimal notice 
one biotech pharmaceutical  synagis  which is manufactured and distributed by medimmune  inc  represented  and of our revenue  respectively  for the fiscal years ended december   and the loss of our relationship with medimmune  inc or with one or more other biotech pharmaceutical manufacturer would reduce our revenue and profitability 
we have recently experienced  and expect to continue to experience  rapid growth by acquisitions 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business could be disrupted and our operating results could suffer 
our ability to successfully offer our products and services in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process 
in  and  combined  we completed ten separate pharmacy business acquisitions 
our growth through acquisitions  combined with the internal growth of our business based on our business plan  may place a strain on our management systems and resources 
this growth has resulted in  and will continue to result in an increase in responsibilities for management 
to accommodate our growth and compete effectively  we will need to continue to enhance  expand and improve our management and our operational and financial information systems and controls  and to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
our personnel  systems  procedures  or controls may not be adequate to support our operations in the future in light of anticipated growth 
in addition  if we focus our financial resources and management attention on the expansion of our operations rather than on our ongoing operations  our financial results may suffer 
if we are unable to acquire additional local pharmacy facilities on favorable terms  we will be unable to execute our acquisition and development strategy 
our strategy includes increasing our revenue and earnings through strategic acquisitions of infusion therapy pharmacies and related businesses 
our efforts to execute our acquisition strategy may be affected by our ability to identify suitable candidates and negotiate and close acquisitions 
we continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities and expect to complete acquisitions in the future 
the facilities we purchase may require working capital from us during the initial months of operation  depending on whether or not we acquire receivables as part of the acquisition agreement 
we may acquire businesses with significant unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities for failure to comply with health care or reimbursement laws and regulations 
while we generally obtain contractual rights to indemnification from owners of the businesses we acquire  our ability to realize on any indemnification claims will depend on many factors  including  among other things  the availability of assets of the indemnifying parties 
in the future  we may not be successful in acquiring pharmacies or in achieving satisfactory operating results at acquired pharmacies  and we may not be able to acquire infusion therapy facilities that produce returns justifying our related investment 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital resources to fund our acquisitions at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
future acquisitions may also result in the dilution of earnings 
an impairment of goodwill on our financial statements could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
our acquisitions have resulted in the recording of a significant amount of goodwill on our financial statements 
the goodwill was recorded because the fair value of the net assets acquired was less than the purchase price 
we may not realize the full value of this goodwill 
as such  we evaluate on at least an annual basis whether events and circumstances indicate that all or some of the carrying value of goodwill is no longer recoverable  in which case we would write off the unrecoverable goodwill as a charge against our earnings 
since our growth strategy will likely involve the acquisition of other companies  we may record additional goodwill in the future 
the possible write off of this goodwill could negatively impact our future earnings 
we will also be required to allocate a portion of the purchase price of any acquisition to the value of any intangible assets that meet the criteria specified in the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  such as marketing  customer or contract based intangibles 
the amount allocated to these intangible assets could be amortized over a fairly short period  which may negatively affect our earnings or the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had goodwill of million  or of our total assets and approximately of stockholders equity 
changes in state and federal government regulation could restrict our ability to conduct our business 
the marketing  sale and purchase of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and provision of healthcare services generally is extensively regulated by federal and state governments 
other aspects of our business are also subject to government regulation 
we believe we are operating our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the applicable regulatory framework is complex  and the laws are very broad in scope 
many of these laws remain open to interpretation and have not been addressed by substantive court decisions 
accordingly  we cannot provide any assurance that our interpretation would prevail or that one or more government agencies will not interpret them differently 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing law can have a dramatic effect on what we can do  our cost of doing business and the amount of reimbursement we receive from governmental third party payors  such as medicare and medicaid 
also  we could be affected by interpretations of what the appropriate charges are under government programs 
some of the healthcare laws and regulations that apply to our activities include the federal anti kickback statute prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully paying  offering  receiving  or soliciting money or anything else of value in order to induce the referral of patients or to induce a person to purchase  lease  order  arrange for  or recommend services or goods covered in whole or in part by medicare  medicaid  or other government healthcare programs 
although there are safe harbors under the anti kickback statute  some of our business arrangements and the services we provide may not fit within these safe harbors or a safe harbor may not exist that covers the arrangement 
the anti kickback statute is an intent based statute and the failure of a business arrangement to satisfy all elements of a safe harbor will not necessarily render the arrangement illegal  but it may subject that arrangement to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities 
violations of the anti kickback statute can lead to significant penalties  including criminal penalties  civil fines and exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid 
the stark law prohibits physicians from making referrals to entities with which the physicians or their immediate family members have a financial relationship ie  an ownership  investment or compensation relationship for the furnishing of certain designated health services dhs that are reimbursable under medicare 
the stark law exempts certain business relationships which meet its exception requirements 
however  unlike the anti kickback statute under which an activity may fall outside a safe harbor and still be lawful  a referral for dhs that does not fall within an exception is strictly prohibited by the stark law 
a violation of the stark law is punishable by civil sanctions  including significant fines and exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa included administrative simplification provisions that required the department of health and human services hhs to adopt national standards governing electronic health care transactions 
at the same time  it was recognized that advances in electronic technology could erode the privacy of health information 
consequently  congress incorporated provisions into hipaa that mandated the adoption of federal privacy protections for individually identifiable health information 
hhs published a final regulation in the form of the privacy rule in december  which became effective april  the privacy rule was subsequently modified  and the final version was adopted in august the privacy rule set national standards for the protection of health information for providers and others who transmit health information electronically 
by the compliance date of april   covered entities were required to implement standards to protect and guard against misuse of individually identifiable health information 
we have implemented the standards set forth in the privacy rule and these standards were in place on april  we believe that we are in compliance with the privacy rule or any more stringent federal or state laws relating to privacy 
penalties for non compliance with the privacy rule and other hipaa administrative simplification provisions range from civil fines to criminal penalties 
in addition to regulating privacy of individual health information  hipaa includes several anti fraud and abuse laws  extends criminal penalties to private health care benefit programs and  in addition to medicare and medicaid  to other federal health care programs  and expands the office of inspector general s oig s authority to exclude persons and entities from participating in the medicare and medicaid programs 
pharmacies and pharmacists must obtain state licenses to operate and dispense pharmaceuticals 
if we are unable to maintain our licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on non resident pharmacies  this could limit or affect our ability to operate in some states which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
we may become subject to federal and state investigations 
both federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies  as well as their executives and managers 
these investigations relate to a wide variety of topics  including referral and billing practices 
further  amendments to the federal false claims act have made it easier for private parties to bring whistleblower lawsuits against companies 
some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions 
the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services and the department of justice have  from time to time  established national enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse 
some of our activities could become the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries 
for example  we have significant medicare and medicaid billings 
in addition  our executives  some of whom have worked at other healthcare companies that are or may become the subject of federal and state investigations and private litigation  could be included in governmental investigations or named as defendants in private litigation  resulting in adverse publicity against us 
we are not aware of any governmental investigations involving any of our company owned facilities or our executives 
a future investigation of us could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us  as well as adverse publicity  and could seriously undermine our ability to compete for business  negotiate acquisitions  hire new personnel and otherwise conduct our business 
we may be subject to liability for the services we offer and the products we sell 
we and other participants in the health care market are  have been and are likely to continue to be subject to lawsuits based upon alleged malpractice  product liability  negligence or similar legal theories  many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs 
a successful claim not covered by our professional liability insurance or substantially in excess of our insurance coverage could cause us to pay out a substantial award 
in addition  we retain liability on claims up to the amount of our deductibles  which generally are  per occurrence 
further  our insurance policy is subject to annual renewal and it may not be possible to obtain liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms  with adequate coverage against potential liabilities  or at all 
also  claims against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could be a serious distraction to management and could harm our reputation 
our image and reputation may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees that are outside of our control 
the majority of our local pharmacy locations are operated by franchisees 
franchisees are independent business owners and are not our subsidiaries or employees 
consequently  the quality of a franchised operation is dependent upon its owner s and manager s 
franchisees may not successfully operate facilities or they may fail to comply with federal and state health care statutes and regulations 
if they do not operate their franchises effectively or do not comply with applicable industry regulations  our image and reputation may suffer which could negatively impact our results of operations 
our gross profit margins may decline if our franchise royalties are reduced 
we rely on royalty payments from our franchisees 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  we derived  and  respectively  of our revenue from franchise royalties and related fees 
our franchisees pay royalties on their gross receipts 
because there is no cost of goods sold associated with this revenue  franchise royalties and other fees represent a significant portion of our gross profit 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  royalties and other franchise fees represented  and  respectively  of our gross profit 
if our franchisees encounter business or operational difficulties  our revenue from royalties may be adversely affected 
such difficulties may also negatively impact our ability to sell new franchises 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully attract new franchisees or if our existing franchise owners do not enter into new franchise agreements with us when their current agreements expire  our franchise revenue  gross profit and overall profitability will decline 
the loss of one or more of our key employees could harm our operations 
our success depends upon the availability and performance of our key executives  including our chief executive officer  rajat rai  and our president and chief operating officer  richard m 
smith 
we do not have key person insurance for any of our key executives 
the loss of the services of mr 
rai  mr 
smith or any of our other key executives could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 
the current or future shortage in licensed pharmacists  nurses and other clinicians could adversely affect our business 
the healthcare industry is currently experiencing a shortage of licensed pharmacists  nurses and other healthcare professionals 
consequently  hiring and retaining qualified personnel will be difficult due to intense competition for their services and employment 
any failure to hire or retain pharmacists  nurses or other healthcare professionals could impair our ability to expand or maintain our operations 
increases in the per share market price of our common stock in future periods could result in dilution of our earnings per share 
increases in the market price of our common stock may result in dilution of our earnings per share related to the conversion feature of our senior convertible notes 
in accordance with eitf  our diluted shares must include the dilutive effect or our convertible notes for periods during which the average market price of our common stock exceeds its conversion price per the terms of the notes during a given period 
the initial conversion price was set at per share subject to future adjustment  as needed 
if the average market price of our common stock should exceed the conversion price per share in a given period  our diluted shares would increase which could reduce our net income per diluted share for such period 
we may not have the ability to raise the funds to purchase our outstanding convertible senior notes on the purchase dates or upon a fundamental change or to pay the cash payment due upon conversion 
on each of november   november  and november   holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to purchase  for cash  all or a portion of their senior convertible notes at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  that date 
if a fundamental change occurs  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase  for cash  all or a portion of their notes 
in addition  upon conversion of the notes  we will be required to pay the principal return  or  in certain circumstances  other amounts  in cash 
we may not have sufficient funds for any required repurchase of the notes

we contract with managed care organizations and other third party payors who reimburse us for the services we provide to their subscribers 
our services are provided by our two central  high volume distribution facilities  company owned locations and franchised locations 
the year was marked by continued growth in revenue and net income  as well as strategic initiatives designed to pave the way for continued growth in the year and beyond 
revenue grew by in to million from million in this growth was primarily due to indigenous growth in our company owned offices and increased sales volume for xolair 
continuing sales efforts produced a same store growth rate of for infusion and related healthcare services  with the largest increase being from anti infective therapies 
specialty pharmacy services revenue increased on a same store basis primarily due to increased sales of xolair  human growth hormone and other specialty drugs distributed by our two central  high volume distribution facilities and company owned locations 
this revenue growth  combined with ongoing cost containment efforts and our improved management of accounts receivable  resulted in net income of million for the year  an increase of over the prior year 
in november  we completed an million offering of convertible senior notes due in order to provide us with the resources to fund future growth objectives 
we intend to use the proceeds from the offering for business acquisitions  stock repurchases  working capital and other corporate needs 
concurrent with the completion of this offering  we terminated our credit and security agreement with jp morgan business credit corp 
we continue to actively seek strategic and accretive acquisition opportunities  particularly in the area of home infusion 
the majority of our revenue is generated from managed care contracts and other agreements with commercial third party payors 
we have one managed care contract  with blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc bc bs of florida  that represents a significant portion of our revenue 
in the years  and  respectively   and of our revenue was related to this contract 
as of december  and  and of option care s accounts receivable was due from bc bs of florida 
our contract with bc bs of florida is terminable by either party on days notice and  unless terminated  renews each september for an additional one year term 
this contract renewed in september with no material changes 
no other managed care contract represents more than of our revenue 
we also generate revenue from governmental healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
for the years  and  respectively   and of our revenue came from these governmental healthcare programs 
as of december  and  respectively  and of total accounts receivable were due from these programs 
many of the pharmaceuticals we provide are reimbursed at some percentage of the average wholesale price awp of the pharmaceuticals 
awp for most pharmaceuticals is compiled and published by private companies  including first databank  inc however  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of changed the way in which covered outpatient drugs are reimbursed by the medicare program 
starting in january  payment for most drugs covered by medicare decreased to of the average wholesale price awp determined as of april  beginning in  reimbursement for non self administered drugs furnished to patients in conjunction with other medicare covered services has been set at either of the average sales price asp or through a competitive acquisition program to be phased in beginning in the eventual replacement of awp by asp as the standard measure for determining reimbursement by the medicare program could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition  potentially reducing our revenue and narrowing our gross profit margins 
while our medicare exposure is relatively small  the adoption of asp by state medicaid programs or by managed care organizations and other private payors could have a more material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions have been and will continue to be an integral part of our overall growth strategy 
in february  we acquired of the outstanding stock of our franchise in st 
cloud  minnesota 
during  we used million in cash to complete five small acquisitions in markets that we currently serve 
while none of these acquisitions was material to our overall results of operations  they will help solidify our position and ongoing profitability in these markets 
during  we invested million in cash for acquisitions in texas and minnesota 
on february   our board of directors authorized a for stock split effective march  for shareholders of record as of march  the purpose of this split is to increase the liquidity of our common stock and make us an attractive investment option for a wider range of investors

infusion and related healthcare services revenue increased by million  or  over as a result of continuing sales and marketing efforts  with the largest gains relating to anti infective therapies 
specialty pharmacy services revenue increased by million  or over the prior year 
this increase was primarily related to higher sales of xolair  human growth hormone  synagis  and a variety of other specialty drugs through our two central  high volume distribution facilities and company owned pharmacy locations 
for  option care s revenue was million  an increase of million  or  from the million in of this increase  million was related to increased same store sales of specialty pharmaceuticals 
business acquisitions  net of disposals  accounted for another million of the increase 
the remaining increase was primarily due to a million same store sales increase in infusion therapy services  partially offset by declines in other healthcare services such as durable medical equipment sales 
overall  comparing to  our same store sales growth rate was for our core services of specialty pharmacy and infusion therapy 
specialty pharmacy revenue specialty pharmacy revenue consists of the distribution of specialty pharmaceutical products to patient s home or other non hospital settings such as physician s offices on behalf of manufacturers  managed care companies or  to a lesser extent  government healthcare programs 
our specialty pharmacy revenue is derived only from sales by our company owned pharmacies 
specialty pharmacy revenue also includes fees received from biotech drug manufacturers for providing clinical compliance and patient outcomes data for specific products 
in  our specialty pharmacy revenue was million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
a significant percentage of this increase was attributable to sales of xolair  a new specialty drug released in for the treatment of moderate to severe allergic asthma 
we partnered with genentech and novartis pharmaceuticals corporation to participate in the launch of this product in and have seen a steady increase in our xolair revenue throughout in addition to the increased sales of xolair  we generated double digit increases in sales of human growth hormone and a variety of other specialty drugs throughout our network of company owned pharmacies 
during  we also produced a increase in revenue from our central  high volume distribution pharmacy in florida and generated an increase in sales of synagis  a seasonal drug for the prevention of respiratory synctial virus rsv in premature infants 
our synagis revenue reached million in these increases were due to our ongoing sales and marketing efforts and continuing increases in the overall specialty pharmacy market 
in  our overall specialty pharmacy revenue increased by million  or  to million compared to million in the prior year 
of this million increase  million was related to acquisitions completed in several factors contributed to the remaining million increase 
synagis revenue grew to million in  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
the synagis season runs from approximately october through april of each year 
option care continues to be a preferred provider of this product on behalf of its manufacturer  medimmune  inc also  during the third and fourth quarters of  we began to generate revenue from xolair 
in addition to increased sales of synagis and xolair  we saw increases in sales of a variety of specialty drugs throughout our network of company owned pharmacies 
this was due to increased cross selling of our infusion and specialty pharmacy services and from expanded utilization under some of our specialty drug only contracts with managed care payors 
revenue from our principal managed care contract  with blue cross blue shield of florida  remained consistent with the prior year 
infusion and related healthcare services revenue the following table sets forth our infusion and related healthcare services revenue by service type amounts in thousands years ended december  amounts of total revenue amounts of total revenue amounts of total revenue infusion and related healthcare services infusion therapy other related healthcare services total infusion and related healthcare services infusion and related healthcare services includes the provision of home infusion therapies  respiratory therapy and durable medical equipment sales and rentals rt dme and home healthcare services provided by our company owned pharmacies 
in  infusion and related healthcare services revenue was million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
infusion therapy increased by million  or  while other related healthcare services increased by million  or 
we focused in on expanding our provision of infusion therapy through focused sales efforts and continued quality of service 
as a result of these efforts  we generated higher revenue from most of our company owned pharmacies 
our growth was across multiple therapies  including anti infective  nutritional and chemotherapy 
on a same store basis  our infusion therapy revenue grew by in over the prior year 
acquisitions and start ups  less disposals  accounted for a increase in infusion therapy revenue 
our overall same store growth rate for the infusion and related services line was 
in  revenue from infusion and related healthcare services increased by million  or  to million compared to million in our core home infusion therapy revenue increased by approximately million  while other related healthcare services revenue declined by million as we scaled back our provision of rt dme and home healthcare services in certain markets 
of the million increase in infusion therapy revenue  approximately million was related to same store sales growth  while the remaining million was related to business acquisitions and disposals 
our same store sales growth rate for infusion therapy revenue was in other revenue other revenue consists of franchise related revenue and software revenue 
franchise related revenue consists of royalties and other fees generated from our franchise network  as well as vendor rebates earned from our franchises purchases under option care s contracts with manufacturers and vendors 
software revenue consists of software license fees  support and training fees generated by our subsidiary  mbi 
for  we recorded other revenue of million representing an increase of  or  over the prior year 
of the revenue  million consisted of franchise royalties and related fees  of which million was royalties and million was franchise termination fees 
in the prior year  royalty revenue was million 
the  decline in the current year was attributable to franchise terminations in and software related revenue increased by  in due to increased sales of the iemphsys pharmacy management software 
in  other revenue was million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to  in franchise termination fees and  in non compete fees recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the mutually agreed termination and sale of one of our franchises 
our franchise royalty revenue was million in compared to million in this increase was due to higher cash collections within our existing franchise network  as well as from the franchising of our grand junction  colorado and bullhead city  arizona pharmacies during the first half of mbi software related revenue declined from million in to million in cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists of the cost of goods sold and services provided to our patients 
cost of goods primarily consists of the cost of pharmaceutical products  durable medical equipment and ancillary medical supplies provided to our patients 
cost of service includes the salaries  wages and other costs related to our provision of nursing and pharmacy services  as well as our cost to deliver pharmaceutical products and durable medical equipment to our patients 
while we are able to separately identify our costs between goods and services  we cannot separate our revenue accordingly 
for our typical patient  we provide both pharmaceutical products and nursing and other services 
often  a portion of our revenue consists of a per diem payment that represents a combined reimbursement for certain goods and services 
therefore  we do not separately report revenue between products and services 
cost of goods for  our cost of goods was million  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year s million cost of goods 
this increase was related to our million increase in revenue over this period 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods increased from for to for this increase was primarily due to shifts in product mix 
during  we generated a higher growth rate for our specialty pharmacy services  which have a higher cost of goods component than our infusion and related healthcare services 
specifically  our growth in xolair revenue in was a major factor in our overall increase in cost of goods as a percentage of revenue 
specialty pharmaceuticals are higher in cost and generate a lower margin than infusion drugs 
if our sales of specialty pharmaceuticals continue to increase at a faster pace than sales of infusion products  our cost of goods is expected to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue 
for  cost of goods was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue in the dollar increase was due to our growth in revenue during  particularly from the sale of specialty pharmaceuticals  and from the effect of acquisitions completed during the basis point increase in cost of goods as a percentage of revenue was due to the proportionately greater increase in specialty pharmacy revenue versus infusion therapy revenue 
we receive rebates from various drug and medical supply manufacturers based on the volume of purchases by our company owned pharmacies and our franchised pharmacies 
those rebates earned from purchases by our company owned pharmacies are recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 
vendor rebates reduced our cost of goods by million in compared to million in the increase in vendor rebates was due to our increase in overall purchase volume  changes to our vendor and manufacturer agreements and guaranteed cost reductions realized under our contractual agreement with a group purchasing organization 
in addition to rebates  we also receive prompt payment discounts from a number of our drug and medical supply vendors 
in  we recorded approximately million in prompt payment discounts compared to  in the prior year 
this increase in prompt payment discounts was related to higher purchase volume in the current year and changes within our agreements with manufacturers and vendors 
cost of service our cost of service for was million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of service declined from in to in this decline was due to our current year increase in specialty pharmacy services  which have a smaller service component than infusion and related healthcare services  and due to our overall increase in revenue which produced certain efficiencies of scale 
our cost of service for the year was million compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  cost of service was equal to in each period 
slight increases in salaries and wages and related costs during the current year caused the overall cost of service percentage to remain steady in spite of the faster growth rate in specialty pharmacy services  which have a smaller cost of service component 
gross profit the following table sets forth the gross profit margin for each of our service lines for the periods indicated years ended december  gross profit margin specialty pharmacy infusion and related healthcare services other overall gross profit margin in  our gross profit was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in the prior year 
the overall decline in our gross profit margin was related to a shift in business mix  as our growth in specialty pharmacy revenue outpaced our growth in infusion and related healthcare services 
the decline in specialty pharmacy gross profit margin from in to in was due to our growth in revenue from higher cost drugs  such as xolair and human growth hormone 
our infusion and related healthcare services gross profit margin was fairly consistent  increasing slightly from in to in continuing cost containment efforts for our infusion drugs were a contributing factor to this increase 
in  our gross profit was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or or revenue  in the growth in our gross profit and the small decline in gross profit margin are both due to our growth in specialty pharmacy revenue  which outpaced our growth in infusion and related healthcare services revenue in the gross profit margins of each of our service lines remained fairly stable 
within both specialty pharmacy and infusion and related healthcare services  the gross profit margin changes were primarily related to our mix of drugs and therapies 
selling  general and administrative expenses for  our selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
of this million increase  million was in wages and related expenses  which increased by approximately over the prior year 
wages increased due to new hires and salary cost of living adjustments  though this increase was partially offset by a decrease in employee benefits costs due to redesign of our employee health insurance plans and lower claims experience in the current year 
building rent and related costs increased by  over the prior year  as we increased the total square of our office space by to accommodate business growth 
our marketing and promotional expenses increased by  in compared to as a result of our increased focus on sales and marketing efforts in in  selling  general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of million  or  over the largest component in the increase was wages and related expenses  which increased by approximately million 
of this million increase in wages and related expenses  approximately million is attributable to acquisitions completed during within our ongoing operations  we expanded staffing to meet operating needs in certain areas such as billing and reimbursement and internal audit  and also experienced increases in employee health insurance costs 
we also incurred additional selling  general and administrative expenses related to our roll out of mbi s new software  iemphsys 
in addition  the operational restructuring undertaken in the second half of resulted in approximately million in severance and related expenses  and another  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
other selling  general and administrative expenses that increased in included business insurance costs due to an overall hardening of the insurance market  and depreciation and amortization expense due to a  write down of an internally developed software product that was being re engineered 
in  acquisitions accounted for approximately  of the total million increase in non wage related selling  general and administrative costs 
provision for doubtful accounts in  our provision for doubtful accounts was million  or of revenue 
this represents a significant decline from the million provision for doubtful account in  which included a special provision of million related to write offs in our texas offices 
in  we recorded a provision for revenue generated by our specialty drug distribution offices and a provision  on average  for revenue generated at our company owned infusion pharmacies 
these percentages reflect the difference in collection risk involved in these services 
for our texas offices  actual cash collections approximated the amounts we estimated in when we recorded a special provision of million for their accounts receivable 
accordingly  no material provision adjustments were recorded in for these offices 
in  our provision for doubtful accounts increased significantly over as a result of a bad debt charge of million taken in the quarter ended september  overall  our provision for doubtful accounts was million in  an increase of million  or  over the prior year provision of million 
as a percentage of revenue  our provision for doubtful accounts equaled of revenue in compared to in the bad debt charge of million we recorded in was related to the accounts receivable of our texas offices 
we completed multiple acquisitions in the dallas and houston markets during causing us to have multiple pharmacy locations in the same markets 
during  we began the process of consolidating our operations into one office in each market 
in the dallas area  in we consolidated the operations of four offices into one 
a variety of operational problems related to the consolidation of these offices created the need for additional bad debt reserves 
many of these problems affected the billing and reimbursement function 
the four predecessor offices were not all utilizing the same billing system 
as part of the consolidation process  we transferred all data from these four offices onto one data system 
during the data conversion  some of the accounts receivable data was lost and could not be recaptured  reducing our ability to collect the accounts and increasing the likelihood of bad debt write offs 
in addition  in the process of consolidating the billing and reimbursement function  staff reductions and employee turnover decreased the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
often those employees responsible for collecting our accounts receivable were unfamiliar with the accounts  having not billed them 
we also experienced difficulty in integrating staff from the four predecessor offices into one cohesive unit  evidenced by an increase in process errors  such as failure to obtain proper authorization before billing claims and loading incorrect contract fee schedules into our billing software 
while the long term effect of our consolidation efforts in texas was to improve efficiency  the operational challenges caused by the consolidation weakened the effectiveness of our billing and collection process and led to an increase in bad debt write offs and reserve requirements during after a detailed analysis of the collectability of the outstanding accounts  we determined in the third quarter of that a million additional provision for doubtful accounts was necessary to adequately reserve for potential write offs 
we have since made several personnel changes and implemented operational enhancements in these offices  designed to help us more closely monitor billing and collections performance to improve the collectability of current and future revenue 
goodwill amortization we recorded no goodwill amortization expense in either or in keeping with the provision of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill but instead test our goodwill annually for impairment 
we completed our annual tests for goodwill impairment on october  and and identified no impairment of our goodwill as of those dates  or in subsequent periods 
interest income expense  net in  we recorded approximately  in net interest income compared to net interest expense of  in the prior year 
positive operating cash flow and minimal debt throughout most of the year allowed us to generate more interest income than interest expense in in november  we completed an million offering of convertible senior notes  due we recorded  in interest expense on the notes during november and december however  the cash generated from the convertible notes offering earned interest that essentially offset this expense 
interest expense in was  representing an increase of  over the prior year 
the interest was primarily from borrowings against our revolving credit facility with jp morgan business credit corporation 
we entered with approximately million outstanding under this facility  but ended the year with a zero balance as a result of strong operational cash flow of million during income tax provision for the year  our provision for income taxes was million on pre tax income of million  compared to provision for income taxes of million on million of pre tax income in this equates to a provision rate in compared to for the prior year 
while our effective federal income tax rate increased slightly in due to our increase in pre tax income  this increase was more than offset by a decline in our effective state income tax rate 
this decline was primarily due to changes in the profitability of our operations in various states compared to the prior year 
we anticipate that our effective income tax rate for will approximate our rate in in  our provision for income taxes was million on pre tax income of million  compared to a provision of million on million of pre tax income in as a percentage of pre tax income  our income tax provision rate was nearly unchanged  at in compared to in in  our overall federal income tax rate was slightly lower due to our lower pretax income in that year 
however  we had increased business in states with higher state income tax rates and an increase in various non deductible expenses in  more than offsetting the decline in our federal income tax rate 
net income and earnings per share our net income for the year was million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase was due to our continued revenue growth during the year  resulting from our refocused sales and marketing efforts  along with cost containment efforts and operational improvements related to collection of accounts receivable 
as a result of our focused sales efforts  our revenue grew by and our gross profit increased by over the prior year 
we resolved the operational issues that led to our prior year bad debt and restructuring charges totaling million 
our diluted earnings per share was in compared to in  an increase of 
total diluted shares increased slightly from million in to million in primarily due to new shares issued under our stock incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan as well as an increased dilutive effect of options outstanding  partially offset by our purchases of treasury stock 
if the market price of our common stock should increase in to above the conversion price for our convertible senior notes  which is currently per share  our diluted shares outstanding would increase due to diluted shares issuable upon conversion of the notes and a continued increase in the dilutive effect of outstanding  unexercised stock options 
such increase in diluted shares would lower our future net income per diluted share 
our net income for the year was million compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  our net income was equal to of revenue in compared to of revenue in this decline in net income was primarily due to the bad debt and restructuring charges totaling million pretax  taken in the quarter ended september  increases in various operational costs such as business insurance and administrative salaries and related costs also played a part in the net income decline 
our diluted earnings per share was in compared to in diluted shares increased from approximately million in to million in  primarily due to new shares issued to employees who participated in our employee stock purchase plan and shares issued as a result of stock option exercises 
cash flows our cash balance grew from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to positive operating cash flow and the additional liquidity provided by our million offering of convertible senior notes in november operating cash flows remained steady at a positive million for the year 
we used million in investing activities in  of which million was spent to purchase short term investments  such as commercial paper  and the remainder was used for business acquisitions and equipment purchases 
our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend policy  leading to our payment of million in dividends in  and we used million to repurchase shares of our stock at various times during the year 
cash provided by operations for  we generated million in positive cash flow from operations 
the primary cause of our positive operating cash flow in was our net income of million 
through effective billing and collections efforts and a continued shift in mix toward specialty pharmacy services  we were able to reduce our days sales outstanding from days as of december  to days as of december   helping us maintain strong operating cash flow in a year in which our revenue grew by 
our operating cash flow in also benefited from a net increase in deferred income tax liabilities and our utilization of a large income tax overpayment from the prior year 
net cash flow provided by operations in was million 
our net income in the year and improved cash collection performance  which led to a reduction in our days sales outstanding  were the main reasons for the improvement 
overall collections of accounts receivable throughout the company were strong  despite difficulties in some of our texas locations 
we re focused on billing and collections in  reducing our gross accounts receivable from million as of december  to million at december  in addition to improvements in our overall billing and collection performance  the decline in accounts receivable and increase in operational cash flow was also due to the increase in specialty pharmacy services revenue as compared to infusion and related healthcare services revenue 
specialty pharmacy revenue tends to have a shorter collection cycle than infusion and related healthcare services revenue 
net cash flow provided by operations in was million 
the positive cash flow from operations was primarily due to our net income of million during that year 
our cash flow from operations was less than our net income due to an increase in accounts receivable during this increase was primarily due to the effect of acquisitions completed during and late in acquisitions used million of cash flow from operations  while existing operations provided million of cash flow from operations 
for acquisitions  growth in accounts receivable balances due to integration and consolidation issues  particularly in our texas offices  was the main cause of their negative operating cash flow 
for our existing business  the million cash flow from operations was due to our increased net income  combined with a reduction in our days sales outstanding as of december  compared to december  this reduction was partially due to the increase in specialty pharmacy revenue  which tends to have a shorter collection cycle than home infusion and other related services 
cash used in investing activities in  we used million in cash in investing activities 
we used million of the net proceeds generated from our million offering of convertible senior notes to purchase short term investments  primarily consisting of commercial paper and other similar instruments having maturities of three months or more at time of purchase 
most of our short term investments have periodic interest rate adjustments  generally every or days  based on changing market conditions 
in  we used million for the purchase of equipment and other fixed assets  million for acquisitions and  to acquire other long term assets 
of the million expenditure for equipment and other fixed assets during  million was for revenue producing medical equipment such as infusion pumps  million was for infrastructure improvements such as office furniture and equipment  million was for computer hardware and software and  was for internally developed software 
we completed five small acquisitions during  all of which helped us consolidate our market position in existing markets that we serve 
we used million in cash to complete these acquisitions  and may owe up to million in additional cash consideration in  subject to certain contingencies 
we used million in cash in investing activities in the primary use of cash was for acquisition payments 
we used million in cash during the year  of which million was related to additional consideration for prior year acquisitions and  was for a small acquisition completed in march the largest cash outflow was million paid to acquire the remaining minority interest in infusion specialties  inc  a specialty pharmacy business that we acquired a majority interest in during in addition  we made scheduled payments totaling million to complete our purchase of a large home infusion business in the minneapolis st

we used million in to fund five new acquisitions and the additional consideration due on prior years acquisitions 
we also used million in cash during to acquire equipment and other fixed assets  including million for infusion pumps and other revenue producing medical equipment 
in  we purchased a large number of infusion pumps to replace rented pumps in order to save on overall cost 
of the equipment purchases  we also spent million on the development of software  primarily mbi s new iemphsys pharmacy management software system 
another million was spent on leasehold improvements related to the build out of our new corporate headquarters and on the relocation of several of our company owned pharmacies 
the remaining million was used to upgrade computer systems and for various other office furniture and equipment 
cash used in financing activities in  we generated million from financing activities 
in november  we completed an million offering of convertible senior notes  due the purpose of the offering was to finance future growth opportunities  specifically acquisitions  stock repurchases  and working capital and other general corporate needs 
we paid million in underwriting  legal and other fees related to this offering 
these fees will be amortized over a five year period 
during  we generated million from the issuance of stock related to our employee stock plans 
this was offset by our use of million in cash to acquire treasury stock and million to pay dividends to our common stockholders 
we also used  for scheduled installments on capital leases and other debt 
in  we used million cash in financing activities 
the primary use of cash in was to pay off the outstanding balance on our credit facility with jp morgan business credit corporation  which was million as of december  we were able to pay off this balance due to our positive operating cash flow of million in in  in addition to the use of cash to pay down our credit facility balance  we also used approximately  at the end of the year to repurchase shares of our common stock 
offsetting these uses of cash  we generated million in cash in from the issuance of common stock to participants in our employee stock purchase plan and from our employees stock option exercises throughout the year 
in  financing activities provided million in cash 
we borrowed a net million under our credit and security agreement with jp morgan business credit corporation to fund acquisition activities during the year  primarily our july purchase of a large home infusion business in the minneapolis st 
paul area 
the credit and security agreement with jp morgan became effective on march   and we used  in cash to pay loan origination costs and related fees 
we also used  to pay scheduled installments on capital leases and notes and loans payable 
during  we generated million from issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and from employee stock option exercises 
accounts receivable the following table sets forth our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding as of december for each year presented dollar amounts in thousands trade accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts  as percentage of trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding days sales outstanding dso is based on trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  and is calculated using the exhaustion method  whereby the net accounts receivable balance is exhausted against each preceding month s or partial month s net revenue 
the dso calculation excludes revenue not related to patient care  such as franchise royalties and other fees and software license and support revenue 
the following tables set forth the percentage breakdown of our trade accounts receivable by aging category and by major payor type as of december for each year presented accounts receivable by aging category aged days aged days aged days aged over days total accounts receivable by major payor type managed care and other payors medicare and medicaid total as of december   our trade accounts receivable  net of bad debt reserves  was million compared to million as of december  this increase in accounts receivable was related to our revenue growth during our revenue for the quarter ended december  was million  which was higher than our revenue of million recorded in the corresponding prior year quarter 
during  we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts totaling million and wrote off accounts totaling million 
the current year bad debt write offs include various accounts we reserved in when we recorded a bad debt charge of million in response to operational problems in our texas locations 
we have improved operations in these offices and as a result were able to record a much lower provision for doubtful accounts in actual collections in for our texas offices approximated the estimates we made in when we recorded the million special provision for doubtful accounts 
as of december   our trade accounts receivable  net of bad debt reserves  was million compared to million as of december  the decline in trade accounts receivable in was primarily due to a combination of improved cash collection performance in most of our pharmacies and the million bad debt charge taken in the quarter ended september  related to our texas accounts receivable 
we wrote off million of these accounts during the quarter ended december  for the year  our company wide bad debt write offs approximately doubled  increasing from million in to million in one of our primary objectives in was to reverse this trend 
operational changes in our texas offices allowed us to more closely monitor the performance of these offices in terms of overall billing and collections practices  helping us to avoid a repeat of these problems in our days sales outstanding dso is calculated using the exhaustion method for our accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
our dso declined from days as of december  to days as of december  this was due in part to the continuing increase in our provision of specialty pharmacy services  which have a faster collection cycle than infusion and related healthcare services  as well as our billing and collections performance during the year 
the dso improvement also reflects improvements in collection processes  including the increased use of electronic claims submission 
our dso declined from as of december  to days as of december  since we calculate dso net of allowance for doubtful accounts  both cash collections performance and changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts affect the number 
improved cash collections performance by most of our pharmacies was part of the reason for our decline in dso in  combined with an increase in specialty pharmacy services  which has a faster collection cycle than infusion and related healthcare services 
the other major factor causing the decline in dso was the bad debt charge of million taken in the quarter ended september   which reduced our net accounts receivable 
the aging composition of our accounts receivable at december  was similar to the composition a year earlier 
as of both december  and  of our accounts receivable was aged days or less 
as of december   of our accounts receivable was aged days or less 
this number as of december  reflected the collection problems we had in and early in in our texas offices 
write offs taken in and improved billing and collections performance in allowed us to increase this percentage of our accounts receivable aged days or less to its current level 
as of december  and  respectively  and of our accounts receivable was related to government healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
virtually all of the remaining and of our accounts receivable as of december  and  respectively  was due from managed care organizations and other third party payors 
our most significant managed care contract  with blue cross and blue shield of florida  accounted for approximately and of our accounts receivable as of december  and  respectively 
this contract produced and of our revenue for the years and  respectively 
our accounts receivable under this contract are proportionately low relative to revenue due to quick payment terms in the contract and the fact that a high percentage of our revenue under this contract is for specialty pharmacy services 
a very small percentage of our accounts are due from individual patients 
co payments tend to be insignificant in our business  and we typically collect any co payments before or upon delivery of products and services to the patient in order to minimize collection risk 
contractual obligations and other commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more detail 
in thousands payments by period total convertible senior notes  due interest on convertible senior notes  due operating lease obligations pharmaceutical purchase obligations business acquisitions obligations capital leases and other long term debt total contractual cash obligations these notes may be redeemed by us  in whole or in part  at any time on or after november   and the holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on november   and or subject to certain conditions  the notes may become convertible into cash and shares of stock in any quarter after december  the repayment schedule shown above assumes no early redemption or conversion of the notes before their due date  november  liquidity and capital resources at various times  we have financed our operations and acquisitions from operating cash flows  common stock and debt offerings and credit facility borrowings 
in november  we completed an million offering of convertible senior notes  due the purpose of the offering was to finance our future growth initiatives 
the funds may be used for acquisitions  stock repurchases  operating cash needs and other general corporate purposes 
the initial offering was completed on november  for million  with an option for an additional million  which was exercised in full on november  we will pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning on may  the notes are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock based on our stock s market price and other conditions 
the notes cannot be redeemed by us before november  on each of november   november  and november   the holders can require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes for their principal amount plus accrued interest 
at any time on or after november   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes we redeem  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
we incurred deferred financing costs of million related to this offering  consisting of underwriting  legal and other related costs 
these costs will be amortized over a five year period 
our total working capital increased by million during  from million at december  to million at december  the primary cause of this increase was the million in cash generated from our convertible senior notes offering  net of financing costs 
we also generated positive operating cash flow during that increased our cash reserves before consideration of the debt offering  accounting for approximately million of our increase in working capital 
in addition  our revenue growth during produced a million increase in accounts receivable at december  compared to december   further contributing to the increase in working capital 
since march   we had been party to a revolving credit and security agreement with jp morgan business credit corporation  jp morgan chase bank and lasalle bank  na the total facility was originally million and was reduced to million in june in connection with the completion of our convertible senior notes offering  we notified the lenders of our desire to terminate the agreement 
the credit and security agreement was terminated effective october  the agreement provided for a commitment fee  calculated and paid quarterly based on the average daily unused portion of the facility 
the credit facility was secured by substantially all of our assets 
we have one outstanding letter of credit at december  in the amount of million drawn in favor of arch specialty insurance company  our provider of general and professional liability insurance coverage during the twelve month period ended june  we maintain a compensating cash balance in the amount of million to cover this letter of credit 
as of december   we had cash and short term investments totaling million 
we have been cash flow positive from operations for each of the last three years and anticipate remaining cash flow positive from continuing operations in our only material debt as of december  was our million of convertible senior notes 
we intend to fund our future capital needs through operating cash flows and proceeds generated from our notes offering 
in the event that additional capital is required beyond our operating cash flow and the proceeds of the notes  we may not be able to obtain such capital from other sources on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our business strategy includes the selective acquisition of additional infusion pharmacies and other related healthcare businesses 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities  and view acquisitions as a key part of our growth strategy 
in the past  we have typically paid cash for our acquisitions  with the majority of the purchase price paid at closing 
for future acquisitions  we may utilize cash  common stock  or a combination of the two to pay the purchase price 
historically  we have used operating cash flows and  when necessary  borrowings on our credit facility to finance our past acquisitions 
we may require additional capital in excess of our current availability in order to complete future acquisitions 
it is impossible to predict the amount of capital that may be required for acquisitions  and there is no assurance that sufficient financing for these activities will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  which may limit our ability to complete desired acquisitions 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised share based payment on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principals board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
sfas no 
r must be adopted in the first interim or annual period beginning after june   which in our case would be the quarterly period beginning july  and ending september  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  using the modified retrospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and on required changes in the method of computation of fair value 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in our disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note j to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million   and million in  and  respectively 
emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eift addresses the accounting for a preexisting relationship in a business combination  specifically 
the task force reached a consensus that a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a preexisting relationship exists 
such a business combination should be considered a multiple element transaction with one element being the business combination and the other element being the settlement of the preexisting relationship 
settlement of the preexisting relationship should be treated independent of the business combination  and the gain or loss recorded from such settlement should be the same as it would be absent the business combination 
the task force further determined that the acquisition of a right that the acquirer had previously granted to the acquired entity to use the acquirer s recognized or unrecognized intangible assets for example  rights to the acquirer s trade name under a franchise agreement or rights to the acquirer s technology under a technology licensing agreement should be included as part of the business combination  and should be valued as a separately identifiable intangible asset in the allocation of purchase price 
the task force also reached consensus that a settlement loss or gain should be recognized in conjunction with the effective settlement of a lawsuit or executory contract in a business combination  unless otherwise specified in existing authoritative literature 
the following disclosures should be made for business combinations between parties with a preexisting relationship a 
the nature of the preexisting relationship  b 
the measurement of the settlement amount of the preexisting relationship  if any  and the valuation method used to determine the settlement amount  and c 
the amount of any settlement gain or loss recognized and its classification in the statement of operations 
we anticipate that eitf may apply to us in our future business combinations 
we have purchased several of our franchises in recent years and plan to acquire additional franchises in the future 
we will apply the guidance contained in eitf when accounting for such business combinations 
emerging issues task force eitf issue the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share eitf addresses when contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share 
contingently convertible instruments are instruments that have embedded conversion features that are contingently convertible or exercisable based on a a market price trigger or b multiple contingencies if one of the contingencies is a market price trigger and the instrument can be converted or share settled based on meeting the specified market condition 
a market price trigger is a market condition that is based at least in part on the issuer s own share price 
the task force reached a consensus that contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share if dilutive regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
the task force observed that there is no substantive economic difference between contingently convertible instruments and conventional convertible instruments with a market price conversion premium 
accordingly  the task force concluded that the treatment for diluted eps should not differ because of a contingent market price trigger 
the consensus reached by the task force should be applied to reporting periods ending after the effective date of october  for contingently convertible instruments outstanding at the date of adoption of this consensus and whose terms have not been modified since the date of issuance  prior period diluted earnings per share should be restated to conform to the guidance in this consensus for comparative purposes 
the date of adoption of this consensus is the end of the first reporting period after its effective date 
this eitf will apply to our million of convertible senior notes due  which were issued november  we have applied the guidance from eitf to our calculation of diluted shares and net income per diluted share for the quarter ended december  at december   the conversion feature of these notes was not in effect and the weighted average market price of our common stock did not exceed the conversion price of for dilution to occur 
accordingly  adoption of eitf did not affect our reported diluted shares or net income per diluted share in adoption of eitf may have an impact on our diluted shares and net income per diluted share in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and their related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that of our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the following should be read in conjunction with note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies and with the other notes to consolidated financial statements healthcare services revenue recognition and contractual adjustments our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and the provision of related nursing services to patients outside the hospital at alternate site settings 
most of this revenue is billed under managed care or other contracts  with a smaller amount billed under government healthcare programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
we bill upon receipt of all required documentation from payors  physicians and our staff 
at the end of any period  a portion of our earned revenue remains unbilled awaiting completion of all documentation requirements 
billed and unbilled revenue is recorded net of contractual adjustments based on our interpretation of the terms of each managed care contract or government contract or pricing schedule  as loaded into our computerized billing and pharmacy management software systems 
in most cases  our contractual adjustments are calculated automatically by our billing system when the claim is billed  subject to review by the biller 
if our billing system cannot automatically generate the contractual adjustment for a given claim  we calculate the contractual adjustment manually and key the adjustment into our billing system when the claim is billed 
the contractual adjustments on unbilled amounts must be estimated manually through claim by claim analysis of the unbilled claims  by applying historical contractual adjustment percentages to the gross unbilled amounts  or a combination of the two methods 
the accuracy of our recorded net revenue is subject to the accuracy of payor information on file for each patient  and is also subject to our correct interpretation of each underlying contract with respect to reimbursement rates for the drugs and services we provided 
if changes or corrections to our estimates of net revenue prove to be necessary  we adjust net revenue in the period that such changes or corrections are identified 
such adjustments may have a positive or negative impact on the revenues and results of operations reported for those subsequent periods 
historically  such adjustments have not been significant to our statements of income 
accounts receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are reported net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are due from private insurance carriers and government healthcare programs such as medicare or medicaid 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process  with each payor having its own claim requirements 
the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable is dependent upon complete and accurate patient intake  timely submission of clean claims to payors  and timely and effective follow up on outstanding claims 
our collection process involves multiple steps 
the first step is to bill each claim correctly  with proper coding  after having received all prerequisite authorizations from the patient s physician and insurance company  as applicable 
for claims submitted electronically  we receive electronic acceptance of the claim from the insurance company or governmental agency responsible for paying the claim 
this helps to assure collection of the account 
for mailed insurance claims or those for which electronic confirmation of acceptance is unavailable  the billing staff member responsible for that claim will contact the payor if payment is not received promptly 
the billing staff member will inquire as to the status of the claim  and will re bill the claim or provide additional information as requested by the payor 
upon rebilling  the billing staff member will contact the payor to confirm receipt of the re billed claim  and will follow up periodically until payment is received 
we write off accounts receivable as bad debts after all collection efforts have been exhausted  according to the following procedures 
our billing staff members review the status of their unpaid claims on a regular basis 
during that review  the billing staff member will identify the reason for non payment of a given claim 
should the reason relate to a correctable error with the claim itself  or incomplete or inadequate documentation provided to the payor  the billing staff member will attempt to address those issues and re submit a corrected claim or provide additional information to the payor  as appropriate 
in the event the claim error or documentation error cannot be corrected  the allowed time to correct and re submit the claim has expired  or the claim is not paid due to a payor related issue such as bankruptcy  the billing staff member will submit a formal request for write off 
the appropriate supervisor will review the request and authorize the claim to be written off if that supervisor agrees that the account is truly uncollectable 
the identity of the appropriate supervisor to authorize a write off is determined based on the reporting structure within each office and based on the dollar amount to be written off  with higher level authorization required for larger dollar write offs 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on several factors  including our past accounts receivable collection history  the aging of our accounts receivable at the end of each period as reported to us through our computerized billing systems  our mix of business  and the financial condition of our payors 
we evaluate historical write off percentages by aging category to help us determine the appropriate reserve needed at each balance sheet date based on the aging of our receivables at that date 
we also take into account certain internal factors  such as computer systems conversions  office acquisitions and consolidations  and operational changes within our billing and reimbursement function 
although we believe that our estimation of the net value of our accounts receivable is reasonable  we continually monitor our accounts receivable and our methods for calculating the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  and we adjust our allowances and calculation methods as needed 
if actual collections differ from our estimates  we may need to establish an additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
goodwill and other intangible assets we record goodwill from our acquisitions equal to the excess of the total cost of the acquisitions over the fair value of all identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  effective january  we no longer amortize goodwill but instead test our goodwill at least annually for impairment 
since we operate in one business segment  we test for goodwill impairment on a company wide basis 
therefore  our method of impairment testing consists of comparing the market value of our company to its book value 
the market value is equal to the current value per share of our common stock  times the total number of shares outstanding 
we test goodwill for impairment each october st  or whenever we identify events or conditions that could potentially result in impairment of our goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily consist of non compete agreements and managed care contracts 
these intangible assets are amortized straight line over periods ranging from two to five years 
their amortization period equals their estimated useful lives  or in the case of non compete agreements  the amortization period equals their contractual term 
computer software developed costs software developed for sale to external customers our subsidiary  mbi  has internally developed a computer software program  iemphsys  designed specifically for management of home infusion pharmacy businesses 
iemphsys has been designed both for external sale to independent home infusion businesses and for internal use by our company owned pharmacies 
we account for software designed for sale to external customers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
accordingly  the costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility for the software program have been capitalized 
these costs include coding and testing performed subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
capitalization of the software program costs ceased when the product became available for general release to customers 
the annual amortization expense for the software program is computed using the greater of a the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated life of the product  including the period being reported on 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized capitalized costs of the software program are compared to its net realizable value 
if the estimated net realizable value of the software program is less than its unamortized capitalized costs  we will write off the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceeds the net realizable value 
software developed for internal use only we have developed and are developing various software products designed only for use by us in the operation of our business 
such software development projects are accounted for in accordance with statement of position sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants 
we account for software development costs for internal use software accounting to the following criteria a computer software costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed  b once the capitalization criteria under the sop have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software  payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software project  and interest costs incurred when developing computer software for internal use are capitalized  and c once the product is operative  internal and external training costs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
we amortize capitalized costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software 
we will recognize impairment on the capitalized computer software developed for internal use  if one of the following conditions is present a the internal use software is not expected to provide substantive service potential  b a significant change occurs in the extent or manner in which the software is used or is expected to be used  c a significant change is made or will be made to the software program  and d costs of developing or modifying internal use computer software significantly exceed the amount originally expected to develop or modify the software 
vendor administration fees revenue we receive vendor administration fees and rebates from various vendors  pharmaceutical manufacturers and group purchasing organizations gpos based on the volume of drug and medical supply purchases made by us and our franchises 
our accounting for such administration fees and rebates is in accordance with the consensus reached in emerging issues task force eitf consideration received from a vendor by a customer or reseller 
a portion of the vendor administration fees and rebates that we receive is related to our purchases  while a lesser portion is earned from purchases made by our franchisees 
the portion related to our purchases is accounted for as a reduction to cost of goods sold in the period in which we completed the applicable purchases  while the portion related to purchases made by our franchisees is accounted for as revenue in our statements of income  because these rebates are not related to our cost of goods sold 
we also receive fees from certain biotech manufacturers for providing patient compliance and clinical outcomes data to them to aid in their evaluation of the efficacy of their products and treatment protocols 
these fees are not based on our purchase of product from these manufacturers  but rather based on the data we return to them 
since these fees relate to services that we are providing to the biotech manufacturers  we account for these fees as revenue in accordance with the guidance in eitf we often need to estimate the amount of our expected rebates and vendor administration and other fees earned in a given period based on our and our franchisees volume of purchases during the applicable period 
we may further need to estimate the allocation of rebates and vendor administration fees between revenue and cost of goods based on our estimation of the relative purchase made by us to purchases made by our franchisees during the applicable period 
likewise  we may need to estimate the fees due from biotech manufacturers based on the volume of patient compliance and clinical outcomes data that we have provided to them 
we may adjust our estimates in subsequent periods based on amounts paid by and supporting documentation received from our vendors and manufacturers 
such adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations in subsequent periods  though historically such adjustments have not been material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk primarily in relation to our cash and short term investments 
as of december   we had no variable rate debt 
in november  we completed an million offering of convertible senior notes due while the interest rate on this debt is fixed  the interest rate we may earn on the cash generated from this offering and from our operations is subject to market fluctuations 
we utilize a mix of investment maturities based on our anticipated cash needs and evaluation of existing interest rates and market conditions 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were as follows in thousands balance cash and cash equivalents cash cash equivalent investments total cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments cash equivalent investments consists of highly liquid investments having a maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition short term investments consists of commercial paper and other investments having a maturity of greater than three months at time of acquisition 
short term investments also consists of municipal variable rate demand notes  preferred stock and similar instruments with maturities greater than ten years  but which contain provisions for the periodic adjustment of interest rate to market  generally each or days 
while we attempt to minimize market risk and maximize return  changes in market conditions may significantly affect the income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
based on our actual cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances at december   a basis point decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income by  on an annualized basis
