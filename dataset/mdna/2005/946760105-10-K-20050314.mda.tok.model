the full realization of the tax benefit associated with the carry forward depends predominantly upon the company s ability to generate taxable income during the carry forward period 
the valuation allowance will be evaluated at the end of each reporting period  considering positive and negative evidence about whether the deferred tax asset will be realized 
at that time  the allowance will either be increased or reduced  reduction could result in the complete elimination of the allowance if positive evidence indicates that the value of the deferred tax assets is no longer impaired and the allowance is no longer required

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software and hardware for microcomputers  servers and networks upon shipment or upon electronic delivery of the product 
the company expenses the advertising costs associated with producing its catalogs 
the costs of these catalogs are expensed in the same month the catalogs are mailed 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write offs may be required 
page of the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
however  because of the current and expected future operating results of the company  we have concluded that a certain portion of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is no longer necessary and have accordingly reduced the allowance against the provision for taxes in the fiscal year ended december   as further discussed in note item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to its activities in the united states  of the company s sales were generated in canada 
we are subject to general risks attendant to the conduct of business in canada  including economic uncertainties and foreign government regulations 
in addition  the company s canadian business is subject to changes in demand or pricing resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors 
the company s million investments in marketable securities are only in highly rated and highly liquid us government securities and corporate bonds 
the remaining cash balance is invested in short term savings accounts with our primary bank  the bank of new york 
as such  the risk of significant changes in the value of our cash invested is minimal
