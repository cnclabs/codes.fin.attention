item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for customer sales information 
backlog our oem customers typically do not provide us firm purchase orders for delivery of products more than to days in advance 
in addition  these customers may reschedule or cancel firm orders with only minor penalty 
therefore  we do not believe that the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful determinant of future sales or current activity 

table of contents competition the ems industry includes many companies  several of which have substantial market share 
we also face competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally 
other ems companies compete with us depending on the type of service or geographic area customers require 
the basis of competition in our targeted markets is proven execution  reliability  superior manufacturing technology  price  flexibility  continuity of supply  quality  responsiveness  innovative and value adding services and ability to serve global customers 
associates as of august   we employed approximately  associates worldwide  which includes approximately  temporary associates 
patents and trademarks we hold certain united states and foreign patents and patent licenses relating to certain of the processes and equipment used in our manufacturing technology  as well as certain of the products which we have designed and manufactured 
in addition  we have registered trademarks service marks in the united states and various other countries throughout the world 
although we do not believe that our trademarks  manufacturing processes  patents or license rights to which we have access infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we cannot ensure that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
if such an assertion were to be made  it may become necessary or useful for us to enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve such an issue through litigation 
however  we cannot ensure that such license rights would be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or that any such litigation would be resolved favorably 
any litigation could be lengthy and costly and  regardless of its outcome  could materially harm our consolidated financial condition 
environmental matters we are required to comply with local  state  federal and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the treatment  storage  use  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing and service processes 
we are also required to comply with laws and regulations relating to occupational safety and health  product disposal and product content and labeling 
in general  we are not directly responsible for compliance with laws like weee and rohs 
these weee and rohs laws generally apply to our oem customers  solectron may  however  provide compliance related services to our customers upon request 
failing to have the capability of delivering products which comply with these present and future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand facilities  or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations  and could impair our relations with customers 
moreover  to the extent we are found non compliant with any environmental laws and regulations applicable to our activities  we may incur substantial fines and penalties 
we are committed to maintaining compliance in all of our facilities and to continuously improving our environmental practices 
we are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits for many of our facilities 
these permits  which must be renewed periodically  are subject to revocation if we violate environmental laws 
there can be no assurance that violations will not occur as a result of equipment failure  human error or other causes 
if a violation of environmental laws occurs  we could be held liable for damages  fines and costs of remedial actions  and our permits could be revoked 
any such revocation could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  and may adversely impact our results of operations 
we have been  and in the future may be  held liable for remediation of sites where our hazardous materials or those of companies we have acquired or divested have been disposed of 
we have environmental insurance in excess of reserves previously established to reduce potential environmental liability exposures posed by some of our current and former operations and facilities 
to date  these liabilities have not been substantial or material to our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we believe  based on our current knowledge  that the cost of any groundwater or soil clean up that may be required at any of our facilities would not materially harm our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
however  it is costly to remediate contamination  and there can be no assurance that any future remediation costs would not harm our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations
