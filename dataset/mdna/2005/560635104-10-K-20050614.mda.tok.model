item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been restated to give effect to the restatement discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with the airline industry 
see certain risk factors relating to the company and the airline industry in item year in review and outlook summary fiscal was a rebuilding year for the company 
after mesaba reached a new pilot agreement that extends through january and reaffirmed the jet agreement with northwest through april in late fiscal  mesaba brought the five grounded rjs back into service in the first quarter of fiscal and increased the utilization of that fleet 
traffic built steadily in the summer  but mesaba subsequently faced some very challenging weather and irregular operations in its hubs  especially in detroit  during the christmas and winter periods 
mesaba also focused on process discipline in the ground handling at its hub operations and began providing crj deicing and online luggage transfer for northwest at detroit 
by march  mesaba was focused on responding to a request for proposal from northwest for new seat regional jet operations 
separately  big sky initiated a fleet transition of its own from the metros to the beechcraft d 
big sky completed a new fleet campaign by putting the beechcraft d on its air carrier certificate in days 
outlook given the airline industry s continued economic uncertainty  the company s will focus its efforts in fiscal on three main strategies maintain outstanding operating performance at each subsidiary while the subsidiaries focus on the following initiatives mesaba mesaba will focus on finalizing a new omnibus airline services agreement with northwest  obtaining its crj certificate and bringing new aircraft into the fleet  starting in october with expected completion by march mesaba will continue to negotiate a new contract with its mechanics and dispatchers while simultaneously building contingency plans to ensure safe  reliable operations during potential labor unrest at northwest or mesaba big sky big sky will complete its fleet transition  retiring the remaining metros from operations  and expand its route structure by bringing five additional beechcraft ds into the fleet invest in a new fleet at mesaba which should improve the company s financial position and operating results in fiscal and beyond explore additional growth opportunities with existing subsidiaries and consider acquisitions to diversify in the airline industry 
fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  earnings summary the company reported net income of million or per diluted share for fiscal  compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal diluted weighted average common and potentially dilutive common shares were million and million in fiscal and mesaba mesaba operating revenues total operating revenues increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to incremental ground handling revenue due to mesaba s increased ground handling business in minneapolis and detroit 
this was partially offset by a decrease in passenger revenue as the reduction in saab flying more than offset the incremental rj flying year over year 
mesaba operating expenses total operating expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the cost per asm decreased to from 
the following table compares components of operating cost per asm for the years ended march wages and benefits aircraft fuel aircraft maintenance aircraft rents landing fees insurance and taxes depreciation and amortization administrative and other total wages and benefits increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal wages and benefits increased due to increased ground handling wages from additional ground handling activity  increased wages due to additional flying and the new pilots contract and increased costs related to the k benefit plan 
these increases were slightly offset by lower health and dental expenses resulting from improved experience 
year over year comparisons were also affected by the one time million retroactive pilot compensation expense in the prior year resulting from the pilots contract signed in january aircraft fuel decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is partially attributable to a decrease of in saab block hours flown 
in addition  there was a million decrease due to adjustments made to previously recorded accruals for estimated fuel expense 
certain provisions of the airlink agreement with northwest protect mesaba from changes in fuel prices 
mesaba s actual cost of fuel  including taxes and pumping fees  was cents per gallon in both fiscal and northwest is responsible for fuel for mesaba s rj operations 
aircraft maintenance costs  excluding wages and benefits  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal aircraft maintenance costs increased primarily due to a increase in rj block hours in fiscal and repair costs incurred to continue to maintain the fleet as it ages 
aircraft rents decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is attributable to four fewer saab aircraft in service year over year 
landing fees decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction of saab departures partially offset by airport rate increases during fiscal northwest is responsible for landing fees for mesaba s rj operations 
insurance and taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to fewer insured aircraft and a reduction in the rates charged for hull and passenger liability insurance  as well as the recognition of property tax refunds of million 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the lower level of depreciation and amortization resulted from reduced capital spending over the last several years 
administrative and other expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to increased outside services of million related to consulting and audit costs incurred to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and increased tsa fees 
in addition  the increase was due to costs associated with irregular operations of approximately million 
these increased costs were offset by reduced costs related to third party saab ground handling of million and pilot training of million 
big sky big sky operating revenues total operating revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to a reduction in flying unprofitable routes  resulting in a million decrease in passenger revenue  partially offset by a million increase in eas subsidies 
big sky operating expenses total operating expenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal primarily due to the reduced flying year over year  which were offset by million costs associated with the permanent grounding of four metro aircraft three due to the fleet transition from metros to beechcraft ds and one due to significant aircraft damage 
consolidated operating income operating income totaled million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the company s operating margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal consolidated nonoperating income nonoperating income net decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the government grant of million in fiscal  which was partially offset by increased interest income of million earned on the company s investments in fiscal consolidated provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s blended effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company received verification of a final settlement with the internal revenue service concerning its examination of the company s fiscal and income tax returns 
as a result of this settlement  the company reduced its income tax payable and tax provision by million 
without this one time adjustment  the company s effective tax rate would have been in fiscal the company adjusts its effective tax rate quarterly based on forecasted operating results in the fiscal year 
the rate is affected principally by the level of nondeductible expenses relative to projected taxable income 
fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  earnings summary the company reported net income of million or per diluted share for fiscal  compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal diluted weighted average common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding were million and million in fiscal and on december   the company acquired all the outstanding shares of big sky and accounted for the transaction using the purchase method of accounting 
the company has consolidated big sky s results of operations from the acquisition date to march  for fiscal  big sky generated operating revenues of million and operating expenses of million 
due to the fact that year over year and full year information for big sky is not included  a detailed discussion of big sky s operating results and statistics is not presented 
mesaba operating revenues total operating revenues decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the decrease is attributable to a decrease of approximately in completed saab asms due to the return of six saab a model aircraft  the grounding of five rj aircraft from december to march and the temporary shutdown of service during final pilot negotiations in january that resulted in the cancellation of flights 
mesaba operating expenses total operating expenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the cost per asm decreased to from 
the following table compares components of operating cost per asm for the years ended march wages and benefits aircraft fuel aircraft maintenance aircraft rents landing fees insurance and taxes depreciation and amortization administrative and other total wages and benefits increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of the new alpa contract  which included million in retroactive pay  which was partially offset by productivity improvement in maintenance and customer service 
also contributing to the variance were significant increases in health and dental insurance and workers compensation costs 
aircraft fuel decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is attributable primarily to a decrease of in the number of saab block hours flown  favorable fuel burn rates and fuel credits received in fiscal certain provisions of the airlink agreement with northwest protect mesaba from changes in fuel prices 
mesaba s actual cost of fuel  including taxes and pumping fees  was cents per gallon in both fiscal and northwest is responsible for fuel for mesaba s rj operations 
aircraft maintenance costs  excluding wages and benefits  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal aircraft maintenance costs decreased primarily due to a reduction in flight hours flown in fiscal and a reduction in aircraft damage expenses 
aircraft rents decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is attributable to fewer aircraft in service year over year 
landing fees decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction of saab departures during fiscal northwest is responsible for landing fees for mesaba s rj operations 
insurance and taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in the rates charged for hull and passenger liability insurance and favorable property tax credits 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the lower level of depreciation and amortization resulted from reduced capital spending over the last several years 
the reduction is because less capital expenditure is required to maintain the fleet versus investing in the infrastructure to grow the fleet in previous fiscal years 
administrative and other expenses remained relatively constant  increasing to million in fiscal from million in fiscal consolidated operating income operating income totaled million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the company s operating margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal consolidated nonoperating income nonoperating income net increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal nonoperating income represents a government grant of million and interest income earned on the company s investments 
fiscal nonoperating income represents the offsetting impact of the recognition of a million writedown of an investment in a worldcom bond and interest income earned on the company s remaining investments 
consolidated provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s blended effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate decreased primarily due to deducting certain meals and entertainment expenses that were previously treated as nondeductible expenses 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments increased to million at march  from million at march  the company s working capital increased to million with a current ratio of at march  compared to million and at march  investments consist principally of municipal securities and are classified as available for sale 
available for sale investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
the company classifies investments with an original maturity of more than days that mature within one year as short term and greater than one year as long term 
the company reclassified its investments in auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short or long term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets depending upon the original maturity date 
these auction rate securities  which have interest rate resets every days or less but maturity dates of greater than days  were previously included in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of million at march  the auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at cost  which approximates market value 
the reclassifications had no impact on the company s previously reported results of operations 
approximately of the company s accounts receivable balance as of march  was due from northwest and this receivable is not collateralized 
the company s business is sensitive to events and risks affecting northwest 
northwest has incurred significant losses in the last several years  including a net loss of million in and a net loss of million in the first quarter of if northwest continues to incur operating losses  it may be unable to fulfill its financial obligations  including payments due to mesaba under the airlink agreement and jet agreement 
loss of mesaba s affiliation with northwest or northwest s failure to make timely payment of amounts owed to mesaba or to otherwise materially perform under the airlink or jet agreement for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at march  from million at march  a summary of cash flow activity is as follows operating activities net cash provided by operations in fiscal was million 
the primary sources of cash were from operations  which generated million of net income and million of non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization 
the changes to current operating items resulted in a use of cash of million 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities in fiscal was million 
cash that was generated from operations was the funding source for investing activities 
the primary uses were net purchases of short and long term investments of million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million 
this was primary due to the repayment of noncurrent liabilities of million  which was offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of options of million 
outlook the company has historically relied on cash and cash equivalents  investments and internally generated funds to support its working capital requirements 
absent adverse factors outside the control of the company  management believes current liquidity and funds from operations will provide adequate resources for meeting current operations  investment in the new crj fleet and non aircraft capital needs for fiscal contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements as of march   mesaba s fleet consisted of aircraft covered under operating leases with remaining terms of up to years and aggregate monthly lease payments of approximately million 
mesaba leases its saab aircraft  either directly from aircraft leasing companies  through pinnacle under operating leases with initial terms of up to seven years or through subleases with northwest under operating leases with initial terms of up to years 
mesaba leases its rj aircraft from northwest under operating leases with initial terms of up to ten years 
mesaba believes that its revenues from the airlink and jet agreements will continue to be sufficient to fund its aircraft lease obligations 
if the airlink agreement terminates  then the saab aircraft leases will simultaneously terminate 
likewise  if the jet agreement terminates  then the rj aircraft leases will simultaneously terminate 
as of march   big sky s fleet consisted of aircraft covered under operating leases with remaining terms of seven months to months and aggregate monthly lease payments of approximately million 
big sky leases eight of its aircraft from leasing companies and five from air midwest  a subsidiary of mesa air group 
big sky will lease an additional five beechcraft ds in fiscal five of the metro leases allow big sky to return the aircraft to the lessor upon the occurrence of certain events and contain purchase options 
funding of the monthly minimum lease payments is dependent on continued passenger boardings  big sky s operations and  potentially  funding from the company 
the company s airline fleet operating leases do not contain any guaranteed lease residual provisions for which there would be a potential contingency at the termination of the lease period 
the following table summarizes the company s commitments to make long term debt and lease payments for the years ending march  in thousands thereafter total operating leases aircraft non aircraft long term debt capital lease total amounts represent minimum lease payments with initial or remaining terms of more than one year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of operating leases 
amounts are based on lease terms  which have early terminations and extensions 
the saab leases have initial terms of up to years with early terminations 
the rj leases have initial terms of up to ten years with extensions 
amounts represent principal payments only 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long term debt and future maturities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the capital lease 
an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has i guarantees  ii a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  iii an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or iv any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company has no arrangements of the types described that may have a material current or future effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company has identified its critical accounting policies to include those discussed in the following paragraphs 
the company also has other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items 
management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  based on information presently available  however  changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and accordingly actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
aircraft property and equipment estimated lives are used to record depreciation on aircraft property and equipment 
aircraft utilization  airlink and jet agreement contractual lives  technology and changes in business strategy may affect the economic lives used to record depreciation by mesaba or big sky 
the foregoing may also affect depreciation rates  impairment or both 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review the estimated useful lives and salvage values for aircraft property and equipment 
excess and obsolete inventories estimated recovery percentages are used to record obsolescence reserves for parts inventories 
aircraft utilization  parts availability and changes in parts cost may affect the valuation of parts inventories and obsolescence reserve levels 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review recovery percentages  reserve levels and inventory valuations for parts inventories 
aircraft maintenance estimated maintenance costs and anticipated aircraft activity are used to determine maintenance reserves 
changes in maintenance contracts  parts and labor costs and aircraft activity may affect the maintenance reserves 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review airplane activity  expected aircraft return dates  changes in its maintenance contracts and parts and labor costs for maintenance reserves 
goodwill and other intangible assets the excess of the big sky purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired was allocated to certain identifiable intangible assets  including big sky s pilot labor contract and its air carrier certificate and goodwill 
the recoverability of goodwill million and other intangible assets million is evaluated annually  at a minimum  or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amounts 
the evaluation includes future cash flow projections  strategic modeling and other management assumptions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that no impairment charge was necessary 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  and the company s effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized  or expected to be recognized  in the company s operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
the company establishes reserves when  despite its belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not succeed 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as related interest 
this rate is then applied to the company s quarterly operating results 
workers compensation insurance the company estimates the ultimate cost of an on the job injury at the time of the injury to determine its workers compensation insurance reserves 
the company uses the services of its insurance carrier and outside broker to assist in determining the reserve levels 
injury severity  cost of care and the insurance contract affect the ultimate cost and ultimate reserves recorded 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review workers compensation activity with outside consultants for any changes in the workers compensation reserve 
health and dental insurance the company estimates the amount of incurred but not reported health and dental claims to determine its health and dental insurance reserves 
the company uses the services of its insurance carrier and outside broker to assist in determining the reserve levels 
historical claims experience  claims severity and cost of care affect the ultimate cost and ultimate reserves recorded 
management of mesaba and big sky regularly review health and dental claims activity with outside consultants for any changes in the health and dental insurance reserve 
property taxes estimated property tax values and assessments are used to record property tax reserves for the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
aircraft and parts values  aircraft flight activity  ground equipment values and the location of personnel may affect the ultimate property tax obligation 
management of mesaba and big sky periodically review the above items for any changes in the property tax reserves 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires all public companies accounting for share based payment transactions to account for these types of transactions using a fair value based method 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r also requires the tax benefits associated with these shared based payments to be classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flows rather than operating activities as is currently permitted 
sfas no 
r becomes effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  the company expects to adopt sfas no 
r on april  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  the company will record compensation expense for all awards it grants on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
in addition  the company will record compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of the adoption 
the company has not completed its assessment of the impact of the standard on its financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risks are the availability and price of jet fuel and changes in interest rates 
the company believes its arrangements for fuel  primarily with northwest  assure an adequate supply of fuel for current and future operations for both mesaba and big sky  provided that northwest does not experience a supply shortage 
as a part of the airlink agreement  northwest bears the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations for mesaba s fuel requirements 
as part of the jet agreement  northwest provides all fuel at its expense to support mesaba s rj operations 
big sky is subject to fluctuations in fuel prices  but currently fuel expense is not a material cost in relation to the company s total operating expenses 
the company expects that its results of operations will not be materially affected by fuel price volatility 
the company does not hold long term interest sensitive assets and therefore is not exposed to significant interest rate fluctuations for its assets 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
