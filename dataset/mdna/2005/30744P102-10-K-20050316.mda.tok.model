such factors may include  among others  those factors listed in item a and elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of printing systems and consumable supplies that personalize plastic identification cards by printing images and text onto the card 
our printing systems are capable of encoding data onto cards that incorporate bar code  magnetic stripe  smart card or proximity card technology 
we believe that our engineering expertise and our ability to offer a broad range of printing systems using multiple printing technologies have led to a reputation for innovation in our industry 
we believe that we are the only manufacturer in our industry to offer three distinct technologies in printing systems high definition printing reverse image  traditional direct to card printing dye sublimation and cardjet printing technology inkjet to personalize plastic identification cards  complete with digital images and text  lamination and electronically encoded information 
we believe there are between and companies manufacturing digital card printers 
the great majority of these are offering direct to card dye sublimation printers 
we believe our high definition printing platform currently has two competitors and we are not aware of any other company offering an inkjet solution for printing plastic identification cards 
concern for personal safety and property protection has led to the need for electronic and visual identification and access control 
we believe the demand for our products will increase as governments and corporations worldwide address their security needs 
we believe the development and implementation of new technologies that add security features to plastic cards should foster a growing market for our systems 
we market and sell our products exclusively through a distribution channel of system integrators and independent distributors in more than countries worldwide 
we estimate that as of december   we have manufactured and sold more than  of our printing systems 
end users of our printing systems create personalized cards for a wide variety of applications including corporate security and access  driver s licenses  government and military identification  student identification and access  public transportation access  and recreation and gaming 
we sell both printing systems and consumable supplies used in those systems 
we produce a diverse array of card printing systems that allow us to meet the needs of end users  ranging from those who desire a premium system to address complex applications to those focused on lower priced systems with fewer features 
we also sell consumable supplies that are used with our systems  including dye sublimation ribbons  overlaminates  thermal resin ribbons  printheads  inkjet cartridges  inkjet card cartridges and blank cards 
over the past six years  the proportion of our total revenues provided by consumable supplies has increased to of total revenues in from in factors affecting our net sales of card printing systems each year include the mix of systems sold  changes in average selling price and the number of major projects we are successful in winning 
as the number of fargo systems installed and in use continues to grow  it is our belief that the sale of consumable supplies for use in these systems will provide us with a significant recurring  and growing revenue stream 
our markets can be categorized in three broad tiers entry level  mid level and high level 
we have historically been successful in each of these markets 
end users in the entry level market are typically using a simple photo identification card 
users in this market are likely more focused on lower priced systems with fewer features 
users in the mid level tier typically would add functionality such as access control or time and attendance recording features 
at the high end of our markets are government and government related projects and corporate security programs with multi level requirements  which typically will use a much more sophisticated and complex identification card and are projects where the end user is looking for the highest levels of functionality and security 
examples of government and government related projects include national identification programs  military programs and driver s license programs 
these projects typically span multiple years and involve integrating solutions into complex existing infrastructures 
the printer component of these projects is typically only a small piece of the overall project 
while the company actively pursues such project business  these projects are very competitive and it is very difficult to predict the timing of the bid process  funding and implementation of any such projects 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in net sales and gross profit as a result of a number of factors  including  among other things  the timing and extent of promotional pricing  the timing of major projects  changes in average selling prices  the number and mix of products sold in the quarter  the availability and cost of components and materials  costs  benefits and timing of new product introductions  customer order size and shipment timing  and seasonable factors affecting timing of purchase orders 
in october  we introduced a new distribution program for our united states channel partners 
the new program categorizes distribution partners into four complementary  yet separate  program tracks 
fargo solution providers provide retail customers with sales  service and integration expertise on fargo s full line of professional and persona series products and systems 
fargo value added distributors provide in depth integration expertise and support for fargo solution providers and end user customers on fargo s full line of products and systems 
fargo distributors provide product distribution services to fargo solution providers and persona series resellers 
fargo manufacturing resellers are companies that have a core business of developing and manufacturing products where the sale of identification card printers is a secondary portion of its sale 
each category has the option to work exclusively with fargo to develop market share and expertise in the markets they serve 
the program continues our two product line strategy with restricted distribution on our professional series products and broad distribution of our persona products 
the new program resulted from a review of our existing and future channel requirements  our distribution partners needs and the products that are under development by us 
we believe that this new distribution structure is working well with our distribution partners 
in the second half of  we began making additional investments in the infrastructure of our business  resulting in an increase in operating expenses 
the purpose of these investments is to position ourselves better to capitalize on anticipated market opportunities for our products and to grow our revenue in the future 
it is our intention to continue to make these investments 
we also anticipate continued legal expenses in connection with patent litigation we have initiated 
we currently expect our future operating expenses to increase at a faster rate than the increases we have experienced in the past 
we believe these expenditures will enhance the future growth of the company for our shareholders  however  the anticipated growth cannot be assured and our operating income may be negatively affected

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations  debt service and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations 
working capital was million  million and million at december    and  respectively 
during  we repaid million of bank debt 
at december  and throughout and  we had no bank debt outstanding 
we believe  based on our current cash levels as well as the operating cash flows expected in and the funds available to us under our million revolving credit facility  that we will have sufficient funds to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   an increase of million from million at december  this increase is mainly due to positive net cash flows provided by our operating activities in cash generated from operating activities in totaled million due to net income of million  non cash charges of million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the non cash charges are primarily for deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities relate primarily to an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventory of million  offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million

cash used by investing activities was million exclusively for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash provided by financing activities was  due to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options during in april  we further amended our million revolving credit facility  on which there was no outstanding balance at december  or at any point during and as a result of this amendment  the credit facility will automatically renew at the end of its term for a period of days unless either party delivers a non renewal notice 
the amendment also eliminated the unused commitment fee 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to eligible accounts receivable and inventories  as defined by the agreement 
under the terms of the amendment  we may borrow at the prime rate of interest or libor plus a margin of 
the credit facility requires  among other things  the maintenance of a minimum ebitda and restricts our ability to pay dividends or incur new operating lease expenditures  as defined in the agreement 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total operating lease 
we lease our office  warehouse and manufacturing space under an operating lease that expires in december total rent expense for this operating lease was   and  during  and  respectively 
purchase obligations 
purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
of this amount   relates to unconditional purchase agreements that the company has entered into with certain suppliers 
these agreements are reviewed on a semi annual basis  and  unless terminated by either party  automatically renew for an additional six month period 
the agreements may be terminated by either party with a day written notice 
purchase obligations also include an agreement to purchase million a year of materials under a ten year agreement with one of our suppliers which expires in our obligation to meet this commitment is conditional upon the supplier continuing to meet a number of obligations set out in the agreement 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based upon the information available to us  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition revenue is recognized when product has been shipped  risk of loss has passed to the purchaser and we have fulfilled all of our obligations 
we provide for promotional discounts  estimated early payment discounts  estimated warranty costs and estimated returns in the period the related revenue is recognized 
certain of our customers have arrangements which include limited stock balancing return provisions 
we provide an allowance for stock balance returns based on estimated expected returns 
sales to these customers represented  and of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
under the terms of the stock balancing agreements  the maximum amount of returns is approximately  at december   of which we have recorded an allowance of  for estimated returns 
this reserve is included in our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we make marketing development funds available to our resellers to support demand generation activity by the resellers 
we treat payment of these funds as marketing costs up to the fair value of the benefit received where we receive an identifiable benefit and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received in accordance with the requirements of eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
any payments to resellers that do not meet these requirements  including any promotional discounts for the purchase of product  are recorded as reductions to revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we determine the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns considering a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the accounts receivable  analysis of stock balancing agreements and specific information obtained by us on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of our customers 
if the financing conditions of our customers were to deteriorate and reduce the ability of our customers to make payments on their accounts  we may be required to increase our allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
likewise  should the financial condition of our customers improve and result in payments or settlements of previously reserved amounts  we may be required to record a reduction in bad debt expense to reverse the recorded allowance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns was  at december  allowance for excess and obsolete inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture  or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve and twenty four month periods 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventories and reported operating results 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories at december   was  warranty accrual our products are generally covered by a standard one year warranty from the date of sale 
estimated warranty costs are accrued in the same period in which the related revenue is recognized  based on anticipated parts and labor costs  utilizing historical experience 
our warranty accrual at december   was  deferred tax assets the realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income which we believe is more likely than not 
historically  we have generated operating income and we anticipate future taxable income sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets 
future taxable income is based on our forecasts of operating results  and there can be no assurance that such results will be achieved 
our deferred tax assets at december  were recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs 
an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  sfas requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we believe the adoption of sfas will not have any material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that the cost of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
that cost will be recognized as an expense over the vesting period of the award 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas which are shown in note to our financial statements on page f no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
in addition  we will be required to determine fair value in accordance with sfas r 
sfas r is effective for reporting periods beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged  and requires the application of a transition methodology for stock options that have not vested as of the date of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas r on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fsp fas  application of fasb no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp fas no 
clarifies sfas no 
s guidance that applies to the new tax deduction for qualified domestic production activities 
fsp no 
became effective upon issuance and we believe that this pronouncement will have an insignificant impact on our effective tax rate in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
market risk is attributed to all market sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt 
interest rate risk we are potentially exposed to market risk from interest rate changes in our credit agreement 
under the terms of our credit agreement  we may borrow at the prime rate of interest or libor plus a margin of 
for borrowings under our credit agreement  we typically lock into a fixed interest rate for periods between to days 
at december  and throughout  we had no borrowings outstanding 
foreign currency risk we denominate all foreign sales in us dollars and do not hedge against currency fluctuations 
we purchase components and supplies from several japanese suppliers 
to date  currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition  but could in the future by causing our products to become less affordable or less price competitive than those of foreign manufacturers or by causing the costs of our material supplies to increase 
we make all of our purchases in us dollars and we believe that we have reduced the risks of increased purchasing costs that would otherwise occur if the dollar weakens relative to the yen 
we have foregone the opportunity  however  to benefit from the full potential cost savings if the dollar strengthens relative to the yen
