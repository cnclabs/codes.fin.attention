many dvds also offer special features  enhancements and ancillary materials  such as special menu design  multiple audio tracks  behind the scenes footage  director commentaries  interviews and discographies  all of which we are able to develop in house 
exclusive acquisition 
we generally acquire exclusive rights to our content 
our active catalog currently contains over  exclusive dvd titles and over exclusive cd titles 
we currently release an average of new exclusive dvd titles and five new exclusive cd titles each month 
we acquire our exclusive titles from a wide range of content holders  including independent content suppliers  producers  music artists  record labels and artist management  and also produce our own original entertainment content focused on dvd live performance stand up comedy  music concerts and urban genre content  and in light of our agreements with dark horse entertainment and contentfilm  feature horror and other genre titles 
we produce  market and sell our exclusive content according to exclusive license or distribution agreements 
we actively pursue and secure both domestic us and canada and international distribution rights to exclusive titles 
in return for exclusive license rights  we pay royalties to our licensors 
royalties are expressed as a percentage of our wholesale net revenues derived from title sales 
typically  we pay royalty advances that are recouped against royalties earned on a title by title basis or  if cross collateralized  against groups of licensed titles from the same licensor 
our license agreements generally provide for a minimum distribution term of at least five years and often considerably longer 
some license agreements contain provisions for an extension of the distribution term if we meet specified performance milestones 
in return for exclusive distribution rights  we generally tender net wholesale revenues to content suppliers  which are expressed as a percentage of wholesale revenues after subtracting our distribution fee and recouping costs allocated to the content owner such as production  manufacturing  music publishing  and marketing fees 
in some cases  the net profit of a title is split between us and the content supplier according to a contractual percentage 
in many such cases  advances or minimum guarantees on an exclusive distribution deal are paid and recouped by us similar to an exclusive licensing arrangement 
under our exclusive license and distribution arrangements  we often secure the right to distribute entertainment content in a range of home entertainment formats  which may include dvd vhs cd universal media disc umd for the sony playstation portable psp other home video formats to a lesser extent  we also pursue and secure exclusive broadcast rights which include exploitation via broadcast television cable satellite pay per view in flight radio other broadcast media through egami media  we also acquire exclusive digital content and are beginning to exploit it via video on demand vod streaming video download channels while our core business remains the domestic acquisition and distribution of content on dvd  we seek to secure and exploit exclusive content from the broadest possible grant of home entertainment programming rights 
as part of our strategic goal to secure the broadest possible range of exploitation rights for exclusive programming  we may finance all or part of the production of some of our entertainment content 
the rights we retain in connection with our self financed productions generally cover all territories throughout the world  all now known and hereafter devised video home entertainment formats  and other formats including broadcast  audio  in flight  internet streaming  digital downloading  direct response  sponsorship and bundling rights  for an extended term 
because of our growing library of exclusive titles in a wide variety of genres  we believe that we are positioned to benefit from the market growth of the dvd format 
we intend to continue expansion of our exclusive dvd library 
in january  we perfected formation of a wholly owned subsidiary  image entertainment uk  inc on february   image uk opened a content acquisition office in london  england 
our vice president of programming temporarily relocated to london to become the office s managing director 
image uk acts as our exclusive content acquisition agent  and facilitates the securing of licensing and distribution rights from content providers from its overseas headquarters 
rights acquired with the assistance of image uk will be held by us 
additionally  production and distribution services will be performed by our personnel out of our headquarters in chatsworth  california 
we expect first year expenses for the leased office  leased apartment which is temporarily leased through july   and related expenses  including salaries  to be approximately  approximately  per month 
egami media 
our wholly owned subsidiary  egami media  engages in the exclusive wholesale distribution of the digital rights to our catalogue of audio and video content 
while many top grossing  popular movie titles are available online  only a relatively small number of niche or affinity video titles such as classic television shows  live music  comedy clips and other programming are available today 
egami seeks to differentiate itself competitively by being a one stop source for the large  diverse collection of entertainment represented by our digital catalogue  which currently includes over  music tracks and over video titles and episodes 
egami enters into nonexclusive video distribution arrangements with retail and consumer entities whose business models include digital delivery of content 
delivery will be in the form of secure encoded files with playback options being controlled by embedded digital rights management drm 
the consumer will find various purchasing options that include download to own vod subscription vod download to own is essentially the digital equivalent of buying a dvd 
vod is essentially the digital equivalent of renting a dvd 
subscription vod is essentially the digital equivalent of a club type model  where users pay recurring monthly fees in exchange for access to a larger library without individual transaction charges 
in the audio market  egami is entering into nonexclusive distribution arrangements with retail and consumer entities whose business models include digital delivery of content 
the audio marketplace is more mature  yet audio business models continue to evolve 
egami is selling full albums as well as individual tracks from our library of content 
we are also seeing various subscription models emerge  and we intend to support them 
film production 
with dark horse  we have completed principal photography and are in post production on two feature films  splinter  a multicultural action adventure supernatural thriller starring edward james olmos and tom sizemore which we may consider for theatrical exploitation  and monarchs of the moon  a stylized feature designed to pay homage to the classic science fiction movies of the s 
through dark horse  we acquired destination mars  a feature similar to monarchs of the moon 
we are currently in development on a haunted house script currently entitled gone  based on a short story from the dark horse book of hauntings  written and to be directed by famed director john landis american werewolf in london  animal house  beverly hills cop iii  blues brothers  coming to america  into the night  kentucky fried movie  trading places 
we have also begun development of two additional dark horse projects  one currently entitled driftwood  a ghost story about a boys reformatory  and a yet to be titled project starring  written and directed by renowned genre actor bruce campbell 
our agreement with contentfilm has focused primarily on content acquisition  as the co production portion of our agreement has been assigned to ed pressman productions  controlled by highly successful independent film producer ed pressman bad lieutenant  conan the barbarian  the cooler  the crow  das boot  sisters  talk radio 
with contentfilm  we have acquired feature films evil aliens and wilderness survival for girls 
with ed pressman  we are in discussions to develop the remake of brian de palma s sisters and other films 
nonexclusive distribution 
we do not generally distribute nonexclusive content  including dvd releases of major motion pictures 
however  at the request of seven of our largest domestic accounts aec one stop group  best buy  borders  musicland group inc  tower records video  trans world entertainment and virgin  we act as a nonexclusive supplier to them for three lines of smaller independent content 
additional services 
we provide a variety of value added services relative to our licensed content and many of our exclusively distributed titles  including creation of packaging  dvd authoring and compression  menu design  video master quality control  manufacturing  marketing  sales  music clearance  warehousing  distribution  and  for some titles  the addition of enhancements such as multiple audio tracks  commentaries  foreign language tracks  and other ancillary materials such as behind the scenes footage  interviews and discographies 
these services are typically performed in house  with the exception of dvd  cd and umd disc manufacturing and tape replication  package printing  and packaging of the finished product which are generally performed by third party vendors 
manufacturing 
typically  a content supplier delivers a title master and artwork to us  and our in house post production facility creates a sub master with specifications for the necessary format and on screen menus for each title 
our in house authoring and compression team then generally performs the work necessary to prepare a dvd master for manufacturing 
occasionally  because of the large volume of our exclusive releases  we may use an outside facility to perform such services 
our in house creative services department  staffed with graphic designers  copywriters and proofreaders  creates original and innovative packaging fundamental to the marketing success of our product 
deluxe media services  inc  formerly ritek global media  manufactures and packages our domestic dvd programming 
we use two other vendors for cd manufacturing  l m optical west and sony dadc global 
sony dadc global currently manufactures all umd programming 
marketing

our marketing efforts involve point of sale advertising print advertising in trade and consumer publications national television and radio advertising campaigns minimal direct response campaigns dealer incentive programs trade show exhibits bulletins featuring new releases and catalogue promotions we also have account specific marketing programs where we work directly with retailers to optimize and customize print advertising and other advertising programs to promote our exclusive product 
the creation of specialized in store displays and celebrity appearances are other examples of account specific marketing programs 
we occasionally implement internet promotional activities that include product tie ins  sweepstakes  and giveaways associated with online retail customers  and the creation of genre specific boutiques within direct to consumer web sites 
we maintain a web site at www 
image entertainment 
com to help promote us and our exclusive content 
the web site includes investor information  such as press releases  information regarding our exclusive titles  and information of general interest to the home entertainment consumer 
the content of this site does not constitute a part of this report 
customers 
we typically distribute our titles domestically through our las vegas  nevada distribution center 
we sell our product to retailers internet retailers distributors alternative distribution direct to consumer print catalogs direct response campaigns subscription service club sales home shopping television channels other non traditional sales channels we sell directly to many large and small retailers 
some of our key sell through customers include aec one stop group amazon 
com  inc anderson merchandisers best buy co  inc handleman company ingram entertainment  inc musicland group inc target tower records trans world entertainment vidcanada in addition  we sell to rental retail hybrid customers such as blockbuster inc hollywood entertainment corporation movie gallery  inc netflix  inc over the last several years  many of our sell through dvd customers have helped grow our audio revenues 
our special markets division is designed to take advantage of our large and diverse catalog and specifically targets niche sales opportunities 
special markets retailers to whom we have sold product include barjan big lots columbia house crutchfield corporation discovery channel doubleday guitar center hot topic ksg distribution metropolitan opera guild qvc  inc on a consolidated basis  anderson merchandisers who supplies wal mart  best buy and aec one stop accounted for  and  respectively  of our fiscal net revenues 
best buy and aec one stop accounted for and  respectively  of our fiscal net revenues  and best buy  which included its then subsidiary musicland group until its sale in june  accounted for of our fiscal net revenues 
no other customers accounted for net revenues individually in excess of of our total net revenues for fiscal  or we allow retail customers to return a portion of their unsold inventory on a quarterly basis 
we reserve for estimated returns at the time the sale is recognized  based in part upon our historical returns experience and knowledge of specific product movement within distribution channels 
our inventory returns  as a percentage of our gross distribution as opposed to net revenues  were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively 
returns of defective product have been minimal and are generally covered by manufacturers warranties 
as of june   we had approximately million of backlog orders  from dvd product  from domestic wholesale customers compared with approximately million of backlog orders  from dvd product  as of june  we expect to fill of the backlog orders  less any cancelled orders  this fiscal year 
international international sublicensing 
we have an exclusive sublicense agreement for our dvd content  primarily music related dvds  with bmg music international service  gmbh now known as sony bmg for europe  africa  and most of the middle east  an exclusive subdistribution agreement with sony bmg for mexico and central america  and an exclusive sublicense agreement with digital site  an affiliate of ray corporation  for japan 
we have an exclusive sublicense agreement with the warner music group for australia and new zealand 
these agreements contain terms and conditions similar to those governing our underlying rights agreements 
sony bmg  digital site and warner music pay royalties based on either retail or wholesale revenues they generate  and are responsible for sales  taxes  marketing  publishing  manufacturing except for mexico and central america  where we provide finished goods and distribution of our content in their respective territories 
we have similar sublicenses with others for smaller territories 
worldwide broadcast 
buyers of our standard and high definition broadcast content are typically cable  pay per view  or satellite broadcasters  and sometimes terrestrial free television or in flight broadcasters 
under a typical broadcast license we receive payment of a one time  fixed  non refundable fee for a multi year exploitation term and in many instances for a specified number of airings 
with respect to pay per view  we typically receive a non refundable advance against royalties that are based on a percentage of customer buys 
our obligations under broadcast licensing are usually only to provide a broadcast master of the title and to ensure that music synchronization rights are secured 
we have an exclusive sales agency agreement with london based nbd television ltd for worldwide broadcast television sublicenses of the majority of the current catalogue of programming for which we hold broadcast rights in excess of programs as well as our new release acquisitions which include broadcast rights 
nbd represents us for conventional television broadcast sales  whether standard or high definition  including cable  pay per view  video on demand  satellite television  and sales to non theatrical venues 
programs that were sublicensed to third parties for broadcast prior to january will be handled by nbd upon the expiration of the existing licenses 
the agreement with nbd expires in january cost structure our most significant costs and cash expenditures relate to acquiring content for exclusive distribution and  more recently  the funding of content production or co production for exclusive distribution 
agreements to acquire programming typically come in the form of either an exclusive license agreement  where we pay royalties for the exclusive distribution rights  or an exclusive distribution agreement  where we generally receive distribution fees and pay net profits after recoupment of our upfront costs 
we generally base our offers of advances against future royalties or  for distribution agreements  advances against future net profit payments and in many cases production funding on the expected success of a title s performance at retail  actual cost of the production  and competition for the title s exclusive distribution rights 
upon entering into a typical exclusive license agreement  we pay  in advance  royalties which normally become due to the content supplier days following the quarter which the sale of dvd  cd  umd and vhs units of the title to our retail customers has occurred 
royalties are contractually expressed as a percentage of net revenues 
upon our recoupment of the advance  we pay the content supplier royalty overages at the same rate 
if we do not recoup our initial advance by the end of the agreement s term  the content supplier receives no additional royalties but is not typically liable for reimbursement of our unrecouped advance 
royalty advances may be used by the content supplier to actually produce the content in cases where the content has not yet been created 
under these exclusive license agreements  we are responsible for manufacturing  packaging  menu design  authoring and compression  package design and layout  selling  marketing and distribution expenses  and sometimes for music publishing in the case of music related dvds and cds 
under a typical exclusive distribution agreement  we may pay upfront fees  which are expressed as advances against future net profits  or we may pay for the cost of the content s production in advance 
our net profits for these deals usually take the form of our distribution fee which is deducted first 
any remaining net profits after we recoup our incurred costs and additional costs such as the cost of the content s production are generally paid to the content supplier 
we may also split any remaining net profits with the content supplier according to contractual percentages 
if net profits are not achieved  the content supplier receives only the production costs or distribution fees advanced  if any 
again  we recoup our incurred costs before any net profit disbursement is made to the content supplier 
in addition to advances  upfront fees and production costs  the other significant costs we incur are for dvd and cd replication packaging advertising  promotion  and market development funds provided retail customers domestic shipping costs from self distribution of exclusive content personnel costs music publishing on exclusive music related dvd and cd titles our financial focus is on achieving long term  sustainable growth and profitability 
we also seek to improve our cash flow position in order to continue licensing  or entering into exclusive distribution agreements for  high quality dvd and other entertainment content and funding operations 
competition when acquiring exclusive content distribution rights  we continue to face increasing competition from special market divisions of the major motion picture studios sony columbia tri star which recently purchased mgm disney dreamworks fox paramount universal warner mini majors lions gate miramax new line major music labels sony bmg capital emi universal warner music group independent music labels independent dvd and cd content suppliers for limited retail shelf space  we also continue to face increasing competition from major motion picture studios independent dvd and cd suppliers major and independent music labels who offer dvd content other home entertainment providers besides limited retail shelf space  we also face competition for retailer open to buy dollars  which are the purchasing budgets that retailers allocate to purchase new release or catalogue titles 
competition for content we face increasing competition from other independent distribution companies  major motion picture studios and music labels in securing exclusive content license and distribution rights 
as dvd player household penetration increases through increasing sales of stand alone dvd players and dvd based video game player systems and as retail shelf space for home video formats increases  more and more companies view dvd licensing and distribution as an attractive business 
many  including new line  lions gate  navarre corporation  and several of the major studios  are expanding or launching efforts in the dvd licensing market  sometimes in the form of direct to video motion pictures 
because the home video rights to most newly released and catalogue motion pictures are already owned by the major studios  the market for high profile dvd content to an independent supplier is limited 
moreover  the market for available high profile music related dvd content is also limited as major and independent record labels continue to increase the number of music related titles released on dvd through their own labels 
in light of the increase in demand and limitation in supply  obtaining quality dvd content at reasonable prices has become more challenging 
our internal analyses and forecasts  which are designed with the goal of timely advance recoupment  attempt to limit the upfront advances against future royalties or  for distribution agreements  production and net profit payments we are willing to pay to secure content rights 
accordingly  we may not be able to remain competitive against advance offers from competitors who may at times be willing to pay larger advances 
this challenge is compounded when competitors who lack broad expertise in the field of dvd licensing occasionally offer advances or other terms for content which we believe to be unrealistic based upon our own internal forecasts and historical experience in a particular genre 
although such unrealistic offers might have adverse effects on these competitors businesses in the medium and long term  the short term effect appears to be an artificial inflation in content valuations  which effectively decreases the availability of quality content 
additionally  as we see more and more opportunities for higher profile content  we are increasingly finding ourselves in competition with major motion picture studios  the mini majors and major music labels  who tend to have greater financial resources and the ability to offer higher advances by leveraging their market power including significant influence on retailer shelf space allotment with retailers in order to obtain larger quantities of product purchases 
we believe that we will continue to compete successfully in obtaining exclusive rights to home entertainment content 
this is due in large part to our ability to offer an array of other assets to our program suppliers  including the high quality of expertise and the service our employees provide our superior  long standing reputation within the home entertainment industry and our status as a public company which is particularly helpful when competing against private independents our status as an independent which allows freedom from the major labels  more creative control to the content creator  comparatively fewer obstacles in content creation  marketing and distribution  and comparatively simpler accounting for royalties and net profits to the supplier our notable ability to obtain and sustain ongoing relationships with valuable suppliers of entertainment programming the quality of our finished titles our specialized marketing expertise in areas such as comedy  urban  latin  music related  broadway and special interest titles our wide ranging in house services our direct and long standing relationships with mass merchants and traditional and online retailers of entertainment titles competition for retail shelf space our exclusive content competes for a finite amount of shelf space against a growing supply of entertainment content from other suppliers 
new dvd releases often exceed titles a week 
we believe this competition can be especially challenging for independent labels like us  because the new dvd releases of major studios often have extremely high visibility and sales velocity in the millions of units  which typically require more shelf space to support 
in light of the impact of major studio releases  our expenses with respect to providing market development funds and cooperative advertising dollars to our retail customers for items such as in store displays and store circulars continue to increase  even as the availability of these opportunities continues to decrease 
this selling of shelf real estate  whether real or virtual  is becoming more expensive as the total number of dvd releases continues to grow 
with the exception of our more popular new titles and top selling catalogue titles  it can be a challenge to obtain the product placement necessary to maximize sales  particularly among the limited number of major retailers that are our core customers 
retailers are increasingly looking for studios and independents to pay to secure display and shelf space within their stores 
even some successful internet retailers now require paid participation in these types of programs in order to ensure visibility and positioning on their web sites 
some of these programs can cost as much as of a retailer s total order  although we may also realize significant advertising and marketing benefits from such programs  especially if they grant competitive benefits over other studios and independents that are unable or unwilling to pay 
as competition in our industry continues to increase  we expect that more retailers will adopt these types of programs  which would result in decreased gross margins 
competition for retailer open to buy dollars we compete with other content suppliers for limited open to buy dollars allocated by retailers to purchase new release or catalogue dvd and cd titles 
open to buy dollars are becoming more scarce for independents like us  since such dollars are often devoted to high profile new releases from major studios  particularly during the holiday season 
reduced wholesale dvd pricing instituted by the major studios and labels  coupled with their ongoing catalogue campaigns and marketing muscle  has also increased competition for open to buy dollars 
most studios and labels are subsidiaries of much larger media conglomerates that have financial resources far greater than ours 
we believe that titles from an independent content supplier like us continue to be attractive to retailers because of the gross margins retained by the retailers from the sale of independent titles 
in contrast  there is a great deal of pricing competition among retailers for the new release theatrical blockbusters  as such major hits are often advertised as loss leaders to bring in retail traffic 
we do not sell new release major studio titles  and our titles are typically sold at a lower discount to the consumer by the retailer 
increasing competition as our industry matures  with dvd set top and dvd game player penetration of us television households having exceeded at the close of calendar  and new retail space being allocated for dvd programming  the competition level will continue to rise 
the major studios remain consistent and prolific in their ability to bring new theatrical titles to retailers 
they have large libraries of content to release on dvd 
new independent suppliers are continually emerging  further adding to the competition 
the additional promotional opportunities and open to buy dollars may be severely compromised by the new major theatrical programming  new independent suppliers and the vast catalogues of content controlled by the major studios 
industry trends according to adams media research hollywood aftermarket report dated february   dvd set top penetration of television households reached through december   excluding dvd game players  with million of million television households having at least one dvd player 
adams media expects this penetration to reach within the next years 
this represents an estimated annual compound growth rate in dvd set top player households 
additionally  adams media estimates that dvd game player households without a set top dvd player reached a penetration level of million  or of television households  through december  they expect this number to decline to million  or of television households  within the next years 
according to adams media hollywood aftermarket report dated january   consumer dvd sell through spending increased to billion in  from billion in consumer dvd sell through spending is expected to grow to billion through  a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
net supplier revenue from dvd sell through was billion in  up from billion in net supplier revenue from dvd sell through is expected to grow to billion through  a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
annual dvd disc buys per dvd set top household were discs in  at an average price of per disc  slightly higher than discs per household in  at a lower average price than s per disc 
vhs sell through consumer spending  on the other hand  continues to decline rapidly  down from billion in to billion in we believe the recent popularity of television content on dvd illustrates the consumer appetite for non feature dvd content 
non feature dvd content is our primary focus in light of our diverse array of general and specialty content 
adams media reports hollywood aftermarket report dated february  that the new release and catalogue feature market share is shrinking in favor of non feature video 
in  of total sell through video revenues were new release and catalogue features  with representing non feature categories 
in  were features while non features grew to  with the largest growth being in tv on dvd 
as evidenced by our selling patterns  mass merchants  warehouse style retailers  internet retailers and dvd distributors are growing their dvd revenues at the expense of traditional mall based and stand alone dvd only retailers 
the overall economic climate and the uncertainty surrounding some retailers efforts to reorganize or restructure their businesses may lead to an increased risk of customer bankruptcy within the dvd retail space as well as an increased percentage of product returns to us 
product returns as a percentage of sales have increased over the past three years  from in fiscal year  to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
in particular  dvd retailers who also specialize in cd sales are becoming increasingly vulnerable to mounting pressure from warehouse style and online discounters  who now routinely offer cds for sale  and from illegal downloading of music from the internet and other music piracy 
many cd retailers have tried to reduce the impact of these downward pressures by also selling dvds  video games and other merchandise 
nevertheless  reorganizations and restructurings  as well as a significant number of store closures among cd retailers  appear to support an industry trend toward consolidations and reductions within the retail space  including retail space dedicated to dvd 
our dvd and cd revenues from mass merchants and warehouse style retailers have increased 
the larger retailers typically return titles which do not meet their internal minimum sales velocities 
to save costs  other retailers with multiple retail locations return titles with low sales velocities in a particular store back to their vendors  like us  and reorder the same titles for sale in a different retail store 
to save the costs of returns processing at their own distribution centers  retailers generally require their vendors incur such costs 
this practice has contributed to our higher returns percentage in recent years 
we believe that the dvd and cd return rates experienced by major studios and record labels are substantially higher than our return rates  due to the sheer volume of big budget theatrical and audio new releases sold into retail 
the typical dvd buying consumer has largely shifted from a catalogue programming focused early adopter to a mass market buyer driven by high profile  big budget theatrical films 
both major studio and independent dvd suppliers now see that the primary drivers of revenues are new releases  which generate both retail and consumer interest and also help drive the sale of catalogue programming 
we have a diverse catalogue of content  and according to dvd release report revised  we are the second largest source for music on dvd  behind only the recently merged sony bmg library  with titles in active release  and the top source for special interest programming on dvd with titles in active release 
we typically add an average of new dvd titles per month  with content spanning over many genres  to our current catalogue of over  active dvd titles 
in addition  we typically add an average of five new cd titles per month  and our current active catalogue contains over audio titles 
sales of our catalogue titles are affected by the strength of our new releases  continued customer demand and the availability of retail shelf space and retailer open to buy dollars 
trademarks we have obtained federal registrations of the trademarks image  image entertainment  the image entertainment logo  and image music group  and have filed a federal trademark application for egami media 
it is our policy to protect and defend our trademark rights 
employees as of june   we had full time employees and four part time employees employed by us  two full time employees employed by egami media  and two full time employees employed by image uk 
nine of our employees  including all of our executive officers and senior vice presidents  are covered by employment agreements  with the remainder being at will employees 
risk factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this report  including the risk factors listed below 
if any of these risks occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed  the price of our common stock could decline  and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks relating to our business 
we have a high concentration of sales from relatively few titles 
our top five fiscal new release exclusive titles dvd larry the cable guy git r done  dvd ron white they call me tater salad  cd the source presents hip hop hits  dvd bill engvall here s your sign  and dvd jeff foxworthy you might be a redneck if check your neck accounted for approximately of our fiscal net revenues 
our top ten fiscal new release exclusive titles accounted for approximately of our fiscal net revenues 
although catalogue sales of these titles continue to be relatively strong  sales for these titles nevertheless have decreased over time and will probably continue to do so until our rights expire  such as with our former perennial best seller eagles hell freezes over worldwide net revenues from the sale of this eagles title during fiscal were  for which our sell off rights expire on june  net revenues from new release dvd titles  where a new release title is defined as released during fiscal  accounted for approximately of fiscal net dvd revenues and net revenues from catalogue dvd titles  where catalogue is defined as a title first released in a previous fiscal year  accounted for approximately of fiscal net dvd revenues 
revenues from new release and catalogue dvd titles accounted for approximately and of fiscal net dvd revenues  respectively 
if we cannot acquire titles of equal or greater strength and popularity  our future net revenues would be negatively impacted 
we have a high concentration of sales to relatively few customers 
anderson merchandisers who supplies wal mart  best buy and aec one stop group together accounted for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended march  additionally  our top five retail customers accounted for over of our fiscal net revenues 
any combination of these customers filing for bankruptcy or significantly reducing their purchases of our programming would have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our top retail customers accounted for approximately of our fiscal net revenues 
we are not an exclusive supplier to any of our retail customers  and there is no guarantee that we will continue recognizing significant revenue from sales to any particular customer 
if we are unable to maintain the sale of our titles at their current levels to any these five customers  and are unable to find other customers to replace these sales  there would be a negative impact on our revenues and future profitability 
we have extended more favorable payment terms to our customers  which increases our credit risk 
we created a fourth quarter catalogue sales program which included the offering of net  and day payment terms  rather than our customary net to days  on specific catalogue orders from retail customers who chose to participate in the program 
in addition  we offered discounts of three to five percent  a standard practice for us on particularly large catalogue sales orders  on these extended dating purchases 
our extended payment terms allowed some of our customers most notably aec one stop  critic s choice  ingram  musicland and trans world entertainment to expand the size and breadth of what they would have purchased otherwise 
nevertheless  the extended payment terms increase the risk of larger outstanding accounts receivable  which may become uncollectible or less collectible in the event any of these customers file for bankruptcy 
the catalogue sales program also increases the risk that participating customers will order fewer catalogue titles from us in upcoming quarters 
the risks inherent in our strategic alliances could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we have co production deals in place with dark horse entertainment and contentfilm  and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances with other third party content producers 
we will rely on our co producers to develop and produce films 
particularly when produced by independent filmmakers  each film is a separate business venture with its own management  employees  equipment and budgetary requirements 
there are substantial risks associated with film production  including contract problems with  or disability of  directors  actors and other key artistic and technical personnel  weather and other delays  damage to sets  equipment or film  and the inability of production personnel to comply with budgetary or scheduling requirements 
such problems could materially increase the cost of production  increase the amount of time between our expenditure of funds and receipt of revenues  or cause the project to be abandoned at any stage if further expenditures do not appear commercially feasible 
accordingly  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our strategic alliances  and any failure of our present and future alliances to produce commercially viable content at an acceptable cost could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  there is no assurance that we will be able to find further desirable strategic alliances as we continue pursuing new co production deals and similar relationships 
if our current dvd and cd genre concentrations become unpopular with our retail customers and end consumers  our business may be adversely affected 
during fiscal  our dvd title genre concentration was heavily weighted toward music related dvd programming 
we were successful in our fiscal efforts to diversify our exclusive content into multiple dvd genres and grow our revenues in the cd format 
approximately  and of our domestic net revenues generated in fiscal were derived from sales of exclusively produced acquired comedy  television and music related dvd entertainment content  respectively  with the remaining spread over multiple special interest genres 
this compares to an approximately concentration in music related dvd content in fiscal with the remainder spread among special interest genres 
during fiscal we were able to grow our audio business to over of our total net revenues  compared to approximately in fiscal  further diversifying the source of our revenues 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully to continually produce and or acquire content in the same genres  however  or that we will achieve the same strength within the genres with which we were successful in fiscal if we cannot compete successfully in the home entertainment market for higher profile dvd and cd content  our business may be adversely affected 
we may need additional funding to continue acquiring desirable programming 
availability of working capital is a substantial factor in our ability to produce and or acquire new content 
therefore  maximizing available working capital is critical to our business operations 
we may need to raise additional funds to acquire the rights to content or to create content we find desirable 
should additional funds be raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced 
if adequate funds are not available or unavailable on acceptable terms  we may find we are unable to fund expansion  continue offering products and services  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  and or respond to competitive pressures in the industry 
inventory obsolescence poses a risk to us 
we maintain a substantial investment in dvd and cd inventory  and if we overestimate the demand for a particular title  we may retain significant quantities of that title in our warehouse 
retained inventory occupies valuable storage space and may become obsolete as our distribution term for the title expires 
although we may sell such inventory at a steeply discounted price toward the end of the distribution term in order to recoup our manufacturing  storage and other costs  there is no guarantee that a market will exist for a given title  even at the steeply discounted price 
additionally  our license and or distribution agreements sometimes contain terms  such as minimum royalties per unit and music publishing fees  which effectively prevent us from steeply discounting the price on some titles 
we face risks associated with deluxe s performance under our manufacturing services agreement 
we source substantially all of our dvd replication from deluxe 
any failure of deluxe to manufacture and deliver our product in a timely manner and with the same consistent quantity and quality that we and our customers have come to expect may adversely affect our revenues and profits 
additionally  although we believe we have the ability to shift our product manufacturing from deluxe to another facility should the need arise  we may be adversely affected by the period of time that we would need to direct manufacturing duties to another company 
we face risks in distributing our programming internationally 
we distribute our programming internationally and derive a decreasing percentage of our revenues from sales activity outside of north america 
as a result  our business may be subject to various risks inherent in international trade  many of which are beyond our control 
risks faced in distributing our programming internationally include cancellation or renegotiation of contracts  changes in laws and policies affecting international trade including taxes  credit risk  fluctuating foreign exchange rates and controls  civil strife  acts of war  guerilla activities  insurrection  terrorism  changing retailer and consumer tastes and preferences with regard to our programming  differing degrees of protection of our intellectual property  cultural barriers  and potential instability of foreign economies and governments 
the majority of international revenues are generated by three sublicensees 
revenues generated from international distribution are primarily from the manufacturing  marketing and distribution efforts of sony bmg  warner music group and  in the future  digital site 
should any of sony bmg  warner or digital site default on their respective sublicense agreements with us or fail to successfully perform  an important part of our business strategy  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
we have direct and indirect foreign currency exchange risk 
although our sony bmg and digital site sublicense agreements are us dollar denominated  with these parties reporting to us and paying us in us dollars  the underlying sony bmg sales transactions are in euros and the underlying digital site sales transactions are in yen 
on june   the euro was equivalent to approximately us and the yen was equivalent to approximately us 
should the us dollar strengthen compared to either the euro or the yen  our sublicensors reported royalties to us on a title by title basis and in the aggregate would decline assuming consistent unit sales and thus reduce our revenues recognized 
we have an accumulated deficit and may incur additional losses 
while we were profitable for fiscal  we sustained net losses for the three preceding fiscal years ending march  our accumulated deficit at march   was million 
while we have made changes to our business that we hope will successfully lead to consistent profitability  due to the inherent unpredictability of high profile content acquisition and competition for limited retail shelf space  we may incur losses again in the future 
if we cannot maintain relationships with our program suppliers and vendors  our business may be adversely affected 
we receive a significant amount of our revenue from the distribution of those dvds for which we already have exclusive agreements with program suppliers 
we can give no assurances  however  that titles in production which have been financed by us will be timely delivered as agreed or of the expected quality 
delays or inadequacies in delivery  including rights clearances  could negatively impact the performance of any given quarter or fiscal year 
we can give no assurance that such content will ultimately be purchased in internally forecasted quantities by our retail customers or ultimately desired by the end consumer 
we also cannot be sure that we will be able to renew these exclusive rights as existing agreements with program suppliers expire 
we also cannot assure you that our current program suppliers will continue to support the dvd format in accordance with our exclusive agreements  that our current content suppliers will continue to license titles to us on the current terms or on terms favorable to us  or that we will be able to establish new beneficial supplier relationships to ensure acquisition of exclusive titles in a timely and efficient manner 
the full exploitation of our rights requires us to conduct business in areas where our expertise is limited 
in order to fully exploit some of the rights we have acquired  we are required to conduct business in sectors eg internet  rental  broadcast  video on demand  in flight  satellite where we are not as experienced as we are in the dvd and home video sectors 
accordingly  when exploiting such sectors in which we are less experienced  we may realize a greater proportion of costs  or we may not realize as much of a proportion of revenue  as we would in the dvd and home video sectors 
if we do not effectively implement our sales and marketing efforts  our profitability may suffer 
we have increased our internal sales staff in order to enhance our sales efforts 
we cannot assure you that our sales team can successfully compete against the more extensive and well funded sales operations of our current and future competitors  however 
if our key personnel leave us  our business may be adversely affected 
our success greatly depends on the performance of our executive management  including the president and chief executive officer  chief operating officer and chief financial officer  as well as our five senior vice presidents responsible for the critical areas of content acquisition  legal  marketing product development  operations  and sales 
the loss of the services of key persons of our executive and senior management could have an adverse material effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if we do not successfully optimize and operate our warehouse and distribution facility  our business could be harmed 
domestic wholesale distribution of our exclusive programming is fulfilled from a single warehouse and distribution facility in las vegas  nevada 
if we are unable to operate this facility for any reason  it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand 
because it is difficult to predict sales increases or declines  we may not manage our facility in an optimal way  which may result in excess inventory  warehousing and distribution problems 
our failure to handle inventory properly could result in unexpected costs  delays and harm to our business and reputation 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may adversely affect our business 
we maintain insurance to protect ourselves against various risks related to our operations 
this insurance is maintained in types and amounts that we believe to be reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
however  we may elect to limit coverage or not to carry insurance for some risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons 
for example  we do not carry earthquake insurance in light of the steep increase in premiums in southern california after the northridge earthquake on january  occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flows and overall profitability 
risks relating to our industry 
our success depends on the unpredictable commercial success of our programming 
operating in the entertainment industry involves a substantial degree of risk 
each music performance  feature film or other programming title is an individual artistic work  and unpredictable audience reactions primarily determine commercial success 
the commercial success of a title also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs or titles released into the marketplace  critical reviews  the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities  general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors  all of which are subject to change and cannot be predicted with certainty 
our success will depend in part on the popularity of our content which  in turn  depends on our ability to gauge and predict expected popularity 
even if a film achieves success during its theatrical release  the popularity of a particular program and its ratings may diminish over time  which may have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
timing and timeliness are also sometimes relevant to a program s success  especially when the program concerns a recent event or historically relevant material eg an anniversary of a historical event which focuses media attention on the event and accordingly spurs interest in related content 
decreasing retail shelf space may limit sales of our programming 
we face increasing competition from major motion picture studios  music labels and other independent distribution companies for limited retail shelf space and retailer open to buy dollars 
our exclusive content competes for a finite amount of shelf space against a growing supply of entertainment content 
because the new dvd releases of major studios often have extremely high visibility and sales velocity in the millions of units  which typically require more shelf space to support  we may not be able to afford or obtain the product placement necessary to maximize sales  particularly among the limited number of major retailers that are our core customers  which could result in decreased revenues and gross margins 
see competition above 
if we do not effectively implement a transition to vendor managed inventory  our business may be adversely affected 
larger retailers are starting to move toward a vendor managed inventory vmi system whereby independent suppliers like us would be responsible for monitoring  stocking and fulfilling directly to individual retail stores and outlets 
we currently have one major customer who is requiring vmi in the near future  and other customers are likely to follow suit 
the first target date for vmi compliance for music dvd and cd is august  and target dates for other categories of dvd are expected to be later in or while we currently expect to have a vmi system in place to test in late or early  with full implementation projected a few months thereafter  we may not be able to do so in a timely and effective manner 
also  the corresponding expense to upgrade our existing oracle system  add a vmi oracle module  plus associated training and consulting costs  are presently unknown 
failure to implement vmi in a timely manner could result in decreased opportunities for shelf space or decreased margins  and may require us to sell to vmi customers indirectly through third parties who have already implemented vmi 
while we should be able to add other customers without significant additional costs or time once we implement vmi  there can be no assurance this will be the case  and vmi implementation may require additional freight charges as inventory is sent directly to retail stores and outlets in smaller packages with greater frequency 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological advances 
the entertainment industry in general  and the music and motion picture industries in particular  are continuing to undergo significant changes  primarily due to technological developments 
as an independent supplier  we believe we have a superior ability to adapt to changing formats and distribution methods  as we did when shifting our focus from laserdiscs to dvds  and that our customer base will continue to purchase programming from us through new distribution methods 
however  because of the rapid growth of technology  shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment  it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on potential revenue from  and profitability of  distributing entertainment programming 
it is also impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on our ability to compete effectively in a changing market 
product returns pose a significant risk to us 
as with the major studios and other independent companies in this industry  we experience a relatively high level of product returns as a percentage of our revenues 
although our past experience indicates that our allowances for sales returns are adequate to cover potential returns  there can be no assurance that these reserves will be adequate in the future  in the case of consolidation within the home video retail marketplace which  when it occurs  tends to result in inventory consolidation and increased returns 
illegal piracy may reduce our revenues 
the music industry is facing a major challenge in the form of illegal piracy resulting from internet downloading and or cd recorders 
this piracy has negatively affected industry revenues and profits 
although we currently derive only of our revenues from audio cds  we expect that our proportional revenues in this sector will increase 
additionally  dvd recorders are gradually gaining greater market penetration 
according to in stat  the dvd recorder market  not including units connected to pcs  doubled in size in and is expected to grow in they expect worldwide dvd recorders to grow from million in to million in as dvd recorders and high speed internet connections become more popular  and the storage capacity of personal computers increases  we may face greater piracy concerns with respect to our core dvd business 
others failure to promote our programming may adversely affect our business 
decisions regarding the timing of release and promotional support of programming which we license and distribute are important in determining the success of a particular music concert  feature film or related product 
we may not control the manner in which a particular artist  film or related product is marketed and promoted  and we may not be able to fully control our corresponding dvd or cd release 
although artists  record companies  studios and producers have a financial interest in the success of any such concerts or films distributed by us  any marketing or promotional decision or restriction by such persons may negatively affect the success of our titles 
additionally  the availability of retailer programs relating to product placement  co op advertising and market development funds  and our ability and willingness to pay for such programs  are also important with respect to promoting our exclusive titles 
if dvd cannot compete successfully with other formats of home entertainment  our revenues may be negatively impacted 
the dvd format competes with other formats of in home entertainment  such as network  syndicated  cable and pay per view television and home satellite systems 
the dvd format also competes with new and emerging technologies in the entertainment industry  such as entertainment programming on the internet  video on demand  high definition television  digital videotape and optical discs with greater storage capacity 
while we are actively seeking to exploit these alternate home entertainment formats and emerging content delivery technologies  they nevertheless could negatively impact the overall market for our dvd sales  especially if we are unable to continue to adapt and exploit the development and advancement of such technology 
dvd sales may not sustain the same level of growth 
we believe that consumer interest in the dvd format is due partly to interest in building the consumer s personal dvd library of desired entertainment programming 
although our exclusive titles have generally shown stable sales over extended periods  as consumers build their dvd libraries  or with the introduction of new home entertainment formats  dvd sales may decline and adversely affect our operations 
see industry trends above 
decreasing retail prices for dvds may negatively impact our revenues 
the home entertainment programming market in which we compete is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
many of our competitors  including major studios  are increasingly offering programming  particularly dvd programming  at lower prices 
they may be able to produce or secure content on more favorable terms and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we are able to do 
while we strive to improve our operating efficiencies and leverage our fixed costs so that we can afford to pass along these savings to our customers in the form of lower prices  the industry trend of lowering prices may  over time  lead to higher levels of competition and  therefore  lost sales  decreased profit margins or decreased overall revenues 
conflicting high definition dvd formats may cause inefficiencies 
currently  two major platforms are competing to become the dominant high definition player  and recent talks to unify the platforms have been unsuccessful 
the hd dvd platform is purported to launch in late  while the blu ray disc platform is purported to launch in early mid for many of our titles  we hold rights to both platforms  but simultaneously supporting both platforms will cause increased production costs and decreased efficiencies with respect to inventory management and sales 
moreover  competing platforms may cause a delay in high definition player market penetration  and mainstream acceptance of high definition dvd in general  as consumers may decide to wait and see which platform prevails before purchasing a player 
our film production efforts may not be financially successful 
our co produced films are more expensive to create than our dvd co productions  and the time between our expenditure of funds and receipt of revenues is longer 
while much of our programming is sold to retailers on a sell through basis  the financial success of our filmed programming will depend on our ability to generate higher sales to retailers who primarily rent programming such as blockbuster  movie gallery  hollywood entertainment now a wholly owned subsidiary of movie gallery and netflix  as well as to mass merchants such as wal mart  costco and target 
our filmed programming may not ultimately be as desirable to our target customers as we would hope  which would lead to lower than expected sales  decreased profit margins or losses 
if we cannot continue to secure dvd license and distribution rights  our business may be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to secure dvd and other license and distribution rights on terms acceptable to us 
see competition above 
major motion picture studios have normally not granted  nor are they expected to grant  exclusive dvd licenses to us for new releases and popular catalogue titles 
instead  the major motion picture studios will most likely continue to sell dvd titles directly to retailers 
we expect to continue to license exclusive dvd and other home entertainment format content  but we cannot assure you that we can remain competitive against licensing entities with greater financial resources or that independent program suppliers will not distribute their programming themselves 
in addition  our success will continue to be dependent upon our ability to identify and secure rights to exclusive content that appeal to consumers 
we may not possess satisfactory rights in our properties 
although we require satisfactory chain of title information to our exclusively licensed content  the risk exists that some programs may have a defective chain of title 
the validity and ownership of rights to some titles can be uncertain and may be contested by third parties 
our results of operations fluctuate based on seasonality and variability 
we have generally experienced higher sales of dvds and cds in the quarters ended december and march due to increased consumer spending associated with the year end holidays 
accordingly  our revenues and results of operations may vary significantly from period to period  and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results of any future periods 
in addition to seasonality issues  other factors have contributed to variability in our dvd and cd net revenues on a quarterly basis 
these factors include the popularity of exclusive titles in release during the quarter  late delivery or non delivery of dvd or cd content or rights clearances by our content providers our marketing and promotional activities  our rights and distribution activities  the availability of retailer shelf space the level of retailer open to buy dollars  the extension  termination or non renewal of existing license and distribution rights  and general economic changes affecting the buying habits of our customers  particularly those changes affecting consumer demand for home entertainment hardware  packaged media and digital content protecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to compete in the home entertainment industry depends  in part  upon successful protection of our proprietary and intellectual property 
we protect our property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable international companies in specific territories and media for limited durations 
despite these precautions  existing copyright and trademark laws afford only limited practical protection in some jurisdictions 
in some jurisdictions of our distribution  there are no copyright and or trademark protections available 
as a result  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy and distribute our productions or portions or applications of our intended productions 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the resulting diversion of resources could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
from time to time  we may also receive claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
regardless of the validity or the success of the claims  we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against such claims  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to our stock 
our stock price may be subject to substantial volatility  and you may lose all or a substantial part of your investment 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market 
there is a limited public float even after our recent private placement  and trading volume historically has been limited and sporadic 
over the last year  the closing price of our common stock ranged between and per share on volume ranging from to over million shares per day 
as a result  the current price for our common stock is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our fair market value 
the price at which our common stock will trade may be highly volatile and may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including  without limitation  the number of shares available for sale in the market  quarterly variations in our operating results  and actual or anticipated announcements of new releases by us or competitors  the gain or loss of significant customers  changes in the estimates of our operating performance  market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole 
the resale of our private placement shares may significantly impact the market price of our common stock 
in december  we sold  shares of our common stock in a private placement 
the effective registration and resale of shares by the purchasers in the placement may significantly affect the market price of our stock 
we have  shares of common stock outstanding as of june  the shares sold in the offering represent approximately of our currently outstanding shares 
assuming all of the warrants we issued in connection with the placement were exercised for cash of  we would have  outstanding shares of common stock  and the  shares in the offering would represent of our outstanding shares 
because the shares were registered on behalf of the selling shareholders  we have no control over which of them will actually resell all or any portion of their shares  or at what price 
we may incur increased costs as a result of laws and regulations relating to corporate governance matters 
laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted or proposed by the securities and exchange commission and by nasdaq  will result in increased costs to us as we evaluate the implications of any new rules and respond to their requirements 
if our public float exceeds million at the end of our second fiscal quarter on september   we will become an accelerated filer and be subject to additional regulatory requirements  including section of sarbanes oxley which would the require us to include in our annual report for the period ending march  a report by management on our internal control over financial reporting and an accompanying auditor s report 
the additional costs and efforts to do so could be substantial 
if we remain a non accelerated filer  we will not have to comply until march  new rules could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 
we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with any new rules and regulations 
any future sales of equity may significantly impact the market price of our common stock 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares that we may issue upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
further  if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and the price of our common stock may fall

overview sources of revenue our primary source of revenues continues to be derived from the acquisition and distribution of exclusive dvd content in north america  which accounted for over of our overall net sales in fiscal a growing source of revenues in fiscal is derived from the distribution of cd content in north america  which accounted for over of our fiscal net revenues 
internationally  we primarily receive royalty income from sublicenses with sony bmg  warner music and digital site for the distribution of our exclusive dvd content 
cost structure our most significant costs and cash expenditures relate to acquiring content for exclusive distribution and  more recently  the funding of content production or co production for exclusive distribution 
with the popularity of dvd growing  the cost of acquiring content for exclusive distribution is also growing 
additionally  the cost of product placement  co op advertising and market development funds provided to our retail customers continues to increase 
competition we continue to face increasing competition from major motion picture studios  music labels and other independent distribution companies to acquire exclusive content distribution rights for limited retail shelf space for retailer open to buy dollars home video rights to most motion pictures are owned by major studios and distributed directly to the large retail customers 
record labels continue to increase their music related titles released through their own labels  and other independent content suppliers are aggressively competing for non major studio content 
obtaining quality dvd programming at reasonable prices based upon internally forecasted sales is becoming more challenging 
our exclusive content competes for a finite amount of shelf space  against a growing supply of entertainment content 
available open to buy dollars allocated by retailers to purchase dvd and cd titles are becoming more scarce  since the majority of dollars are often devoted to high profile new releases from major studios and major music labels 
we believe our expenses to provide market development funds and cooperative advertising dollars to our retail customers will continue to increase  and availability of opportunities will continue to be title dependent 
internet retailers do offer virtual shelf space by virtue of being able to show far more titles through the internet to the consumer than physical space allows and are a growing source of revenues for us 
content acquisition strategy our content acquisition strategy has expanded to include genres such as comedy television feature films urban youth culture lifestyle latin we intend to maintain our focus on genres that have been successful in the past  as well as to seek out early trend opportunities in advance of mainstream acceptance in an effort to keep acquisition costs lower by bringing titles to market before spikes in demand  especially in growing genres such as urban and latin 
we also have a successful track record of releasing classic television content on dvd  with our success on titles such as the original the twilight zone  the richard pryor show  and the dick van dyke show resulting in new opportunities to release popular television shows such as cult favorite pee wee s playhouse  combat  saved by the bell the college years and the new class and the twilight zone the s 
we have also become a leader in comedy content on dvd after releasing successful comedy programs from recent oscar winner jamie foxx  blue collar comedians larry the cable guy  ron white  bill engvall and jeff foxworthy three of the four were produced by us  the howard stern show s artie lange  and several branded comedy series including jamie foxx s laffapalooza 
our success with comedy titles helped us recently acquire the rights to distribute just for laughs  an internationally known canadian brand with a deep and diverse library of gag and stand up comedy content 
our music related dvd business continues to expand in an increasingly competitive market  with popular fiscal releases such as ramones raw  the music documentary about the recording of the classic charity song we are the world  vans warped tour  and doors of the st century la woman live 
fiscal dvd releases will include the taste of chaos concert tour  hall and oates live featuring renditions of soul classics  yes live  classic r b group mint condition live  chicago and earth wind fire live at the greek  and rockin the corps an american thank you a salute to our armed forces featuring live performances from destiny s child  kiss  ted nugent  godsmack  richie sambora and hootie the blowfish 
other new initiatives include the development of multicultural niches including latin hispanic product such as bienvenidos titles  latinologues  la lucha  and ciudad del sol sun city 
we are also continuing to expand our sales of audio cd programming with titles such as the source magazine s branded compilation series hip hop hits volumes and  mint condition livin the luxury brown  soundtracks for television shows cursed and summerland  the roots present  the live at billy bob s texas country music series  and other audio soundtrack companions to our video releases 
fiscal new releases will include the source presents hip hop hits volumes and  the source magazine s five mics formerly known as th anniversary of hip hop and the cd of rockin the corps featuring all groups on the dvd except destiny s child 
we are looking for attractive opportunities to acquire smaller independent content providers  their desirable titles  output distribution agreements or other assets  in order expand our catalogue of exclusive programming and grow revenues and earnings 
sales and marketing initiatives in order to deal with increasing competition more effectively  we continue to develop new marketing initiatives  including revenue growth related incentives to encourage retailers to carry our titles 
we have recently expanded our catalogue sales force to grow sales of titles which have been in distribution for over a year 
we also continue to adjust our price points on new release programming and selectively reprice and reposition our secondary and tertiary catalogue programming to drive revenues 
for example  while retailers are sometimes hesitant to bring in new individual titles  they have typically been more receptive to newly designed box sets 
these compilations have a higher perceived value among retailers and consumers  making both shelf space and retail sales easier to obtain 
repackaging existing product in this manner also typically creates higher margins 
accordingly  we have created and released additional box sets to better exploit our existing catalogue  such as the twilight zone  dick van dyke  pee wee s playhouse  the endless summer collection  box sets for eames and phenomenon  and collections for mission mars  mad monster and ed wood 
we recently released a cd dvd combination of our hit roy orbison black and white night 
we plan to release future box sets including the combat tv series and the urban music documentary series beef 
additionally  the favorable impact upon our cash flow of the closing of our million private placement allowed us the ability to create a fourth quarter catalogue sales program which included the offering of net  and day payment terms  rather than our customary net to days  on specific catalogue orders from retail customers who chose to participate in the program  a concession that some of our customers had been requesting for some time 
in addition  we offered discounts of three to five percent  a standard practice for us on particularly large catalogue sales orders  on these extended dating purchases 
we will continue seeking high quality programming to market and distribute in many genres

in october  we received a recoupable but non refundable million royalty advance in connection with a new japan sublicense agreement 
we used the proceeds of the private placement and the royalty advance to repay our then outstanding borrowing under our revolving line of credit and term loan facilities with wells fargo foothill 
private placement on december   we sold  shares of our common stock at per share for gross proceeds of million  in a private placement 
we also issued three year warrants to the investors to purchase up to  shares at per share 
the warrants may be exercised for cash beginning june  expenses of the private placement totaled  which included the cash fee paid to our exclusive placement agent and legal  accounting and other related expenses 
we also issued the placement agent a three year warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock on the same terms as the investors  except this warrant includes a cashless exercise provision 
the private placement allowed us to pay down our outstanding loan balances  strengthens our ability to acquire and produce exclusive content  and allows us to offer extended dating in certain circumstances as part of periodic sales programs 
japan sublicense agreement and million advance on october   we entered into an exclusive five year home video output sublicense agreement with digital site corporation for exclusive distribution of our programming in japan 
we previously distributed our programming in japan through sublicense agreements with various third parties on a title by title basis 
some of these sublicense agreements for certain titles remain in force 
digital site is responsible for sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution in japan 
the agreement includes our available existing catalogue as well as previously sublicensed titles as they become available and future new releases through the end of the distribution term for each program is five years or the expiration date of our rights 
programming is marketed and released under the brand  image entertainment japan 
the first releases under the agreement occurred in january royalty payments are set at a percentage of suggested retail price  and any overages will be paid after recoupment of the million non refundable advance received in october the advance was recorded as a component of deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue when royalties are earned  as reported to us on a quarterly basis 
at march   approximately million of the million advance is classified as a component of deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet 
advance from bmg now sony bmg received in fiscal and subsequent advances and recoupment we received a million initial royalty advance under the sony bmg agreement in march  fully recoupable from revenues generated by sony bmg against quarterly royalties due to us under the agreement 
based upon actual quarterly sales of our programming in the territories  sony bmg recoups quarterly royalties from the million previously advanced 
sony bmg provides additional quarterly royalty advances such that for the first three years of the agreement term through december   the outstanding royalty advance to us at any given time will be a constant million 
during the first three quarters of the fourth year of the term the nine months ending september   sony bmg will reduce  through recoupment  the outstanding royalty advance to million 
once the entire royalty advance is recouped  sony bmg will continue to pay quarterly royalties based on revenues generated 
during the fourth quarter of the fourth year the quarter ending december   sony bmg may recoup the entire remaining balance of million by not re advancing royalties quarterly 
the agreement contains a formula to pay an additional lesser advance at the beginning of the fifth and final year of the term calendar which is to be recouped by sony bmg during that year 
we must repay any outstanding unrecouped royalty advance within days following the final sony bmg reporting at the conclusion of sony bmg s sell off period after expiration of the five year term 
revolving credit and term loan facility on september   we amended our credit facility with wells fargo foothill 
the maximum revolving credit availability under the agreement was increased million  from million to million 
actual borrowing availability under the line remains substantially based upon eligible trade accounts receivable levels 
while the interest rate remains at the prevailing prime rate plus at march   the interest rate floor was reduced from to 
the option to borrow at libor plus was also added 
the maximum capital expenditures limit covenant was increased for fiscal to million plus  unused from fiscal  from million plus the same  the capital expenditures covenant maximum was lowered to million in fiscal  plus any unused carryover from fiscal the term of the agreement was extended two years through december  at march   we had cash of  and borrowing availability of million and million  respectively  under our revolving credit and term loan facilities with foothill 
comparatively  at march   we had cash of  and borrowing availability of  and  respectively  under our revolving credit and term loan facilities 
other sources and uses of working capital for fiscal our pretax net earnings from continuing operations were  for fiscal net revenues for the last two quarters of fiscal grew approximately from the last two quarters of fiscal  contributing to an increase in trade accounts receivable gross of reserves for sales returns  allowances and doubtful accounts to million at march   as compared to million at march  in anticipation of forecasted retail customer demand for our new release and catalogue titles  we increased our inventory levels  excluding production costs  to million at march   from million at march  we incurred million in capital expenditures during fiscal  far higher than our normal annual expenditures 
we spent approximately million to improve our information technology infrastructure and business systems 
we completed the conversion from our legacy qantel sales order management and production creative services systems to oracle  and invested funds to automate elements of our returns processing in our las vegas distribution facility 
coordinated investments in hardware  software and consulting services are being applied with the goal of reducing labor costs  increasing customer service and streamlining operating procedures related to returns processing 
we spent approximately million for furniture and fixtures covering additional work space systems and construction of our new in house production department and information technology facilities in connection with our new corporate headquarters 
although we will continue to upgrade production  creative services and distribution technology  we intend to spend far less on capital expenditures in fiscal  compared to fiscal we paid down long term debt and capital lease obligations by million during fiscal as a result of our net revenue growth  our trade accounts payable and accrued royalties  distribution fees and music publishing fees grew by million at march   compared to levels at march  we financed these expenditures from cash flows from operations and through our revolving line of credit 
primarily as a result of our net million private placement funding and the million royalty advance from our japanese sublicensor  there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving and term loan facility at march   compared to million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility at march  we believe that projected cash flows from operations  borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit  cash on hand  and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next months 
should we find attractive corporate acquisitions  we may seek additional debt or equity financing in order to fund the transaction  in the form of bank financing  convertible debt  or the issuance of convertible preferred or common stock 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations licensing and exclusive distribution agreements employment agreements total advances and guarantees included in the table above  under licensing and exclusive distribution agreements  are recoupable against future royalties and distribution fees earned by our exclusive program suppliers in connection with revenues generated by those rights 
as we have historically  we expect to fund these commitments through recoupment of existing advances  our existing bank line of credit  and other working capital 
we do not expect our obligations for property and equipment expenditures  including information technology related expenditures  to exceed million per year 
lease guarantee in connection with the asset sale of dvdplanet  planet entertainment assumed the obligations under dvdplanet s leases for its retail store and various other liabilities related to the assets being acquired and its parent infinity resources guaranteed planet entertainment s obligations 
we remain a guarantor in the event that planet entertainment and infinity default on their financial obligations under the lease 
the remaining payments under the lease total approximately  through december corporate headquarters our headquarters are located in chatsworth  california and consists of approximately  square feet on one floor of a multi tenant building 
the monthly rent is per square foot  on a gross basis  or approximately  per month  and increases approximately annually 
the office lease has an initial year term with two five year options 
the lease started on july   upon completion of approximately million in tenant improvements 
substantially all of the tenant improvement expenses were borne by the landlord 
we are expensing the total rent commitment  including the scheduled rent increases  on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
although a base level of operating expenses is included in the rent payment  we will be responsible for a percentage of actual annual operating expense increases capped at annually 
long term debt long term debt at march  and march   consisted of the following in thousands march  march  subordinated note payable ritek taiwan note payable to bank current portion of long term debt long term debt less current portion debt instruments and related covenants our loan agreements with wells fargo foothill require us to comply with minimum financial and operating covenants 
at september   we amended our capital expenditures covenant for fiscal the maximum capital expenditures limit covenant was increased for fiscal to million plus  unused from fiscal  from million plus the same  the capital expenditures covenant maximum was lowered to million in fiscal  plus any unused carryover from fiscal throughout the year ended march   we were in compliance with the financial and operating covenants under the loan agreement  and we believe that we will be able to achieve the minimum covenant requirements for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that involve significant uncertainties  require judgments or estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  or that may produce materially different results when using different assumptions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon meeting the recognition requirements of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from home video distribution  net of an allowance for estimated returns  as well as related costs  in the period in which the product is available for sale by our customers at the point that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  which is generally upon receipt by the customer  and in the case of new releases  after street date restrictions lapse 
we recognize revenues from domestic and international broadcast licensing and home video sublicensing  as well as associated costs  when the titles are available to the licensee and other recognition requirements of sop are met 
we defer fees received in advance of availability  usually in the case of advances received from sony bmg  digital site  warner music group and other international sublicensees  and for broadcast  until other revenue recognition requirements have been satisfied 
provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable are provided at the time of sale 
as of march   deferred revenue totaled  up from  primarily as a result of deferring the digital site royalty advance received 
royalty and distribution fees for each reporting period  we estimate the ultimate total revenues to be received throughout a title s exclusive license or distribution period from exploitation of that title in multiple home entertainment formats 
while we charge royalty and distribution fee advances to operations as related revenues are earned  estimates of ultimate revenues are important in determining whether we should record additional royalty and distribution fee expense as cost of sales in any given reporting period 
we amortize royalty and distribution fee advances to expense in the same ratio that the current period revenues for a title or group of titles bear to the estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenues for that title 
additionally  in circumstances required by sop  we recognize additional amortization to the extent that capitalized advance royalty and distribution fees exceed their estimated fair value in the period when estimated 
we base our estimates of ultimate revenue for each title on the historical performance of that title  similar titles and specific genre performance 
we attempt to reflect in our estimates the most current available information on the title 
we update such estimates based upon the actual results of each format s revenue performance 
estimates of ultimate revenues on a title by title basis are subject to substantial uncertainty 
factors affecting future actual performance include focus from the sales and marketing department including advertising  promotions and price reductions  availability of retail shelf space  retail customer product placement and advertising  maintenance of adequate inventory levels  concert touring by the artist  in the case of music related dvds and cds  retail sell through  and ultimately continued end user consumer demand 
any above the above factors can contribute to a title s actual performance exceeding our expectations prior to release or failure to meet pre release expectations 
overestimation of ultimate revenues would cause unamortized costs to be amortized at a slower rate or a delay in adjusting costs to their fair value until such time estimates are reduced  causing unamortized costs to be overstated and increased amortization of costs in a later period 
underestimation of ultimate revenues would cause unamortized costs to be amortized more quickly until ultimate revenue estimates are increased  causing unamortized costs to be understated and decreased amortization of costs in a later period 
inventory valuation for each reporting period  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by title  format and genre  and projections of future demand 
in addition  we write down inventories that are considered obsolete or overstocked 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost or market value  and result in a new basis in such inventory until sold 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
future demand will be dependent upon the continued retail customer acceptance of our content  future demand by end user consumer  advertising  promotions and price reductions  market conditions either favorable or unfavorable and future warehouse storage limitations 
should projections of future inventory demand be overstated  the value of inventory would be overstated and current cost of sales understated  with future cost of sales overstated 
conversely  should projections of future demand be understated  the value of inventory would be understated and the current cost of sales overstated  with future cost of sales understated 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts receivable for each reporting period  we evaluate product sales and accounts receivable to estimate their effect on revenues due to product returns  sales allowances and other credits given and delinquent accounts 
our estimates of product sales that will be returned and the amount of receivables that will ultimately be collected require the exercise of judgment and affect reported revenues and net earnings 
in determining the estimate of product sales that will be returned  we analyze historical returns quantity of returns and time to receive returned product  historical pricing and other credit memo data  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products  including reorder activity 
based on this information  we reserve a percentage of each dollar of product sales where the customer has the right to return such product and receive either a pricing or credit memo 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
estimates of future sales returns and other credits are subject to substantial uncertainty 
factors affecting actual returns include retailer financial difficulties  the perception of comparatively poor retail performance in one or several retailer locations  limited retail shelf space at various times of the year  inadequate advertising or promotions  retail prices being too high for the perceived quality of the content or other comparable content  the near term release of similar titles  and poor responses to package designs 
underestimation of product sales returns and other credits would result in an overstatement of current revenues and lower revenues in future periods 
conversely  overestimation of product sales returns would result in an understatement of current revenues and higher revenues in future periods 
similarly  we evaluate accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due 
based on this information  we reserve an amount that we believe to be doubtful of collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future 
underestimation of this allowance would cause accounts receivable to be overstated and current period expenses to be understated 
overestimation of this allowance would cause accounts receivable to be understated and current period expenses to be overstated 
valuation of deferred income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the establishment  or increase  of a valuation allowance increases income tax expense for such year 
establishment of valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets 
during our third quarter ended december   we established a valuation allowance against of our net deferred tax assets  which are composed primarily of net operating loss nol carry forwards  resulting in the recording of an income tax expense equal to the net deferred tax assets as of march  the valuation allowance was recorded in the third quarter primarily as a result of operating losses sustained during our normally seasonally strong third quarter as well as its then expected impact on the full fiscal year results of operations 
income tax expense relating to our establishment of a valuation allowance totaled  for the year ended march  even though we have fully reserved these net deferred tax assets for book purposes  we would still be able to utilize them to reduce future income taxes payable  should we have future earnings 
to the extent such deferred tax assets relate to nol carry forwards  the ability to use such nols against future earnings will be subject to applicable carry forward periods 
as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of  and  respectively  which are available to offset taxable income through and  respectively 
although we had pretax earnings of  for fiscal  we have not had a strong earnings history 
we enjoyed the benefits of a strong schedule of new dvd and cd releases during fiscal in light of the extremely strong retail success of a relatively few individual titles  we cannot provide assurances that our fiscal dvd and cd new releases will perform as well as  or better than  our fiscal releases 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at march   due to the following factors we had a pretax loss for fiscal  we had an accumulated deficit at march   and a significant portion approximately of our fiscal revenues  and by extension  fiscal profitability  was generated by only five titles 
results of operations net revenues approximately of consolidated net revenues were generated from our worldwide sale of dvds during fiscal  compared to in fiscal and cds contributed approximately of consolidated net revenues for fiscal  compared to and of fiscal and  respectively 
the following table presents consolidated net revenues by reportable business segment for the years ended march   and  respectively change change in thousands in thousands net revenues domestic international consolidated fiscal compared to and domestic revenue net revenues were significantly higher in fiscal  as compared to fiscal and fiscal  primarily because of strong revenue performance from our new exclusive dvd and cd releases 
we also had comparatively stronger sales of previously released dvd and cd catalogue titles  driving overall net revenues higher 
our top ten new release dvd and cd titles contributed approximately of our fiscal domestic net revenues compared to only approximately for fiscal we produced live stand up comedy concerts from blue collar comedians larry the cable guy  ron white and bill engvall  and we released a combined two titles in one dvd from a fourth blue collar comedian  jeff foxworthy 
net revenues from these four titles constituted approximately of our consolidated net revenues for the year 
also included in the top ten were the source presents hip hop hits volumes and cds  pee wee s playhouse seasons and  the twilight zone definitive edition season  and combat season campaign our cd net revenues have increased steadily over the past three fiscal years based primarily on the success of our source and live at billy bob s lines 
cd net revenues were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our december exclusive license agreement for the distribution of our former perennial best selling music dvd catalogue title eagles hell freezes over is in its nonexclusive sell off period  which expires on june  the distribution term for this agreement had been renewed several times in the past  but we were unable to renew it this time and the rights reverted back to the licensor 
our domestic net revenues from the sale of the eagles during fiscal were  in fiscal  we also experienced significantly increased sales to large retailers  particularly wal mart  amazon 
com and target  who purchased more titles in greater quantities than in fiscal and the increase was primarily because of our strong new release schedule  as well as our more specifically targeted and personalized sales efforts 
if we continue acquiring the type of programming that we have identified as being attractive to these retailers  we believe increased sales to them will continue 
as our sales to larger retailers increase  however  so does our relative dependence on them 
if any of our larger customers were to reduce purchases of our programming or file for bankruptcy  it could significantly decrease our revenues and negatively impact our earnings 
the favorable impact upon our cash flow of the closing of our million private placement allowed us the ability to create a fourth quarter catalogue sales program which included the offering of net  and day payment terms  rather than our customary net to days  on specific catalogue orders from retail customers who chose to participate in the program  a concession that some of our customers had been requesting for some time 
in addition  we offered discounts of three to five percent  a standard practice for us on particularly large catalogue sales orders  on these extended dating purchases 
our extended payment terms allowed some of our customers most notably aec one stop group  critic s choice  ingram  musicland group and trans world entertainment to expand the size and breadth of what they would have purchased otherwise 
this particular catalogue sales program generated revenues of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we are unable to provide assurances that this program  or programs similar to it  will not have a detrimental impact on the amount of catalogue purchases such customers will make in upcoming quarters 
our inventory returns  as a percentage of our gross distribution as opposed to net revenues  were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively 
we are selling more programming to larger retailers  who tend to return a higher percentage of their purchases  both to us and to the major studios 
many of these retailers have chosen not to process their own store returns at their own distribution center level  but instead return them to their vendors  including us  for credit 
a retailer may return a title from one store while ordering the same title for another store 
additionally  some retailers have returned more programming than their historical levels over the last year due to a financial restructuring in one case and a customer s move to a different warehouse and distribution center in the other case 
we have increased our allowances for sales returns in expectation of this trend continuing for the foreseeable future 
we have also provided increased market development funds to our customers for which are taken as a credit against revenues and are recorded by us as a reduction in revenues 
these market development fund expenditures totaled   and  or  and of net revenues  before reduction for such market development funds  for fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenue the decrease in the fiscal international revenues over that of fiscal was primarily due to lower royalty revenues reported by our international sublicensees 
a significant contributing factor was a lack of internationally desirable new dvd releases during the last half of fiscal because of language barriers and cultural differences  much of our recent successful new release programming particularly urban and comedy titles has not been released internationally or has not sold as well as in north america 
additionally  we believe internal restructuring at sony bmg associated with the merger had a negative impact on the sales performance of our titles in europe  the middle east and africa during the last half of fiscal we continue our efforts to acquire programming that sells well not only domestically  but also internationally 
music related dvds have done well internationally and we believe the urban music and documentary genres have revenue growth potential overseas 
our international revenues for fiscal will be negatively affected by the loss of our perennial best selling international title eagles hell freezes over as of june  as well as a lack of significant new international dvd releases 
our international net revenues from the sale of our eagles titles during fiscal were  or of international net revenues 
the opening of our uk office  however  may help us acquire new titles which perform better in international distribution 
broadcast sales decreased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal we continue to place less of an emphasis on acquiring broadcast rights for music programming  due to the high cost of music clearance in relation to the fees broadcasters are willing to pay to air the programming 
cost of sales the following table presents consolidated cost of sales by reportable business segment and as a percentage of related segment net revenues for the years ended march   and  respectively in thousands in thousands cost of sales domestic international consolidated change change as a percentage of segment net revenues domestic international consolidated we are now classifying production cost amortization as a component of cost of sales and therefore a reduction to gross profit margins for all periods presented 
we previously amortized production costs as a separate line item within operating costs and expenses 
because we disclose programming production costs as a component of inventory  we believe classification of the related expense of such costs as a component of cost of sales is more meaningful 
amortization of domestic and international production costs  as a percentage of net revenues  for the three years ended march   were  and  respectively 
the decline in production cost amortization as a percentage of net revenues is primarily due to significantly increased domestic revenues in fiscal consolidated cost of sales for fiscal  were  or of net revenues  compared to  or for fiscal and for fiscal consolidated gross margins for fiscal were  or of net revenues  compared to for fiscal and for fiscal for comparative purposes  exclusive of the fiscal non recurring credit of  to cost of sales related to the discontinuation of our distribution of dvds internationally through subdistributors  consolidated gross profit margin would have been  or higher by than fiscal fiscal compared to and domestic gross margins domestic gross margins  as a percentage of segment net revenues  increased by to for fiscal  from for fiscal and from for fiscal the increase in segment gross profit margins for fiscal was primarily due to increased net revenues from sales of exclusively licensed programming  which typically generates higher gross margins than exclusively distributed programming 
offsetting the increase in domestic gross margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal were increases in market development funds offered to our retail customers of  market development funds are recorded as a reduction in net revenues 
we expect the trend of increasing market development funds paid to customers to continue for the foreseeable future 
the decrease in segment gross profit margins for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increased charges to segment cost of sales from comparably increased amortization of royalty advances and adjustments to fair value as a result of lower ultimate revenue forecasts for some of our exclusive programming 
additionally  the comparatively increased market development funds we provide to our retail customers  and comparatively higher write downs of some inventory titles to the lower of cost or market value  also contributed to the decrease in segment gross margins in fiscal compared to international gross margins international gross margins  as a percentage of segment net revenues  increased by to for fiscal  from for fiscal and for fiscal exclusive of the aforementioned credit to cost of sales related to international subdistribution of our dvds  gross margins for the segment increased by to for fiscal from for fiscal gross margins for this segment in fiscal and were positively impacted primarily by fluctuations in royalties and distribution fees due to our program suppliers on a title by title basis  with revenues consisting almost entirely of royalty sublicense income 
for fiscal  gross margins were not only generated from sublicense royalty income and broadcast revenues  but also from subdistribution revenues 
gross margins were impacted by both fluctuations in royalties and distribution fees due to our program suppliers and by overall expenses  including manufacturing costs  music publishing fees and market development funds provided to subdistributors for marketing

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance

such cumulative losses from prior years must be considered on a pretax consolidated basis from all operations

to the extent such deferred tax assets relate to nol carry forwards  the ability to use such nols against future earnings will be subject to applicable carry forward periods

r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statement nos 
and sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments  focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
in april  the sec deferred the effective date of sfas r so that companies may now adopt its provisions at the beginning of their first annual period beginning after june  which would be fiscal  beginning april   for us 
we are evaluating the impact of sfas no 
r and expect that we will record non cash compensation expenses 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial condition or cash flows  but is expected to have a negative effect on the reporting of our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  for the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp fas clarifies that the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the date of enactment 
the impact of the deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed 
we do not believe that this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations 
at march   we had no outstanding borrowings subject to variable interest rates 
we do not use derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
our interest rate exposure is linked to the prime rate and libor 
we believe that moderate changes in the prime rate or libor would not materially affect our operating results or financial condition 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
at march   approximately  of our accounts receivable related to international distribution and were denominated in foreign currencies subject to future foreign exchange rate risk 
we distribute some of our licensed dvd and vhs programming internationally through subdistributors and sublicensees 
additionally  we exploit international broadcast rights to our licensed entertainment programming 
we believe that moderate changes in the foreign exchange rates for those agreements denominated in foreign currencies will not materially affect our operation results or financial condition 
for example  a change in exchange rates would result in an approximate  impact on pretax income loss based upon those outstanding receivables at march  although our sony bmg and digital site sublicense agreements are us dollar denominated  with these parties reporting to us and paying us in us dollars  the underlying sony bmg sales transactions are in euros and the underlying digital site sales transactions are in yen 
should the us dollar strengthen compared to either the euro or the yen  our sublicensees reported royalties to us on a title by title basis and in the aggregate would decline  assuming consistent unit sales  and thus reduce our revenues recognized 
to date  we have not entered into foreign currency exchange contracts
