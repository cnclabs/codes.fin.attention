item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation section should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our condensed consolidated financial statements and results appearing elsewhere in this report 
throughout this section  we make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of you can often identify these and other forward looking statements by terms such as becoming  may  will  should  predicts  potential  continue  anticipates  believes  estimates  seeks  expects  plans  intends  or comparable terminology 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  our expectations about revenue and various operating expenses 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  and we have based these expectations on our beliefs and assumptions  such expectations may prove to be incorrect 
our actual results of operations and financial performance could differ significantly from those expressed in or implied by our forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to competition in the eda market  magma s ability to integrate acquired businesses and technologies  potentially higher than anticipated costs of litigation  potentially higher than anticipated costs of compliance with regulatory requirements  including those relating to internal control over financial reporting  any delay of customer orders or failure of customers to renew licenses  weaker than anticipated sales of magma s products and services  weakness in the semiconductor or electronic systems industries  the ability to manage expanding operations  the ability to attract and retain the key management and technical personnel needed to operate magma successfully  the ability to continue to deliver competitive products to customers  and changes in accounting rules 
executive summary magma design automation provides electronic design automation eda software products and related services 
our software enables chip designers to reduce the time it takes to design and produce complex integrated circuits used in the communications  computing  consumer electronics  networking and semiconductor industries 
our products are used in all major phases of the chip development cycle  from initial design through physical implementation 
our focus is on software used to design the most technologically advanced integrated circuits  specifically those with minimum feature sizes of micron and smaller 
see item  business for a more complete description of our business 
as an eda software provider  we generate substantially all our revenue from the semiconductor and electronics industries 
our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services out of their research and development budgets 
as a result  our revenue is heavily influenced by our customers long term business outlook and willingness to invest in new chip designs 
beginning in late calendar  the semiconductor industry entered its steepest and longest downturn of the past years  with industry sales dropping significantly from late to early as a result  our customers have focused on controlling costs and reducing risk  lowering research and development r d expenditures  
table of contents cutting back on design starts  purchasing from fewer suppliers  requiring more favorable pricing and payment terms from suppliers  and pursuing consolidation within their own industry 
further  during this downturn  many start up semiconductor design companies failed or were acquired  and the pace of investment in new companies declined 
while the semiconductor industry experienced a moderate recovery in  our customers have remained cautious 
it is not yet clear when improved demand in our own customers electronics end markets will result in significantly increased r d spending or design starts  and corresponding spending on eda tools 
to support our customers  we have focused on providing the most technologically advanced products to address each step in the integrated circuit ic design process  as well as integrating these products into broad platforms  and expanding our product offerings 
our goal is to be the eda technology supplier of choice for our customers as they pursue longer term  broader and more flexible relationships with fewer suppliers 
despite the condition of the semiconductor industry described above  we were able to achieve the following during fiscal we continued to penetrate our market  and during the fourth quarter of fiscal we passed the customer threshold 
we successfully completed three acquisitions during fiscal to broaden our product offerings and to incorporate key technologies into our existing products 
our total headcount increased to at march  up from at march  most of the additional headcount represents additions to our r d and application engineering organizations 
our investments in these organizations will enable us to continue to provide leading edge design solutions for our customers in all key areas of chip design 
revenue for fiscal was million  up percent from the prior year 
license sales for the year accounted for approximately percent of total revenue  compared to percent in the prior year 
within the total revenue for fiscal  percent was for orders recognized on a ratable basis or due and payable or cash receipts basis  and percent was for short term time based and perpetual licenses recognized up front 
international sales revenue increased by million or percent in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to a number of customer wins in europe  japan and in the asia pacific region 
for fiscal  cash flows from operations were million  or percent of fiscal revenue 
recent business and asset acquisitions we have acquired companies and purchased technologies that enable us to expand into new markets 
we believe that these acquisitions are a significant factor in magma being able to compete successfully in the eda industry and we expect to make similar acquisitions in the future 
these acquisitions increased our headcount and increased our research and development and sales and marketing expenses 
acquisitions may decrease our liquidity in the short term if earnout milestones are achieved and we must pay contingent cash consideration under the terms of some of these acquisitions 
asset purchases on april   we acquired lemmatis  inc lemmatis  a privately held developer of formal verification technology 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we paid the stockholders of lemmatis initial consideration of approximately million in cash  less  which we withheld to secure the indemnification obligations of the lemmatis stockholders 
in addition to the initial merger consideration  we may pay up to an additional million contingent upon the achievement of certain technology milestones set forth in the merger agreement 
as of march   we have paid million of contingent consideration in connection with achievement of technology milestones 

table of contents on april   we completed the acquisition of mojave  inc mojave  a privately held developer of advanced technology for integrated circuit manufacturability and verification 
the acquisition of mojave allows magma to more comprehensively address its customers needs of designing and verifying semiconductors that are manufacturable with desirable yield and performance 
manufacturability is a key design parameter as semiconductor process technology moves to sub nm geometries 
the total initial purchase price of the mojave acquisition was approximately million and the transaction was accounted for as an asset purchase transaction 
we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of mojave in exchange for initial consideration of million  which consisted of  shares of magma common stock valued at million and million in cash 
in addition to the initial merger consideration  we agreed to pay contingent consideration of up to million  half in stock and half in cash  based on product orders over a period ending march   but such payments are contingent on the achievement of certain technology milestones 
we did not assume any stock options or warrants 
no contingent consideration yet has been earned or paid for milestone achievement as of march  on december   we acquired fortis systems  inc fortis  a privately held developer of optical proximity correction and lithography simulation technology 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we paid the stockholders of fortis initial consideration of approximately million in cash  less  which we withheld to secure the indemnification obligations of the fortis stockholders 
in addition to the initial merger consideration  we may pay up to an additional million contingent upon the achievement of certain technology milestones set forth in the merger agreement 
no contingent consideration yet was earned or paid for milestone achievement as of march  during fiscal  a total of million of contingent cash consideration was earned on the achievement of certain technology milestones as outlined in various prior asset purchase agreements with silicon metrics  sycon  aplus  pdat  siliconcraft and lemmatis  of which million will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the most significant potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we consider the following accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments  asset purchases and business combinations  income taxes and valuation of long lived assets to be our most critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  as modified by sop  which generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on evidence that is specific to us 
if evidence of fair value does not exist for each element of a license arrangement and maintenance is the only undelivered element  then all revenue for the license arrangement is recognized over the term of the agreement 
if evidence of fair value does exist for the elements that have not been delivered  but does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which recognition of revenue for the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual license fee is recognized as revenue immediately 
our revenue recognition policy is detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on form k for the year ended march  management has made significant judgments related to revenue recognition  specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products referred to as an 
table of contents arrangement in the accounting literature we must evaluate whether our fee is fixed or determinable and we must assess whether collectibility is probable 
these judgments are discussed below 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
with respect to each arrangement  we must make a judgment as to whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 
if the fee is fixed or determinable  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of software assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  then the revenue recognized in each period subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria will be the lesser of the aggregate of amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized ratably 
except in cases where we grant extended payment terms to a specific customer  we have determined that our fees are fixed or determinable at the inception of our arrangements based on the following the fee our customers pay for our products is negotiated at the outset of an arrangement and is generally based on the specific volume of products to be delivered 
our license fees are not a function of variable pricing mechanisms such as the number of units distributed or copied by the customer or the expected number of users of the product delivered 
in order for an arrangement to be considered fixed or determinable  of the arrangement fee must be due within one year or less from the order date 
we have a history of collecting fees on such arrangements according to contractual terms 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months are considered not to be fixed or determinable 
collectibility is probable 
in order to recognize revenue  we must make a judgment about the collectibility of the arrangement fee 
our judgment of the collectibility is applied on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial positions and ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash receipts basis as each payment is collected 
license revenue we derive license revenue primarily from licenses of our design and implementation software and  to a much lesser extent  from licenses of our analysis and verification products 
we license our products under time based and perpetual licenses 
we recognize license revenue after the execution of a license agreement and the delivery of the product to the customer  provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  fees are fixed or determinable  collection is probable and there are no remaining obligations other than maintenance 
for licenses where we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  for maintenance  we recognize license revenue using the residual method 
for these licenses  license revenue is recognized in the period in which the license agreement is executed assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
for licenses where we have no vsoe for maintenance  we recognize license revenue ratably over the maintenance period  or if extended payment terms exist  based on the amounts due and payable 
for transactions in which we bundle maintenance for the entire license term into a time based license agreement  no vsoe of fair value exists for each element of the arrangement 
for these agreements  where the only undelivered element is maintenance  we recognize revenue ratably over the contract term 
if an arrangement involves extended payment terms that is  where payment for less than of the license  services and initial post contract support is due within one year of the contract date we recognize revenue to the extent of the lesser of the portion of the amount due and payable or the ratable portion of the entire fee 
for our perpetual licenses and some time based license arrangements  we unbundle maintenance by including maintenance for up to first year of the license term  with maintenance thereafter renewable by the 
table of contents customer at the substantive rates stated in their agreements with us 
in these unbundled licenses  the aggregate renewal period is greater than or equal to the initial maintenance period 
the stated rate for maintenance renewal in these contracts is vsoe of the fair value of maintenance in both our unbundled time based and perpetual licenses 
where the only undelivered element is maintenance  we recognize license revenue using the residual method 
if an arrangement involves extended payment terms  revenue recognized using the residual method is limited to amounts due and payable 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized over time as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
services revenue we derive services revenue primarily from consulting and training for our software products and from maintenance fees for our products 
most of our license agreements include maintenance  generally for a one year period  renewable annually 
services revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance term 
because we have vsoe of fair value for consulting and training services  revenue is recognized as these services are performed or completed 
our consulting and training services are generally not essential to the functionality of the software 
our products are fully functional upon delivery of the product 
additional factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include  but are not limited to degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on our ability to recognize the software license fee 
unbilled accounts receivable unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue that has been recognized in advance of being invoiced to the customer 
in all cases  the revenue and unbilled receivables are for contracts which are non cancelable  there are no contingencies and where the customer has taken delivery of both the software and the encryption key required to operate the software 
we typically generate invoices days in advance of contractual due dates  and we invoice the entire amount of the unbilled accounts receivable within one year from the contract inception 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate using the factors described above 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration in any one customer  industry or geographic region 
as of march   one customer accounted for approximately of total receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
if actual losses are significantly greater than the allowance we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reported net loss 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our allowance  this would decrease our general and administrative expenses and our reported net income would increase 
accounting for asset purchases and business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired assets and business combinations to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 

table of contents critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  acquired workforce and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting in changes in the purchase price allocation 
goodwill impairment our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting unit  and determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit 
any impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of intangibles and long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that we record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the amount of income taxes we pay could be subject to audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities  which could result in proposed assessments 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these tax matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions 
we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing 
table of contents the amount of the valuation allowance 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
future reversals or increases to our valuation allowance could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
strategic investments in privately held companies our strategic equity investments consist of preferred stock and convertible notes that are convertible into preferred or common stock of several privately held companies 
as of march   none of the notes have been converted 
the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic equity investments in non marketable equity securities privately held companies totaled million at march  our ability to recover our investments in private  non marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute on their business plans and how well their products are accepted  as well as their ability to obtain additional capital funding to continue operations 
in the current equity market environment  their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers and private sales  may be significantly constrained 
under our accounting policy  the carrying value of a non marketable investment is the amount paid for the investment unless it has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its estimated fair value 
we review all of our investments periodically for impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the fair value analysis requires significant judgment 
this analysis includes assessment of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise  such as when we hold contractual rights that give us a preference over the rights of other investors 
as the equity markets have declined significantly over the past few years  we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities 
if equity market conditions do not improve  as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds  the funds may not be available to them  or they may receive lower valuations  with more onerous investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments will likely become impaired 
however  we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future  or the extent or timing of individual impairments 
we recorded impairment charges related to these non marketable equity investments of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
results of operations revenue overview revenue consists of licenses revenue and services revenue 
license revenue consists of fees for time based or perpetual licenses of our products 
services revenue consists of fees for services  such as post contract customer support pcs  customer training and consulting 
we recognize revenue based on the specific terms and conditions of the license contracts with our customer for our products and services as described in detail above in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
for management reporting and analysis purposes we classify our revenue into the following four categories ratable due payable cash receipts turns or up front perpetual or time based we classify our license arrangements as either bundled or unbundled 
bundled license contracts include maintenance with the license fee and do not include optional maintenance periods 
unbundled license contracts have separate maintenance fees and include optional maintenance periods 

table of contents we use this classification of license revenue to provide greater insight into the reporting and monitoring of trends in the components of our revenue and to assist us in managing our business 
it is important to note that the characterization of an individual contract may change over time 
for example  a contract originally characterized as ratable may be redefined as cash receipts if that customer has difficulty in making payments in a timely fashion 
in cases where a contract has been re characterized for management reporting purposes  prior periods are not restated to reflect that change 
bundled and unbundled licenses ratable 
for bundled time based licenses  we recognize license revenue ratably over the contract term  or as customer payments become due and payable  if less 
the revenue for these bundled arrangements for both license and maintenance is classified as license revenue in our statement of operations 
for unbundled time based with a term of less than months  we recognize license revenue ratably over the license term  or as customer payments become due and payable  if earlier 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we refer to both these types of licenses generally as ratable and we generally refer to all time based licenses recognized on a ratable basis as long term  independent of the actual length of term of the license 
we classify unbundled perpetual or time based licenses with a term of fifteen months or greater based on the payment term structure  as due and payable  cash receipts or perpetual unbundled licenses due and payable time based licenses with long term payments 
for unbundled time based licenses where the payment terms extend greater than one year from the arrangement effective date  we recognize license revenue on a due and payable basis and we recognize maintenance and services revenue ratably over the maintenance term 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we refer to this type of license generally as due and payable long term time based licenses 
unbundled licenses cash receipts 
we recognize revenue from customers who have not met our predetermined credit criteria on a cash receipts basis to the extent that revenue has otherwise been earned 
such customers generally order short term time based licenses or separate annual maintenance 
we recognize license revenue as we receive cash payments from these customers 
maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term after the customer has remitted payment 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we refer to this type of license revenue as cash receipts 
unbundled licenses turns perpetual license or time based licenses with short term payments 
for unbundled time based and perpetual licenses  we recognize license revenue upon shipment as long as the payment terms require the customer to pay of the license fee and the initial period of pcs within one year from the agreement date and payments are generally linear 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance term 
in all of these cases  the contracts are non cancelable  and the customer has taken delivery of both the software and the encryption key required to operate the software 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we refer to this type of license generally as turns  where the license is either perpetual or time based 
our license revenue in any given quarter depends upon the mix and volume of perpetual or short term licenses ordered during the quarter and the amount of long term ratable or due and payable  and cash receipts license revenue recognized during the quarter 
in general  we refer to license revenue recognized from perpetual or time based licenses during the quarter as up front or turns revenue  for management reporting and analysis purposes 
all other types of revenue are generally referred to as revenue from backlog 
we set our revenue targets for any given period based  in part  upon an assumption that we will achieve a certain level of orders and a certain mix of short term licenses 
the precise mix of orders fluctuates substantially from period to period and affects the revenue we recognize in the period 
if we achieve our target level of total orders but are unable to achieve our target license mix  we may not meet our revenue targets if we have more than expected long term licenses or may exceed them if we have more than expected short term or perpetual licenses 
if we achieve the target license mix but the overall level of orders is below the target level  then we may not meet our revenue targets as described in the risk factors below

these orders came from existing customers who extended license periods and added license capacity due to the continued proliferation of existing and new magma products  principally blast fusion apx into their design groups 
one customer accounted for greater than of the revenue generated in fiscal license revenue as a percentage of revenue slightly decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal license revenue increased in fiscal due to large orders executed in north america  europe and japan 
these orders came from sales to new customers  the number of which increased by more than from the prior year  future proliferation into our customers design groups and the addition of new products  principally blast fusion apx 
during fiscal we added more than new customers 
two customers each accounted for more than percent of the full year revenue  combining for a total of percent 
license revenue as a percentage of revenue slightly increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal service revenue increased in both fiscal and fiscal compared to their respective preceding fiscal years primarily due to our large customers accelerating their deployment of our licenses and placing additional services orders 
service revenue as a percentage of total revenue slightly increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and slightly decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents domestic revenue increased in both fiscal and fiscal compared to their respective preceding fiscal years due primarily to our existing customers in north america purchasing additional licenses and the new technology products 
domestic revenue as a percentage of total revenue slightly increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  but slightly decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal international revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our existing customers in japan and asia pacific purchasing additional capacity of existing licenses and licenses to new technology products 
international revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to our existing customers in europe and japan purchasing additional licenses and the addition of new technology products 
international revenue as a percentage of total revenue slightly decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal international revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit cost of revenue includes personnel and related costs to provide product support  consulting services and training 
cost of revenue also includes software production costs  product packaging  documentation  amortization of acquired developed technology and other intangible assets  and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
management allocates these expenses to cost of upfront licenses  cost of time based licenses and cost of services  based on orders booked within a given quarter 
accordingly  the costs allocated to upfront licenses  time based licenses and services are heavily dependent on the mix of software orders received during any given period 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million  or  in amortization of acquired developed technology and other intangible assets resulting from additional business combinations and asset acquisitions completed during fiscal and this increase was partially offset by the lower growth rate of related to payroll related expenses for application engineers 
our total revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of license revenue  which has a higher gross margin compared to service revenue  accounting for a greater percentage of total revenue in fiscal this increase was offset by an increase in amortization of acquired developed technology and other intangible assets of million as a result of additional business combination and asset acquisitions completed during fiscal

the increase was also caused by higher amortization of acquired technology of million and higher allocated common expenses eg  facility related expenses of million resulting from the headcount increase 
the remainder of the fluctuation in research and development expenses was accounted for by other individually insignificant items 
research and development expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in payroll related expenses of million as we more than doubled our research and development headcount through direct hiring as well as business acquisitions during fiscal the remainder of the increase was caused by increases in common expenses eg  facility related expenses of million and software maintenance costs of million  both of which were caused by the headcount increase 
these increases were offset by a decrease in professional service fees of million in fiscal as we utilized more internal resources to conduct our internal research and development projects 
the remainder of the fluctuation in research and development expenses between fiscal and fiscal was accounted for by other individually insignificant items 
we expect our research and development expenses in fiscal to increase as a percentage of revenue compared to the amount in fiscal  attributable to increased compensation costs 
in process research and development expenses of million in fiscal consisted primarily of a charge of million recorded in connection with our acquisition of mojave  inc in april the charge was recorded based on management s final purchase price allocation 
the remainder of the in process research and development expenses in fiscal was accounted for in connection with the fortis acquisition in december in process research and development expense of million in fiscal represents the charge recorded in connection with our acquisition of silicon metrics corporation during fiscal 
table of contents sales and marketing expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in payroll related expenses of million as we increased our sales and marketing headcount by primarily application engineers  through direct hire as well as business acquisitions during fiscal the increase was also caused by an increase in commission expense of million as a result of sales and bookings growth experienced in fiscal sales and marketing expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in payroll related expenses of million as we increased our sales and marketing headcount by  through direct hire as well as business acquisitions during the increase was also caused by an increase in commission expense of million as a result of sales and bookings growth experienced in fiscal the remainder of the fluctuation in sales and marketing expenses was accounted for by other individually insignificant items 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses in fiscal will increase moderately  while declining as a percentage of revenue compared with the amount in fiscal as our sales and marketing headcount will remain at approximately the same level 
general and administrative expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increases in professional service fees of million  facility related expenses of million  asset depreciation of million and an increase in payroll related expenses of million as we increased our general and administrative headcount by in fiscal  partially offset by reduced allocated cost of million due to higher headcount in other functional areas 
the increase in professional service fees in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in our activities related to the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as legal expenses related to patent litigation with synopsys  inc general and administrative expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in payroll related expenses of million as we increased our general and administrative headcount by in fiscal in order to support our growing operations 
the increase was offset by a decrease in legal expense in fiscal as we did not incur one time litigation settlement costs we recorded such costs of million in fiscal 
the remainder of the fluctuation in general and administrative expenses was accounted for by other individually insignificant items 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal compared to as we continue to see the impact of legal expenses related to patent litigation with synopsys and professional services related to compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of restructuring costs of million in both fiscal and fiscal consisted of employee termination charges resulting from the company s realignment to current business conditions 
no such charge was recorded in fiscal amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to result of the full fiscal year amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with business combinations and asset purchases completed in the third quarter of fiscal  as well as amortization of intangible assets acquired in fiscal there were no acquisitions prior to the third quarter of fiscal the intangible assets amortized include trademarks  customer contracts  customer relationships  no shop rights and assembled workforces that were identified in the purchase price allocation for each business combination and asset purchase transaction 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million related to the acquisition of veratest  a decrease in deferred stock based compensation charges of million related to the stock options granted to one of the company s senior executives in fiscal  and a decrease in amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million recorded in connection with our ipo in november 
these decreases in amortization of deferred stock based compensation in fiscal compared to fiscal were partially offset by the recording of stock based compensation expenses of million related to our mojave acquisition and million related to restricted stock issued under our key contributor long term incentive plan

other expense  net increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a negative change in foreign exchange gain loss of million in fiscal  partially offset by a million decrease in charges associated with other than temporary impairment in our strategic investments 
the increase of foreign exchange loss in fiscal was caused by an unfavorable exchange rate fluctuation between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
other expense  net in fiscal decreased primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange gain of million  offset by an increase in a charge associated with a loss in strategic equity investments of million 
the increase in foreign exchange gain was caused by a favorable exchange rate fluctuation between the us dollar and the japanese yen as well as the us dollar and the euro during fiscal the charge associated with loss in strategic equity investments was determined based on our periodic review of investee company financial performance 
we made additional net strategic equity investments of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the remainder of the fluctuation in other expense  net was accounted for by other individually insignificant items 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective tax rates vary from the us statutory rate primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance  state taxes  foreign income at other than us rates  deferred compensation  in process research and development  research and development credits  and foreign withholding taxes

the income tax expense is due primarily to alternative minimum taxes  state taxes  income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions  and foreign withholding taxes 
we are in a net deferred tax asset position  for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded 
we will continue to provide a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realizable 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis

on december   we acquired fortis systems  inc fortis  a developer of optical proximity correction and lithography simulation technology  for cash consideration of approximately million  less  withheld to secure indemnification obligations 
in addition  we may pay up to an additional million upon the achievement of technology milestones set forth in the acquisition agreement 
as of march   no contingent consideration has been paid under the agreement because the milestones have not yet been achieved 
on april   we completed the acquisition of mojave  inc mojave  a privately held developer of advanced technology for integrated circuit manufacturability and verification 
the acquisition of mojave will allow magma to more comprehensively address its customers needs of designing and verifying semiconductors 
table of contents that are manufacturable with desirable yield and performance 
manufacturability is a key design parameter as semiconductor process technology moves to sub nm geometries 
the total initial purchase price of the mojave acquisition was approximately million and the transaction has been accounted for as an asset purchase transaction 
we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of mojave in exchange for initial consideration of million  which consisted of million in cash and  shares of magma common stock valued at million 
in addition to the initial merger consideration  we agreed to pay contingent consideration of up to million  half in stock and half in cash  based on product orders over a period ending march   but such payments are contingent on the achievement of certain technology milestones 
as of march   no contingent consideration has been paid under the agreement because the milestones have not yet been achieved

on may   we issued million principal amount of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due may  the notes resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes do not bear coupon interest and are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  for an aggregate of approximately million shares 
the notes are subordinated to our existing and future senior indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
we may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity date 
in order to minimize the dilutive effect from the issuance of the notes  we undertook the following additional transactions concurrent with the issuance of the notes we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at a price of per share  or approximately million  from one of the initial purchasers of the notes  and those shares were retired as of may  we entered into convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions with credit suisse first boston international csfb international with respect to our common stock 
under the convertible bond hedge arrangement  csfb international agreed to sell us  for per share  up to million shares of our common stock to cover our obligation to issue shares upon conversion of the notes 
in addition  we issued csfb international a warrant to purchase up to million shares of common stock for a purchase price of per share 
purchases and sales under this arrangement may be made only upon expiration of the notes or their earlier conversion to the extent thereof 
both transactions may be settled at our option either in cash or net shares  and will expire on the earlier of a conversion event or the maturity of the convertible debt on may  the net cost incurred in connection with these arrangements  which consists of the million cost of the convertible bond hedge  offset in part by the million proceeds from the issuance of the warrant  was approximately million

the repurchase leaves approximately million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
at the same time we terminated a portion approximately percent of the hedging arrangements 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was increased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in cash from customers and a million change in prepaid and other assets balances 
prepaid and other assets decreased by million in 
table of contents fiscal and increased by million in fiscal these increases were partially offset by a million increase in costs and operating expenses and a million increase in payments associated with accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increase in cash from customers was primarily due to growth in revenue and strong cash collection during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in prepaid expenses was primarily caused by decreases in prepaid commission expense and prepaid software maintenance expense 
prepaid commission decreased during fiscal primarily due to orders recorded in fiscal of approximately million for which we paid advance commissions but where the entire order value has not been recognized as revenue in fiscal the advance commission balance decreases during years after fiscal as these orders are recognized as revenue in subsequent periods 
the payment of accrued liabilities during fiscal was primarily related to a payout of accrued bonuses during the period 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march  cash was provided by net income adjusted for non cash related items and changes in working capital including increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
the increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are primarily due to the growth in our operations including headcount 
our headcount increased by in fiscal cash was also provided by an increase in other long term liabilities  which primarily represented deferred rent related to the new lease agreement signed in fiscal for our headquarters facility 
these increases were offset by cash used for changes in working capital including increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets 
accounts receivable increased due to the timing of installment billings to customers 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to increases in prepaid commission and prepaid maintenance related to a licensed technology  which was obtained in march prepaid commission increased during fiscal primarily due to orders recorded by us in fiscal of approximately million for which we paid advance commissions but the entire order value has not been recognized as revenue as of march  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march  for the year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income of million and non cash items of million of depreciation and amortization  million of amortization of stock based compensation  million of provision for doubtful accounts  and million related to loss on write down of investments

net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal the sole source of cash was million of cash received from the exercise of stock options and shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan during the period 
we used million to repurchase  shares of common stock on the open market  as authorized by the board of directors in july net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal the primary source of cash was the net proceeds received from issuance of convertible subordinated notes the debt offering of million 
in connection with the debt offering  we also issued a warrant exercisable for shares of our common stock to a bank and received additional cash proceeds of million  while we paid million in cash for entering into a bond hedge contract with the same bank 
other sources of cash included million of cash received from the exercise of stock options and shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and million of repayment received for the notes receivable from stockholders 
these cash inflows were offset by our million repayment of notes payable to a bank and our repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million in order to minimize the dilutive effect of the debt offering 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  which primarily consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock of million 
capital resources we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure requirements in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may use cash or need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in more dilution to our existing stockholders 
financing arrangements may not be available to us  or may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
our acquisition agreements related to certain business combination and asset purchase transactions obligate us to pay certain contingent cash compensation based on continued employment and meeting certain revenue or project milestones 
total cash contingent compensation that could be paid under our acquisition agreements assuming all contingencies are met is million as of march  contractual obligations as of march   our principal commitments consisted of operating leases  the future amount of which was million through fiscal for office facilities  and repayment of the convertible subordinated notes of million due in fiscal although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we anticipate a substantial increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure  and personnel 

table of contents the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations convertible subordinated notes purchase obligations total purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of march  although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
indemnification obligations we enter into standard license agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to these agreements  we agree to indemnify our customers for losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of any patent  copyright  or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products 
these indemnification obligations have perpetual terms 
our normal business practice is to limit the maximum amount of indemnification to the amount received from the customer 
on occasion  the maximum amount of indemnification we may be required to make may exceed its normal business practices 
we estimate the fair value of its indemnification obligations as insignificant  based on our historical experience concerning product and patent infringement claims 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for indemnification under these agreements as of march  we have agreements whereby our officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have a directors and officers insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of march  in connection with recent business acquisitions  we agreed to assume  or cause our subsidiaries to assume  indemnification obligations to the officers and directors of acquired companies 
warranties we offer our customers a warranty that our products will conform to the documentation provided with the products 
to date  there have been no payments or material costs incurred related to fulfilling these warranty obligations 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these warranties as of march  we assess the need for a warranty accrual on a quarterly basis  and there can be no guarantee that a warranty accrual will not become necessary in the future 

table of contents factors that may affect our business and future results of operations and financial condition our business faces many risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
we were incorporated in april and introduced our first principal software product  blast fusion  in april we have a limited history of generating revenue from our software products  and the revenue and income potential of our business and market is still unproven 
as a result of our short operating history  we have limited financial data that can be used to evaluate our business 
we have only been profitable for eight of the last twelve fiscal quarters  and we were not profitable prior to fiscal our software products represent a new approach to the challenges presented in the electronic design automation market  which to date has been dominated by established companies with longer operating histories 
key markets within the electronic design automation industry may fail to adopt our proprietary technologies and software products 
any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of our limited operating history and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by relatively young companies 
we have a history of losses prior to fiscal and have an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of march   if we do not increase profitability  the public trading price of our stock would be likely to decline 
we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of march  although we achieved profitability in fiscal and fiscal  we incurred losses in prior years and for the year ended march  if we incur new losses  or do not increase profitability at a level expected by securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock is likely to decline 
if we incur net losses  we may not be able to maintain or increase our number of employees or our investment in capital equipment  sales  marketing  and research and development programs  and we may not be able to continue to operate 
our quarterly results are difficult to predict  and if we miss quarterly financial expectations  our stock price could decline 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict  and fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
it is likely that our operating results in some periods will be below investor expectations 
if this happens  the market price of our common stock is likely to decline 
fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results may be caused by many factors  including size and timing of customer orders  which are received unevenly and unpredictably throughout a fiscal year  the mix of products licensed and types of license agreements  our ability to recognize revenue in a given quarter  higher than anticipated costs in connection with patent litigation with synopsys  inc  timing of customer license payments  the relative mix of time based licenses bundled with maintenance  unbundled time based license agreements and perpetual license agreements  each of which has different revenue recognition practices  size and timing of revenue recognized in advance of actual customer billings and customers with graduated payment schedules which may result in higher accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding dso  the relative mix of our license and services revenue  
table of contents our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers  changes in our pricing and discounting practices and licensing terms and those of our competitors  changes in the level of our operating expenses  including increases in incentive compensation payments that may be associated with future revenue growth  changes in the interpretation of the authoritative literature under which we recognize revenue  the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or our competitors  and the integration  by us or our competitors  of newly developed or acquired products 
we currently face a patent infringement suit brought by synopsys  inc  and we may face additional intellectual property infringement claims or other claims against us or our customers that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
on september   synopsys  inc  filed suit against us for patent infringement please see the discussion in item legal proceedings for further detail  and in the future other parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers 
we have also acquired or may hereafter acquire software as a result of our past or future acquisitions  and we may be subject to claims that such software infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties 
our products may be found to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties  including third party patents 
in addition  many of our contracts contain provisions in which we agree to indemnify our customers from third party intellectual property infringement claims that are brought against them based on their use of our products 
also  we may be unaware of filed patent applications that relate to our software products 
we believe the patent portfolios of our competitors are far larger than ours  and this may increase the risk that they may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross licenses 
due to intellectual property litigation  including the synopsys litigation  we could lose critical proprietary rights and incur substantial unexpected operating costs 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention from our business 
if there is a successful claim of infringement  we may be ordered to pay substantial monetary damages including punitive damages  we may be prevented from distributing all or some of our products  and we may be required to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements  which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure to develop non infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business 
in addition  we are often involved in or threatened with commercial litigation unrelated to intellectual property infringement claims and in labor litigation  and we may acquire companies that are actively engaged in such litigation 
we may not be successful in defending some or all claims that may be brought against us 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can result in substantial expense and could divert the efforts of our management and technical personnel from our business 
furthermore  publicly announced developments in litigation that are perceived to be adverse to us could cause our stock price to decline sharply and suddenly  which could result in securities litigation against us 
we may not be able to hire and or retain the number of qualified personnel required for our business  particularly engineering personnel  which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow 
competition in our industry for senior management  technical  sales  marketing and other key personnel is intense 
if we are unable to retain our existing personnel  or attract and train additional qualified personnel  our growth may be limited due to a lack of capacity to develop and market our products 

table of contents in particular  we continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy 
our success depends on our ability to identify  hire  train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in integrated circuit design 
specifically  we need to continue to attract and retain field application engineers to work with our direct sales force to technically qualify new sales opportunities and perform design work to demonstrate our products capabilities to customers during the benchmark evaluation process 
competition for qualified engineers is intense  particularly in silicon valley where our headquarters is located 
retaining our employees has become more challenging due to the decline in our stock price over the past several years 
many of the stock options held by our employees have an exercise price that is significantly higher than the current trading price of our stock  and these underwater options do not serve their purpose as incentives for our employees to remain with magma 
although  as discussed below  we are attempting to address this problem in part by implementing a stock option exchange program that will allow eligible employees to exchange existing underwater options for options exercisable for a smaller number of shares at the current trading price  we cannot guarantee that this program will be approved by our stockholders 
in addition  the increased volatility of our stock price due to the pendency of  and developments in  the synopsys litigation may affect employee morale 
if we lose the services of a significant number of our employees and or if we cannot hire additional employees  we will be unable to increase our sales or implement or maintain our growth strategy 
our success is highly dependent on the technical  sales  marketing and managerial contributions of key individuals  and we may be unable to recruit and retain these personnel 
we depend on our senior executives and certain key research and development and sales and marketing personnel  who are critical to our business 
we do not have long term employment agreements with our key employees  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
furthermore  our larger competitors may be able to offer more generous compensation packages to executives and key employees  and therefore we risk losing key personnel to those competitors 
if we lose the services of any of our key personnel  our product development processes and sales efforts could be slowed 
we may also incur increased operating expenses and be required to divert the attention of our senior executives to search for their replacements 
the integration of our new executives or any new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations 
customer payment defaults may cause us to be unable to recognize revenue from backlog  and changes in the type of orders comprising backlog could affect the proportion of revenue recognized from backlog each quarter  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and on investor expectations 
a portion of our revenue backlog is variable based on volume of usage of our products by the customers or includes specific future deliverables or is recognized in revenue on a cash receipts basis 
management has estimated variable usage based on customers forecasts  but there can be no assurance that these estimates will be realized 
in addition  it is possible that customers from whom we expect to derive revenue from backlog will default and as a result we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog 
if a customer defaults and fails to pay amounts owed  or if the level of defaults increases  our bad debt expense is likely to increase 
any material payment default by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle  and the large size of some orders  makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue and increases the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations  which could harm our stock price 
customers for our software products typically commit significant resources to evaluate available software 
the complexity of our products requires us to spend substantial time and effort to assist potential customers in evaluating our software and in benchmarking it against our competition 
as the complexity of the products we sell increases  we expect the sales cycle to lengthen 
in addition  potential customers may be limited in their current spending by existing time based licenses with their legacy vendors 
in these cases  customers delay a significant new commitment to our software until the term of the existing license has expired 
also  because our products 
table of contents require a significant investment of time and cost by our customers  we must target those individuals within the customer s organization who are able to make these decisions on behalf of their companies 
these individuals tend to be senior management in an organization  typically at the vice president level 
we may face difficulty identifying and establishing contact with such individuals 
even after initial acceptance  the negotiation and documentation processes can be lengthy 
our sales cycle typically ranges between three and nine months  but can be longer 
any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter could cause our operating results to fall below expectations 
we rely on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue  and our revenue could decline due to delays of customer orders or the failure of existing customers to renew licenses or if we are unable to maintain or develop relationships with current or potential customers 
our business depends on sales to a small number of customers 
in fiscal  we had one customer that accounted for more than of our revenue  and our top three customers together accounted for approximately of our revenue 
in fiscal  we had two customers that accounted for or more of our revenue  and our top three customers together accounted for approximately of our revenue 
in fiscal  we had one customer that accounted for more than of our revenue and our top three customers together accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we expect that we will continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
if we fail to sell sufficient quantities of our products and services to one or more customers in any particular period  or if a large customer reduces purchases of our products or services  defers orders  or fails to renew licenses  our business and operating results will be harmed 
most of our customers license our software under time based licensing agreements  with terms that typically vary from months to months 
most of our license agreements automatically expire at the end of the term unless the customer renews the license with us or purchases a perpetual license 
if our customers do not renew their licenses  we may not be able to maintain our current revenue or may not generate additional revenue 
some of our license agreements allow customers to terminate an agreement prior to its expiration under limited circumstances for example  if our products do not meet specified performance requirements or goals 
if these agreements are terminated prior to expiration or we are unable to collect under these agreements  our revenue may decline 
some contracts with extended payment terms provide for payments which are weighted toward the later part of the contract term 
accordingly  as the payment terms are extended  the revenue from these contracts is not recognized evenly over the contract term  but is recognized as the lesser of the cumulative amounts due and payable or ratably for bundled agreements  and as amounts become due and payable for unbundled agreements  at each period end 
revenue recognized under these arrangements will be higher in the later part of the contract term  which puts our revenue recognition in the future at greater risk of the customer s continuing credit worthiness 
in addition  some of our customers have extended payment terms  which creates additional credit risk 
we compete against companies that hold a large share of the electronic design automation market and competition is increasing among eda vendors as customers tightly control their eda spending and use fewer vendors to meet their needs 
if we cannot compete successfully  we will not gain market share and our revenue could decline 
we currently compete with companies that hold dominant shares in the electronic design automation market  such as cadence and synopsys 
each of these companies has a longer operating history and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
our competitors are better able to offer aggressive discounts on their products  a practice they often employ 
our competitors offer a more comprehensive range of products than we do  for example  we do not offer logic simulation  layout verification  full feature custom layout editing  analog or mixed signal products  which can sometimes be an impediment to our winning a particular customer order 
in addition  our industry has traditionally viewed acquisitions as an effective strategy for growth in products and market share and our competitors greater cash resources and higher market capitalization may give them a 
table of contents relative advantage over us in buying companies with promising new chip design products or companies that may be too large for us to acquire without a strain on our resources 
competition in the eda market has increased as customers rationalized their eda spending by using products from fewer eda vendors and continued consolidation in the electronic design automation market could intensify this trend 
competitive pressures may prevent us from gaining market share  require us to reduce the price of products and services or cause us to lose existing customers  which could harm our business 
to execute our business strategy successfully  we must continue to increase our sales worldwide 
if we fail to do so in a timely manner or at all  we may not be able to gain market share and our business and operating results could suffer 
also  a variety of small companies continue to emerge  developing and introducing new products 
any of these companies could become a significant competitor in the future 
we also compete with the internal chip design automation development groups of our existing and potential customers 
therefore  these customers may not require  or may be reluctant to purchase  products offered by independent vendors 
our competitors may develop or acquire new products or technologies that have the potential to replace our existing or new product offerings 
the introduction of these new or additional products by competitors may cause potential customers to defer purchases of our products 
if we fail to compete successfully  we will not gain market share and our business will fail 
we may not be successful in integrating the operations of acquired companies and acquired technology 
we expect to continuously evaluate the possibility of accelerating our growth through acquisitions  as is customary in the electronic design automation industry 
achieving the anticipated benefits of past and possible future acquisitions will depend in part upon whether we can integrate the operations  products and technology of acquired companies with our operations  products and technology in a timely and cost effective manner 
the process of integrating with acquired companies and acquired technology is complex  expensive and time consuming  and may cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the product development and sales activities and operations of both companies 
in addition  the earnout arrangements we use  and expect to continue to use  to consummate some of our acquisitions  pursuant to which we agreed to pay additional amounts of contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue  bookings or product development milestones  can sometimes complicate integration efforts 
we cannot be sure that any part or all of the integration will be accomplished on a timely basis  or at all 
assimilating previously acquired companies such as silicon metrics corporation and mojave  inc  or any other companies we may seek to acquire in the future  involves a number of other risks  including  but not limited to adverse effects on existing customer relationships  such as cancellation of orders or the loss of key customers  difficulties in integrating or an inability to retain key employees of the acquired company  the risk that earnouts based on revenue will prove difficult to administer due to the complexities of revenue recognition accounting  the risk that actions incentivized by earnout provisions will ultimately prove not to be in magma s best interest as its interests may change over time  difficulties in integrating the operations of the acquired company  such as information technology resources  manufacturing processes  and financial and operational data  difficulties in integrating the technologies of the acquired company into our products  diversion of management attention  potential incompatibility of business cultures  potential dilution to existing stockholders if we have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  and additional expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets 

table of contents our operating results may be harmed if our customers do not adopt  or are slow to adopt  nanometer design geometries 
many magma customers are currently working on nanometer designs 
magma continues to work toward developing and enhancing its product line in anticipation of increased customer demand for nanometer sub nanometer design geometries 
similarly  magma has acquired mojave personnel and technology to better address customers needs for designing and verifying semiconductors that are manufacturable with higher yield and performance  which is a key design parameter when moving to nanometer geometries 
notwithstanding our efforts to support nanometer geometries  customers may fail to adopt or may be slower to adopt nanometer geometries and we may be unable to convince our customers to purchase our related software products 
accordingly  any revenues we receive from enhancements to our products or acquired technologies may be less than the development or acquisition costs 
if customers fail to adopt nanometer design geometries or are slow to adopt nanometer design geometries  our operating results may be harmed 
because many of our current competitors have pre existing relationships with our current and potential customers  we might not be able to gain market share  which could harm our operations 
many of our competitors  including cadence and synopsys  have established relationships with our current and potential customers and can devote substantial resources aimed at preventing us from establishing or enhancing our customer relationships 
these existing relationships can make it difficult for us to obtain additional customers due to the substantial investment that these potential customers have already made in their current design flows 
if we are unable to gain market share due to these relationships with our potential customers  our operating results could be harmed 
our operating results will be significantly harmed if chip designers do not adopt blast fusion 
blast fusion has accounted for a significant majority of our revenue since our inception and we believe that revenue from blast fusion and related products will account for most of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
if integrated circuit designers do not continue to adopt blast fusion  our operating results will be significantly harmed 
we must continue market penetration of blast fusion to achieve our growth strategy and financial success 
if the industries into which we sell our products experience recession or other cyclical effects affecting our customers research and development budgets  our revenue would be likely to decline 
demand for our products is driven by new integrated circuit design projects 
the demand from semiconductor and systems companies is uncertain and difficult to predict 
slower growth in the semiconductor and systems industries  a reduced number of design starts  reduction of electronic design automation budgets or continued consolidation among our customers would harm our business and financial condition 
we have experienced slower growth in revenue than we anticipated as a result of the prolonged downturn and decreased spending by our customers in the semiconductor and systems industries 
the primary customers for our products are companies in the communications  computing  consumer electronics  networking and semiconductor industries 
any significant downturn in our customers markets or in general economic conditions that results in the cutback of research and development budgets or the delay of software purchases would likely result in lower demand for our products and services and could harm our business 
for example  the united states economy  including the semiconductor industry  experienced a slowdown starting in  which negatively impacted and may continue to impact our business and operating results 
while the semiconductor industry experienced a moderate recovery in and  our customers have remained cautious  and it is not yet clear when increased r d spending will occur 
the continuing threat of terrorist attacks in the united states  the ongoing events in iraq and other worldwide events including those in the middle east have increased uncertainty in the united states economy 
if the economy declines as a result of this economic  political and social turmoil  existing customers may delay their implementation of our software products and prospective customers may decide not to adopt our software products  either of which could negatively impact our business and operating results 

table of contents in recent years  some asian countries have experienced significant economic difficulties  including devaluation and instability  business failures and a depressed business environment 
these difficulties triggered a significant downturn in the semiconductor market  resulting in reduced budgets for chip design tools  which  in turn  negatively impacted us 
we have experienced delayed orders and slower deployment of our products under new orders as a result of reduced budgets for chip design tools 
in addition  the electronics industry has historically been subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in demand for its products  and this trend may continue in the future 
these industry downturns have been  and may continue to be  characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices 
difficulties in developing and achieving market acceptance of new products and delays in planned release dates of our software products and upgrades may harm our business 
to succeed  we will need to develop innovative new products 
we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all required future innovations 
expanding into new technologies or extending our product line into areas we have not previously addressed may be more costly or difficult than anticipated 
also  any revenue that we receive from enhancements or new generations of our proprietary software products may be less than the costs of development 
if we fail to develop and market new products in a timely manner  our reputation and our business will suffer 
our costs of customer engagement and support are high  so our gross margin may decrease if we incur higher than expected costs associated with providing support services in the future or if we reduce our prices 
because of the complexity of our products  we typically incur high field application engineering support costs to engage new customers and assist them in their evaluations of our products 
if we fail to manage our customer engagement and support costs  our operating results could suffer 
in addition  our gross margin may decrease if we are unable to manage support costs associated with the services revenue we generate or if we reduce prices in response to competitive pressure 
product defects could cause us to lose customers and revenue  or to incur unexpected expenses 
our products depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
our customers may use our products with other companies products  which also contain complex software 
if our software does not meet our customers performance requirements  our customer relationships may suffer 
also  a limited number of our contracts include specified ongoing performance criteria 
if our products fail to meet these criteria  it may lead to termination of these agreements and loss of future revenue 
complex software often contains errors 
any failure or poor performance of our software or the third party software with which it is integrated could result in delayed market acceptance of our software products  delays in product shipments  unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to identify the source of errors or to correct errors  damage to our reputation  delayed or lost revenue  and product liability claims 
our product functions are often critical to our customers  especially because of the resources our customers expend on the design and fabrication of integrated circuits 
many of our licensing agreements contain provisions to provide a limited warranty  which provides the customer with a right of refund for the license fees if we are unable to correct errors reported during the warranty period 
if our contractual limitations are unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction or if we are exposed to claims that are not covered by insurance  a successful claim could harm our business 
we currently carry insurance coverages and limits that we believe are consistent with similarly situated companies within the eda industry 

table of contents much of our business is international  which exposes us to risks inherent to doing business internationally that could harm our business 
we also intend to expand our international operations 
if our revenue from this expansion does not exceed the expenses associated with this expansion  our business and operating results could suffer 
we generated of our total revenue from sales outside north america for fiscal  compared to for the fiscal and for fiscal while most of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars  our international operating expenses have been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the relative costs of our overseas operations  which could reduce our operating margins 
the expansion of our international operations includes the maintenance of sales offices in europe  the middle east  and the asia pacific region 
if our revenue from international operations does not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining our international operations  our business could suffer 
additional risks we face in conducting business internationally include difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations across different geographic areas  changes in currency exchange rates and controls  uncertainty regarding tax and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions  the possible lack of financial and political stability in foreign countries  preventing overseas sales growth  on going events in iraq  and the effects of terrorist attacks in the united states and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide 
future changes in accounting standards  specifically changes affecting revenue recognition  could cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations 
future changes in accounting standards for interpretations thereof  specifically those changes affecting software revenue recognition  could require us to change our methods of revenue recognition 
these changes could result in deferral of revenue recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or in accelerated recognition of deferred revenue to current periods  each of which could cause shortfalls in meeting the expectations of investors and securities analysts 
our stock price could decline as a result of any shortfall 
implementation of internal controls reporting and attestation requirements  as further described below  will impose additional financial and administrative obligations on us and will cause us to incur substantial implementation costs from third party consultants  which could adversely affect our results 
changes in laws and regulations that affect the governance of public companies have increased our operating expenses and will continue to do so 
recently enacted changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and the listing requirements for the nasdaq stock market have imposed new duties on us and on our executives  directors  attorneys and independent registered public accounting firms 
in order to comply with these new rules  we have hired additional personnel and use additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  which have increased and are likely to continue increasing our operating expenses 
in particular  we have incurred and will continue to incur additional administrative expenses as we implement section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls 
for example  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the implementation  documentation and testing of our control systems 
management time associated with these compliance efforts necessarily reduces time available for other operating activities  which could adversely affect operating results 
if we are unable to achieve full and 
table of contents timely compliance with these regulatory requirements  we could be required to incur additional costs  expend additional management time on remedial efforts and make related public disclosures that could adversely affect our stock price and result in securities litigation 
forecasting the company s tax rates is complex and subject to uncertainty 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance that may be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
these assumptions  judgments and estimates are difficult to make due to their complexity and the relevant tax law is often changing 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including deferred stock based compensation and write offs of acquired in process research and development  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  future changes in ownership as defined by internal revenue code sections and which may limit realization of certain assets  changes in forecasts of pre tax profits and losses by jurisdiction used to estimate tax expense by jurisdiction  assessment of additional taxes as a result of federal  state  or foreign tax examinations  or changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws 
our success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology standards of the semiconductor industry 
if we are unable to keep pace with rapidly changing technology standards  our products could be rendered obsolete  which would cause our operating results to decline 
the semiconductor industry has made significant technological advances 
in particular  recent advances in deep sub micron technology have required electronic design automation companies to continuously develop or acquire new products and enhance existing products 
the evolving nature of our industry could render our existing products and services obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to enhance our existing products and services  develop and introduce new products and services on a timely and cost effective basis that will keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards  address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers  and acquire other companies that have complementary or innovative products 
if we are unable  for technical  legal  financial or other reasons  to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
if we fail to offer and maintain competitive stock option packages for our employees  or if our stock price declines materially for a protracted period of time  we might have difficulty retaining our employees and our business may be harmed 
in today s competitive technology industry  employment decisions of highly skilled personnel are influenced by stock option packages  which offer incentives above traditional compensation only where there is a consistent  long term upward trend over time of a company s stock price 
our stock price has declined significantly over the past several years due to market conditions and has recently been negatively affected by uncertainty surrounding the outcome of our patent litigation with synopsys  inc discussed above under item  legal proceedings 
as a result  many of the options held by our employees have an exercise price significantly above the current trading price of our stock  on april  approximately of the options held by our non executive employees were underwater 

table of contents on april   our board of directors authorized us to seek stockholder approval of a stock option exchange program which  if approved by stockholders  will allow employees holding options to purchase our common stock at exercise prices greater than or equal to to exchange those options for a smaller number of new options at an exercise price equal to fair market value on the date of grant  which is expected to be in august we are seeking stockholder approval of the program at a special meeting of stockholders set for june  if our stockholders do not approve the stock option exchange program  our ability to retain employees could be affected 
if our stock price continues to decline in the future due to market conditions  investors perceptions of the technology industry or managerial or performance problems we have  we may be forced to grant additional options to retain employees 
this in turn could result in immediate and substantial dilution to investors resulting from the grant of additional options necessary to retain employees  and compensation charges against the company  which would negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  the new accounting requirements for employee stock options discussed below may adversely affect our option grant practices and our ability to recruit and retain employees 
when the accounting treatment for employee stock options changes  our reported results of operations will likely be adversely affected and we may be forced to change our employee compensation and benefits practices 
we currently account for the issuance of employee stock options under principles that do not require us to record compensation expense for options granted at fair market value 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
under sfas r  companies are required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we will be required to adopt the new rules no later than the first quarter of our fiscal year we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas r on our business practices  however  this change in accounting treatment will likely adversely affect our reported results of operations and hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
accordingly  we may consider changing our employee compensation practices  and those changes could make it harder for us to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates 
if our sales force compensation arrangements are not designed effectively  we may lose sales personnel and resources 
designing an effective incentive compensation structure for our sales force is critical to our success 
we have experimented  and continue to experiment  with different systems of sales force compensation 
if our incentives are not well designed  we may experience reduced revenue generation  and we may also lose the services of our more productive sales personnel  either of which would reduce our revenue or potential revenue 
fluctuations in our growth place a strain on our management systems and resources  and if we fail to manage the pace of our growth our business could be harmed 
periods of growth followed by efforts to realign costs when revenue growth is slower than anticipated have placed a strain on our management  administrative and financial resources 
for example  in fiscal year and the third quarter of fiscal year  we decreased our workforce by and employees  respectively 
over time we have significantly expanded our operations in the united states and internationally  and we plan to continue to expand the geographic scope of our operations 
to pace the growth of our operations with the growth in our revenue  we must continue to improve administrative  financial and operations systems  procedures and controls 
failure to improve our internal procedures and controls could result in a disruption of our operations and harm to our business 
we expect to incur a significant amount of consulting and other fees and expenses to 
table of contents document and enhance our financial processes and accounting controls and capabilities in order to achieve certification under section of the sarbanes oxley act of if we are unable to manage our growth the execution of our business plan could be delayed 
if chip designers and manufacturers do not integrate our software into existing design flows  or if other software companies do not cooperate in working with us to interface our products with their design flows  demand for our products may decrease 
to implement our business strategy successfully  we must provide products that interface with the software of other electronic design automation software companies 
our competitors may not support our or our customers efforts to integrate our products into their existing design flows 
we must develop cooperative relationships with competitors so that they will work with us to integrate our software into a customer s design flow 
currently  our software is designed to interface with the existing software of cadence  synopsys and others 
if we are unable to convince customers to adopt our software products instead of those of competitors offering a broader set of products  or if we are unable to convince other software companies to work with us to interface our software with theirs to meet the demands of chip designers and manufacturers  our business and operating results will suffer 
we may not obtain sufficient patent protection  which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses 
our success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology 
we currently have a number of issued patents in the united states  but this number is relatively few in relation to our competitors 
these legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology 
in addition  rights that may be granted under any patent application that may issue in the future may not provide competitive advantages to us 
further  patent protection in foreign jurisdictions where we may need this protection may be limited or unavailable 
it is possible that our pending us and us patents may not be issued  competitors may design around our present or future issued patents or may develop competing non infringing technologies  present and future issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights  and present and future issued patents could be successfully challenged for validity and enforceability 
we believe the patent portfolios of our competitors are far larger than ours  and this may increase the risk that they may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross licenses 
we rely on trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights  and if these rights are not sufficiently protected  it could harm our ability to compete and generate income 
to establish and protect our proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses 
our ability to compete and grow our business could suffer if these rights are not adequately protected 
we seek to protect our source code for our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
we license our software pursuant to agreements  which impose certain restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software 
we also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements 
our proprietary rights may not be adequately protected because laws and contractual restrictions in us and foreign jurisdictions may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  
table of contents competitors may independently develop similar technologies and software code  for some of our trademarks  federal us trademark protection may be unavailable to us  our trademarks may not be protected or protectable in some foreign jurisdictions  the validity and scope of our us and foreign trademarks could be successfully challenged  and policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use 
the laws of some countries in which we market our products may offer little or no protection of our proprietary technologies 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us for it  which would harm our competitive position and market share 
our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders own a substantial portion of our common stock and this concentration of ownership may allow them to elect most of our directors and could delay or prevent a change in control of magma 
our directors  executive officers and stockholders who currently own over of our common stock beneficially own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  in a combined vote  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval 
for example  they may be able to elect most of our directors  delay or prevent a transaction in which stockholders might receive a premium over the market price for their shares or prevent changes in control or management 
our stock price may decline significantly because of stock market fluctuations that affect the prices of technology stocks 
a decline in our stock price could result in securities class action litigation against us  which could divert management s attention and harm our business 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have adversely affected the market prices of common stock of technology companies 
these broad market fluctuations may reduce the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after periods of volatility in the market price of securities 
we may in the future be a target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our ability to execute our business plan 
we may need additional capital in the future  but there is no assurance that funds would be available on acceptable terms 
in the future we may need to raise additional capital in order to achieve growth or other business objectives 
this financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to expand  develop or enhance services or products  or respond to competitive pressures would be limited 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware corporate law contain anti takeover provisions which could delay or prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we could also adopt a stockholder rights plan  which could also delay or prevent a change in control 
delaware law  as well as our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  contain anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company  even if the change of control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
these provisions could lower the price that future investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
these anti takeover provisions authorize the board of directors without prior stockholder approval to create and issue preferred stock that can be issued increasing the number of outstanding shares and deter or prevent a takeover attempt  
table of contents prohibit stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  establish a classified board of directors requiring that not all members of the board be elected at one time  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  and require advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and proposals that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law and the terms of our stock option plans may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
that section generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the date the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
also  our stock option plans include change in control provisions that allow us to grant options or stock purchase rights that will become vested immediately upon a change in control of us 
the board of directors also has the power to adopt a stockholder rights plan  which could delay or prevent a change in control even if the change in control appeared to be beneficial to stockholders 
these plans  sometimes called poison pills  are sometimes criticized by institutional investors or their advisors and could affect our rating by such investors or advisors 
if the board were to adopt such a plan it might have the effect of reducing the price that new investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
we are subject to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we transact some portions of our business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to operating expenses in the united kingdom  europe and japan  which are denominated in the respective local currencies 
as of march   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
we do not currently use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses denominated in euro  british pounds and japanese yen 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
the convertible notes we issued in may are debt obligations that must be repaid in cash in may if they are not converted into our common stock at an earlier date  which is unlikely to occur if the price of our common stock does not exceed the conversion price 
in may  we issued million principal amount of our zero coupon convertible notes due may in early may  we repurchased  in privately negotiated transactions  million face amount or approximately percent of the total of these notes at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
magma spent an aggregate of approximately million on the repurchases 
the repurchase leaves approximately million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
we will be required to repay that principal amount in full in may unless the holders of those notes elect to convert them into our common stock before the repayment date 
the conversion price of the notes is per share 
if the price of our common stock does not rise above that level  conversion of the notes is unlikely and we would be required to repay the principal amount of the notes in cash 
there have been previous quarters in which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
because the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  volatility or depressed prices for our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of the notes 

table of contents hedging transactions and other transactions may affect the value of our common stock and our convertible notes 
we entered into hedging arrangements with credit suisse first boston international at the time we issued our convertible notes  with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing common stock upon conversion of the notes 
at the time of our may repurchase of our zero coupon convertible notes  a portion of the hedging arrangements were retired 
these hedging arrangements are likely to have caused credit suisse first boston international and others to take positions in our common stock in secondary market transactions or to enter into derivative transactions at or after the sale of the notes 
any market participants entering into hedging arrangements are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or other securities  which may increase the volatility and reduce the market price of our common stock 
our convertible notes are subordinated and there are no financial covenants in the indenture 
our convertible notes are general unsecured obligations of magma and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  which we may incur in the future 
in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization  or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events  our assets will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all senior indebtedness has been paid 
as a result  there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the outstanding notes 
in addition  we will not make any payments on the notes in the event of payment defaults or other specified defaults on our designated senior indebtedness 
neither we nor our subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture for the notes from incurring additional debt  including senior indebtedness 
if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt or other liabilities  our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be further adversely affected 
we expect that we and our subsidiaries from time to time will incur additional indebtedness and other liabilities 
we may be unable to meet the requirements under the indenture to purchase our convertible notes upon a change in control 
upon a change in control  which is defined in the indenture to include some cash acquisitions and private company mergers  note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes they hold 
if a change in control were to occur  we might not have enough funds to pay the purchase price for all tendered notes 
future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness might prohibit the redemption or repurchase of the notes and provide that a change in control constitutes an event of default 
if a change in control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing the notes  we could seek the consent of our lenders to purchase the notes or could attempt to refinance this debt 
if we do not obtain a consent  we could not purchase the notes 
our failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which might constitute a default under the terms of our other debt 
in such circumstances  or if a change in control would constitute an event of default under our senior indebtedness  the subordination provisions of the indenture would possibly limit or prohibit payments to note holders 
our obligation to offer to purchase the notes upon a change in control would not necessarily afford note holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  merger or similar transaction involving us 
failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by preventing us from transferring our technology outside of the united states 
we are required to comply with us department of commerce regulations when shipping our software products and or transferring our technology outside of the united states or to certain foreign nationals 
we believe we have complied with applicable export regulations  however  these regulations are subject to change  and  future difficulties in obtaining export licenses for current  future developed and acquired products and technology could harm our business  financial conditions and operating results 

table of contents our business operations may be adversely affected in the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster 
our corporate headquarters and much of our research and development operations are located in silicon valley  california  which is an area known for its seismic activity 
an earthquake  fire or other significant natural disaster could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term and long term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which mature within the next twenty four months 
as of march   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decline in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt  due to differences between market interest rates and rates in effect at the inception of our debt obligation 
changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt have no impact on our cash flows or consolidated financial statements 
credit risk we completed an offering on may  of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due may  concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our common stock  the exposure for which is held by credit suisse first boston international 
both the bond hedge and warrant transactions may be settled at our option either in cash or net shares and expire on may  the transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the notes 
subject to the movement in the share price of our common stock  we could be exposed to credit risk in the settlement of these options in our favor 
based on a review of the possible net settlements and the credit strength of credit suisse first boston international and its affiliates  we believe that we do not have a material exposure to credit risk arising from these option transactions 
in april  the company repurchased million face value of its convertible notes for million 
in doing so  the company liquidated investments that generated a realized loss of approximately million 
the company believes that it was in the best interests of the stockholders to reduce the balance sheet debt despite the one time loss resulting from the liquidation of marketable securities 
the company s investments that will mature in the next three to four months will be reinvested in short term instruments in order to take advantage of rising short term rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we transact some portions of our business in various foreign currencies  primarily related to a portion of revenue in japan and operating expenses in europe  japan and asia pacific 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of march   we had no currency hedging contracts outstanding 
we do not currently use financial instruments to hedge revenue and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis
