table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this overview is intended to provide a context for the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included in this annual report on form k 
we have attempted to identify the most important matters on which our management focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and the short term and long term opportunities  challenges and risks including material trends and uncertainties which we face 
we also discuss the actions we are taking to address these opportunities  challenges and risks 
the overview is not intended as a summary of  or a substitute for review of  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation business carpenter is engaged in the manufacturing  fabrication  and distribution of specialty metals and engineered products 
we primarily process basic raw materials such as chromium  nickel  titanium  iron scrap and other metal alloying elements through various melting  hot forming and cold working facilities to produce finished products in the form of billet  bar  rod  wire  narrow strip  special shapes  and hollow forms in many sizes and finishes 
we also produce certain metal powders and fabricated metal products 
in addition  ceramic products are produced from various raw materials using molding  heating and other processes 
our specialty metals segment includes the manufacturing and distribution of stainless steels  titanium  high temperature alloys  electronic alloys  tool steels and other alloys in billet  bar  wire  rod  strip and powder forms 
specialty metals sales are distributed directly from our production plants and distribution network as well as through independent distributors 
our engineered products segment includes the manufacture and sale of structural ceramic products  ceramic cores for the investment casting industry and custom shaped bar 
unlike many other specialty steel producers  we operate our own worldwide network of service distribution centers 
these service centers  located in the united states  canada  mexico and europe  allow us to work more closely with customers and to offer various just in time stocking programs 
as a result  we often serve as a technical partner in customizing specialty metals or developing new ones 
in an effort to increase revenue and profits  we have increased our presence in fast growing international markets 
in recent years  we have expanded our sales and marketing efforts in europe  asia  and north america 
our european headquarters are based in brussels  with our asian sales directed from singapore 
outside the united states  company owned distribution facilities are located in mexico  canada  the united kingdom and belgium 
in addition to the united states  where the majority of our manufacturing exists  we have manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom  mexico  sweden and australia 

table of contents we believe that our ability to be a product innovator in special material development and manufacturing is an important factor in the success of the company 
our strong commitment to setting new industry standards is evidenced by our specialty alloys research and development center  where teams work in such areas as physical metallurgy  analytical chemistry  materials characterization and process and systems development 
we also have highly skilled engineering teams specializing in specific products at each of our engineered products operations 
business trends net sales and earnings for the past three fiscal years are summarized below in millions  except per share data net sales net income loss diluted earnings loss per share our results of operations have improved significantly over the past two fiscal years largely as a result of implementation of our business strategies and favorable market conditions  especially in the aerospace  industrial  automotive and medical supply markets 
the key components of our business strategies are as follows a shift in product mix to higher value materials  improved margins from an intentional reduction in the sale of marginally profitable products  a focus on selling unique products in niche markets to customers who value product performance and services  expansion of sales in markets outside of the us  efforts to achieve operational excellence through our focus on lean and variation reduction 
specifically  we use the phrase lean and variation reduction to refer to eliminating or reducing non value added activities  process variation reduction  process control  work concentration  product flow based on specific customer quantity demand and constraint removal 
our lean and variation reduction philosophy applies to all aspects of our business  including product development  order taking and scheduling  manufacturing  logistics and administrative processes 
increases in the cost of raw materials have impacted our operations over the past few years 
we  and others in our industry  generally have been able to pass these cost increases through to our customers using surcharges 
these surcharges have had an impact on our sales numbers and our gross profit percentages as described later in this discussion 
the amount of net pension expense or income has varied significantly over the past three years and may continue to do so in the future 
the net pension expense is actuarially determined at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon the value of the assets in the pension trusts as well as actuarial assumptions  such as the discount rate used to value future 
table of contents liabilities and anticipated performance of investments 
volatility in long term interest rates and investment performance has resulted in changes in net pension expense 
the impacts on the past three years are described in the discussions below 
based on actuarial calculations done at june   net pension expense for fiscal will be approximately million 
this increase over the fiscal million net pension expense is due primarily to a reduction in the discount rate assumption from to 
business risks we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
among these risks and uncertainties are the following the cyclical nature of the specialty materials business and certain end use markets  including aerospace  power generation  automotive  industrial and consumer  or other influences on our business such as new competitors  the consolidation of customers and suppliers or the transfer of manufacturing capacity from the united states to foreign countries  our ability to achieve cost savings  productivity improvements or process changes  the ability to recoup increases in raw materials  the cost of energy or other factors  domestic and foreign excess manufacturing capacity for certain metals  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the degree of success of government trade actions  the potential that our customers may substitute alternate materials or adopt different manufacturing practices that replace or limit the suitability of our products  the valuation of the assets and liabilities in our pension trusts 
special items recorded in fiscal years  and during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million before taxes on the sale of our subsidiary  carpenter special products corporation cspc 
the divestiture was part of the company s strategy to focus on its specialty material businesses 
cspc had sales of less than million in fiscal and accounted for less than percent of consolidated operating income 
in fiscal  we incurred a loss on the early retirement of debt of million before taxes 
this loss was a result of a million open market purchase of certain medium term notes previously issued by the company and the termination of interest rate swaps associated with the partial repayment of foreign currency loans 
during fiscal  we incurred charges of million before taxes related to restructuring and other costs 
these charges represented the cost of actions taken as part of our strategy to reduce costs and improve operational effectiveness 
also  during we incurred a loss on early retirement of debt of million resulting from the early redemption of debt
