fiscal year was a week period and fiscal years and were week periods 
net revenues increased for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  the increase in sales was due to growth in all business categories 
we expect future sales growth to be driven primarily by the retail and foodservice areas 
we experienced a decline in net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in net revenues during fiscal year was attributable to declines in sales to retail  airline and foodservice customers 
our gross profit increased during fiscal year and during fiscal year operating income increased for the fiscal year ended october  and for the fiscal year ended september  due to increases in sales  better leveraging of manufacturing overhead and reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
cost of sales declined as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year and in fiscal year sg a as a percentage of net revenues improved to in fiscal year from in fiscal year and in fiscal year results of operations the tables presented below  which compare our results of operations from one period to another  present the results for each period  the change in those results from one period to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each period as a percentage of net revenues

net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  increased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  retail net revenues increased  to  for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  this increase was attributable to higher sales to large national brand customers as well as to an existing club store customer 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  sales to a national retail brand customer declined by  due to a discontinued product line 
we expect to replace this lost revenue with sales to a newly acquired account beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year another national retail brand customer shifted production of certain items from our facility to the customer s own manufacturing facility  causing a  decline in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we expect to begin sales of a new product line to the same customer in the first quarter of fiscal  which we anticipate will replace the lost sales to this customer 
foodservice net revenues increased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  the growth was largely due to increased sales to an existing customer 
airline net revenues were  for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of  
the increase generated from the addition of new airline customers and improvements in air travel from early fiscal year levels were partially offset by a large airline carrier s decision to offer meals on only long haul and international flights 
future airline sales may be affected by the financial difficulties of airline customers including the bankruptcy filings of delta airlines and northwest airlines 
we expect sales growth to continue in the retail and foodservice categories 
we also believe airline meals will continue to be a profitable part of our overall business despite the financial stresses facing the airline industry 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended october  increased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  the majority of this increase is attributable to net revenues increasing  the balance of the increase was the result of improvement in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues to for the fiscal year ended october  from for the fiscal year ended september  margin improvement was attributable to better leveraging of manufacturing overhead costs which represented  and  or or of sales in fiscal years and  respectively and efficiencies due to the plant consolidation and better pricing of raw materials 
we modified our estimate for recording inventory reserves during the first quarter of fiscal year to apply estimated reserve percentages to aging categories 
the impact of this change in estimate resulted in a one time increase to cost of sales and decrease in gross profit of approximately  or a decline in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a for the fiscal year ended october  decreased  to  of net revenues from  of net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  demonstration and promotional expenses have declined from previous levels as a result of a decline in sales to a customer who required us to pay a portion of those costs 
these declines were offset by  of costs associated with our exploration of strategic financial alternatives to improve stockholder value  increases in insurance costs and approximately  in provision for bad debt related to the write off of delta airlines receivables 
barring changes in our sales mix  we expect spending on demonstrations and promotions to continue at the current level 
operating income 
operating income increased  to  for the fiscal year ended october  from  for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in operating income was the result of improvements in sales  gross margins and sg a as noted above 
other expenses 
other expenses for the fiscal year ended october   which consisted primarily of various financing related charges  decreased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease was attributable to savings realized from the debt refinancing discussed below 
in particular  amortization of deferred financing costs decreased  
additionally  interest expense declined  due to the early pay off of the term b loan on june  we expect some interest expense savings in future periods as we seek to refinance our debt in fiscal year and believe this can be done at lower interest rates 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful  or that interest rates on the new debt will be lower than on existing facilities 
additionally  we continued voluntary principal payments on the term a loan  reducing our outstanding debt balance 
included in other expenses for the fiscal year ended september  was a charge of  primarily non cash for debt extinguishment expenses related to the write off of deferred financing costs and debt issue costs in connection with the october refinancing discussed below 
during fiscal year we recorded a  valuation allowance against a portion of our deferred tax assets  since at that time it was believed that such assets did not meet the more likely than not criteria to be recoverable through projected future profitable operations in the foreseeable future 
however  in fiscal year  as a result of improved operating results  we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  we reversed  of the previously recorded valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we would record our adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a charge to income at that time 
net income loss 
the net result for the fiscal year ended october  was net income of  or per basic share and per diluted share as compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the fiscal year ended september  we currently expect to continue profitable operations primarily through a growing revenues from profitable product lines and increasing our customer base  b improving gross margins by streamlining additional costs and continuing to leverage the manufacturing and storage facilities to improve manufacturing efficiency  c adding higher margin products and d reducing future interest costs on outstanding debt through a future refinancing which we believe can be done at lower interest rates 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful  or that interest rates on the new debt will be lower than on existing facilities 
as discussed in risk factors contained in item a of this report  we may be unable to improve our operating results if we suffer a decline in our manufacturing efficiency  the loss of major customers  declines in air travel  adverse changes in our operating costs or raw materials costs or other adverse changes to our business

net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  retail sales declined  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september   attributable to a decrease of market sales by one of our retail customers 
airline net revenues were  for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of  the decline in airline sales of in the first half of the fiscal year ended september  compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year was largely due to the impact of the events of september  and was almost entirely offset by improvements in air travel and the addition of new airline customers in the second half of the fiscal year ended september  foodservice net revenues were  for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit 
despite lower revenues  gross profit for the fiscal year ended september  increased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  margin improvement was attributable to our plant consolidation  specifically  reductions in operating supplies  rent expense  interplant freight and outside storage costs which resulted in a  or  decline in cost of sales for the fiscal year ended september  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  to  of net revenues from  of net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in sg a for the fiscal year resulted primarily from reductions in salaries  the reduced requirement for point of sale product demonstration and promotional activity and decreases in the provision for bad debts 
operating income 
operating income increased  to  for the fiscal year ended september  from  for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in operating income was the result of improvements in gross margin and sg a as noted above 
other expenses 
other expenses for the fiscal year ended september   which consisted primarily of various financing related charges  decreased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  this decrease is due to a  decline in amortization of deferred financing costs to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the amortization expense for fiscal year included the amortization of costs related to previous financing arrangements 
additionally  interest expense decreased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  all remaining costs associated with previous financing arrangements were written off as debt extinguishment expense as part of the october refinancing 
approximately  of the decline in other expenses was attributable to accruals recorded in estimated for the cost of refurbishing the san diego facility  which was vacated upon expiration of the lease 
net loss 
the net result for the fiscal year ended september  was a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share as compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the fiscal year ended september  liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash balances and additional financing capacity 
our cash and cash equivalents increased  to  as of october  from  at september  during the fiscal year ended october   our operating activities resulted in a source of cash of  as compared to a use of cash of  during fiscal year cash generated from operations before working capital changes was  sources of cash in fiscal year resulted primarily from a  decline in inventory  a  reduction in prepaid expenses and a  decrease in accounts receivable  offset by a decline in accounts payable of  as of october   we had working capital of  during the fiscal year ended october   our investing activities  comprised of capital expenditures  resulted in a net use of cash of approximately  as compared to a net use of cash of approximately  during fiscal year current year additions to property and equipment relate to the purchase of new machinery to automate certain manufacturing processes 
capital expenditures for additional capacity  should they prove to be necessary to meet additional customer demand  may increase during fiscal year by million to million  depending on the amount of additional cooking capacity added 
capital expenditures will be funded by cash generated from operating activities 
during the fiscal year ended october   our financing activities resulted in a use of cash of approximately  as compared to cash provided of  during fiscal year the use of cash in fiscal year consisted of voluntary prepayments on our term a and term b loans and scheduled principal payments on our long term debt 
the term b loan in the principal amount of million with an interest of libor plus  was paid off as of june   in advance of the january  maturity date 
the cash provided in fiscal year resulted primarily from new borrowings  net of related deferred financing costs  in connection with the october debt financing discussed below  offset by principal payments during the fiscal year on our long term debt 
as of october   our indebtedness to significant lenders consisted substantially of debt evidenced by a secured senior subordinated note payable to llcp with principal balance of million and a senior term a note payable to psi  an affiliate of llcp  with a principal balance of million 
both notes have a maturity date of october  the senior subordinated note has a base rate of interest of  subject to increase upon the occurrence of an interest rate event  as defined  or event of default 
the interest rate on the term a loan  as amended  is plus the prime rate in effect from time to time and is subject to increase upon the occurrence of any interest rate event  as defined  or event of default as provided in the note that evidences the loan 
from time to time  we have obtained amendments to the financing agreements to enable us to remain in compliance with financial and or non financial covenants 
on september   we executed the fifth amendment to the existing financing arrangements with psi and llcp to amend the financial covenants and various other provisions 
in the september  amendments  we agreed to make five scheduled installment principal payments totaling million on the term a loan commencing on the effective date of the amendment through december  the amendments also amended certain definitions of the financial covenants of the secured senior subordinated note 
the amended and restated securities purchase agreement with llcp and the amended and restated loan and security agreement with psi  which have been amended from time to time  contain various covenants  including financial covenants covering restrictions on capital expenditures  minimum ebitda and net worth levels  and specified debt service and debt to equity ratios 
in addition  those agreements prohibit changes in control  including ownership and certain management personnel  and contain customary restrictions on incurring indebtedness and liens  making investments  paying dividends and making loans or advances 
the obligations owing by us to psi and llcp are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets 
we believe that we will be in compliance with all of our revised financial and other covenant requirements for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  based upon anticipated covenant compliance and as a result of the refinancing of the obligations described above  all principal amounts payable to llcp and to psi  other than currently scheduled principal payments  have been classified as long term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet as of october  in the future  our failure to achieve certain revenue  expense and profitability levels could result in a violation of the amended financial covenants under our financing arrangements and could result in interest rate increases and acceleration of maturity of the loans  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we believe that funds available to us from operations  existing capital resources and an anticipated refinancing of our debt that matures in october will be adequate for our capital requirements for at the least the next twelve months 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate sufficient funds from operations or that we will successfully refinance our debt

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which  under most circumstances  requires retrospective application of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
also requires the restatement of previously issued financial statements when reporting the correction of an error 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r will require us to measure the cost of all employee stock based compensation awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award generally over the vesting period of the award 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r in the fiscal quarter ending january  we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
there were no operating cash flows in prior periods from share based payments 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp clarifies that the manufacturer s deduction provided for under the american jobs creation act of the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
and not as a tax rate reduction 
the adoption of fsp had no impact on our results of operations or financial position for fiscal year  as the manufacturer s deduction is not available to us until fiscal year we are currently evaluating the effect that the manufacturer s deduction will have in subsequent years 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no

 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas no

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are related to its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
a bankruptcy or other significant financial deterioration of any customers could impact their future ability to satisfy their receivables with us 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based primarily upon historical bad debt experience and current market conditions 
until fiscal  bad debt expense and accounts receivable write offs  net of recoveries  historically were immaterial as we generally transact the substantial portion of our business with large  established food or service related businesses 
for the fiscal years ended october   september  and september   our write offs  net of recoveries  to the allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately   and  respectively 
a significant portion of our total net revenues during the last two fiscal years was derived from two customers 
panda restaurant group  inc and jenny craig  inc accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues for the fiscal year ended october  and approximately and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable balance at october  panda restaurant group  inc and jenny craig  inc 
accounted for approximately and respectively  of our revenues for the fiscal year ended september  and approximately and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable balance at september  we continue to expand our retail and foodservice customer base with the goal of reducing our reliance on a small concentration of accounts 
inventories 
inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been materially consistent with actual costs 
we determine the market value of our raw ingredients  finished product and packaging inventories based upon references to current market prices for such items as of the end of each reporting period and record a write down of inventory standard cost to market  when applicable 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and we establish a valuation reserve based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
a reserve is established for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products  and discontinued inventory items and components 
the amount of the reserve is determined by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information  and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in materially different amounts for this item 
during the quarter ended january   we revised our method to apply reserve estimation percentages to aging categories 
the effect of this change in estimate resulted in one time higher cost of sales and lower gross profit of approximately  and lowered net income by approximately  for the three months ended january  excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired 
we evaluate the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we have one reporting unit and estimate fair value based on a variety of market factors  including discounted cash flow analysis  market capitalization  and other market based data 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded during fiscal year at october   we had goodwill of million 
a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect could decrease the estimated fair value of our business and  thus  cause our goodwill to become impaired and cause us to record a charge against operations in an amount representing the impairment 
income taxes 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
during fiscal year we recorded a  valuation allowance against a portion of our deferred tax assets  since at that time it was believed that such assets did not meet the more likely than not criteria to be recoverable through projected future profitable operations in the foreseeable future 
however  in fiscal year  as a result of improved operating results  we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  we reversed  of the previously recorded valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we would record our adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a charge to income  at that time
