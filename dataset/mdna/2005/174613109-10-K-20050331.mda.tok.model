segment profit loss the company manages its operations in five business segments  home service life  broker life  preneed life  dental  and other health 
products in all five segments are sold through independent agency operations 
home service life consists primarily of traditional life insurance coverage sold in amounts of  and under to middle and lower income individuals 
this distribution channel is characterized by a significant amount of agent contact with customers throughout the year 
broker life product sales consist primarily of simplified issue and graded benefit policies in amounts of  and under 
other products in the broker life segment that comprise a significant portion of existing business include group life  universal life  annuities and participating life policies 
preneed life products are sold to individuals in connection with prearrangement of their funeral and include single and multi pay policies  generally in amounts of  and less 
these policies are generally sold to middle aged and elderly individuals at increased premium rates 
dental products are term policies generally sold to small and intermediate size employer groups 
other health products include various accident and health policies sold to individuals and employer groups 
profit or loss for each segment is reported on a pretax basis  without an allocation of realized investment gains or interest expense 
the company s segment loss was  compared to  in and  in the segment losses in and excluding nonrecurring items described below was  and  respectively 
the nonrecurring items in and include costs of  settlement and legal costs incurred in associated with the legal proceedings described in item  and additional one time consulting expenses  in and  in related to redesign and other organizational restructuring begun in  as well as severance agreements 
although the company s segment loss of  excluding nonrecurring items was comparable to the loss of  operating result comparisons between years included unfavorable results related to a a decrease in premiums and other considerations of  pre need premium decreased  while dental premium increased  and premium for other segments experienced modest decreases  b a decrease in net deferral of policy acquisition costs and amortization of value of insurance in force of  offset by c a decrease in policyholder benefits and commissions totaling  and d an increase of  in investment income 
see pages through of management discussion and analysis for a more extensive analysis of factors impacting the individual segment operating results between years 
net income the company s net income was  compared to a net income of  in and net loss of  in these results reflect the segment losses described above including nonrecurring items and net realized gains losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
the company realized significant increases in realized capital gains in both and due to restructuring the investment portfolio to include a greater proportion of fixed maturity investments and fewer equity investments while taking advantage of an upturn in the equities market 
comprehensive gains and losses comprehensive gains and losses which combine net gains and losses and net unrealized gains and losses were   and  for   and  respectively 
during  the company continued to be adversely affected by relatively low yields on its fixed income investment portfolio 
comprehensive losses were attributable to the decrease in net income of  described above and a change in unrealized gains losses of 
late in the second quarter of  interest yields on fixed maturity investments began to rise 
although this adversely impacts the market value of the company s bond portfolio  the opportunity to invest new money at higher yields would have a positive impact on the company s operating earnings 
the environment as described continues to generate a relatively high level of qualitative investment risk  as discussed in the cash flow and liquidity section 
the majority of the and declines in net income and the comprehensive losses were attributable to adverse securities markets during those years  including the effects of declines in the telecommunications and technology sectors  a general economic recession and terrorist events 
the company repurchased   and  shares of its common stock during  and respectively  at average prices of  and per share  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to investments  agent receivables  intangible assets  policy liabilities  income taxes  regulatory requirements  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following accounting policies  judgments and estimates  which have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors  critically impact preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
investment in debt and equity securities 
the company holds debt and equity interests in a variety of companies  many of which are seeking to exploit recent technology advancements 
the majority of these are publicly traded and many have experienced volatile market prices 
company management periodically evaluates whether the declines in fair value of investments are other than temporary 
these evaluations involve significant judgment 
the evaluations consist of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors  including analysis of the company s competitive position in its markets  deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  downgrades of the security by a rating agency  and other publicly available issuer specific news or general market conditions 
declines in fair values of securities deemed to be temporary and which the company has the ability and intent to hold until recovery are included as an unrealized loss in shareholders equity 
declines in fair values of securities deemed to be other than temporary are included in net income as realized investment losses 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred acquisition costs dac 
the company is required to defer certain policy acquisition costs and amortize them over future periods 
these costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are primarily associated with acquiring new business 
the deferred costs are recorded as an asset commonly referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
the dac asset balance is subsequently charged to income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated emergence of revenue or profits 
actual revenue or profits can vary from company estimates  resulting in an increase or decrease in the rate of amortization 
the company regularly evaluates its dac balances to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
assumptions considered significant include surrender and lapse rates  mortality  expense levels  investment performance  and estimated interest spread 
should actual experience dictate that the company change its assumptions regarding the emergence of future revenues or profits commonly referred to as unlocking  the company would record a charge or credit to bring its dac balance to the level it would have been if using the new assumptions from the inception date of each policy 
dac is also subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing 
these tests ensure that the present value of future contract related cash flows will support the capitalized dac balance to be amortized in the future 
the present value of these cash flows  less the benefit reserve  is compared with the unamortized dac balance and if the dac balance is greater  the deficiency is charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced to the recoverable amount 
for more information about accounting for dac see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible impairment 
the balance of the company s goodwill and value of insurance acquired vif was million at december  the recovery of these assets is dependent on the fair value of the business to which they relate 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
 goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests based on the estimated fair value of the respective assets 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of these assets 
different valuation methods and assumptions can produce significantly different results that could affect the amount of any potential impairment charge that might be required to be recognized 
during both and  the company concluded that no impairment adjustment was necessary for its goodwill or vif 
policy liabilities and policy intangible assets 
establishing policy liabilities for the company s long duration insurance contracts requires making many assumptions  including policyholder persistency  mortality rates  investment yields  discretionary benefit increases  new business pricing  and operating expense levels 
the company evaluates historical experience for these factors when assessing the need for changing current assumptions 
however  since many of these factors are interdependent and subject to short term volatility during the long duration contract period  substantial estimates and judgment are required 
accordingly  if actual experience emerges differently from that assumed  any such difference would be recognized in the current year s consolidated statement of operations 
deferred taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  the company has not assumed future taxable income 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
litigation 
as further described in item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  united liberty has been a party to an outstanding lawsuit concerning payment of policyholder dividends 
the parties have reached a provisional settlement agreement dated october  as described in item and note  the company has recorded the financial impact of the agreement as of december  financial position assets 
at december   the company s available for sale fixed maturities had a fair value of  and amortized cost of  the company s fixed maturities portfolio increased approximately during and during  on an amortized cost basis

the company believes it has a well diversified portfolio and has no plans to adjust its non investment grade portfolio significantly  unless necessary to satisfy requirements of state regulators or rating agencies 
the company purchases non investment grade bonds to obtain higher yields or convertible features and attempts to reduce credit risk by portfolio diversification 
non investment grade securities comprised and of the fixed maturities portfolio  on an amortized cost basis  at december  and  respectively 
during  the company recognized approximately  of impairment losses on fixed maturities related to the airline industry 
the company reviews its fixed maturity portfolio quarterly for impairment losses which might be other than temporary losses and recognizes all such losses in the quarter they are deemed other than temporary 
realized investment losses included   and  of pretax impairment losses for the three years ended december   and the impairments recorded were the result of the continued credit deterioration of specific issuers in the bond and equity markets  especially in the airline and telecommunications industries 
shown below are the company s four largest holdings in non investment grade bonds by a single issuer as of december  non investment grade december  amortized cost fair value largest second largest third largest fourth largest total the company had no guarantee or other type of enhancement associated with the issuers represented above 
during  the company s investment in equity securities decreased  and  on a cost and fair value basis  after increasing  and  on a cost and fair value basis  respectively  during as of december   and  there were   and  respectively  of unrealized gains on equity securities 
the company reviews its marketable investments each quarter to determine if there have been declines in their value that in management s opinion are other than temporary 
these reviews can involve qualitative and quantitative information relating to an individual company or industry and general factors impacting the economy 
however  due to wide market fluctuations occurring during the past two years  determining whether declines are temporary has become much more complex and judgmental 
these reviews resulted in the recognition of impairment losses on equity securities totaling  during   and  for the first  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
in addition   of impairment losses were recognized on fixed maturities during  all in the third quarter 
during  equity securities were sold which contained impairment write downs of  and fixed maturities were sold which contained impairment write downs of citizens security owns the building in which the company and its subsidiaries maintain their home offices 
they occupy approximately of the building with the balance leased to third party tenants 
market conditions for this property are generally favorable 
an updated appraisal obtained during indicates the market value of the property is approximately  higher than its carrying value 
at december  the company has recorded  of goodwill and  of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of insurance acquired 
as noted in the above discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates  these intangibles  and the recorded value of policy liabilities  are based on many assumptions that require substantial estimates and judgment 
in connection with adoption of sfas no 
 the company reassessed the assumptions supporting these values 
although no impairment was considered necessary  a continued historically low interest rate environment could require adjustment of these recorded values 
liabilities 
a comparison of total policy liabilities as of december   and is shown below 
approximately of the total consist of insurance policy benefit reserves while policyholder deposit liabilities represent of the total 
year ended december home service life broker life preneed life dental other health total home service life sales have decreased only moderately in recent years  with net growth in policy liabilities of in both and  through a combination of attracting new producers and continuing to focus on meeting the needs of existing customers and agents 
only modest changes were experienced in in the broker life segment 
preneed life premiums are lower  due in part to the company s decision to emphasize the lower annual premium multi pay policies rather than single pay policies and some loss of volume attributable to reducing commission levels and the rate of annual growth credited to policies 
the company is not currently focusing any marketing effort to this segment because of the adverse effects of the recent low interest rate environment 
during  dental premiums were favorably impacted by additional broker relationships and normal premium increases 
the other health segment products are not being actively marketed

off balance sheet arrangements the company does not participate in any off balance sheet arrangements 
consolidated results and analysis premiums and other considerations 
the following table details premiums and other considerations received during the past three fiscal years 
year ended december home service life broker life preneed life dental other health total home service life premium decreased modestly in both and new sales levels continue to be favorable  at levels that exceed normal policy lapses 
the company continues to attract a number of successful  experienced home service agents without subsidizing inexperienced agents 
in addition  the company s program to automate and streamline agent field accounting continues to expand with favorable reaction among the agency force 
to mitigate effects of the lower interest rate environment  during the second quarter of the company introduced premium rate increases on its home service products 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began to geographically expand the home service market  hiring two new regional representatives to recruit new agents in ohio and pennsylvania  as well as in florida and georgia 
the modest decreases in broker life premium during and resulted from reduction of business provided by certain larger brokers during and continuing pressure from the overall economic slowdown on middle and lower income consumers 
the company is evaluating opportunities for revising its product design and commission rates to counteract the softening in demand for its simplified issue and graded benefit life policies 
the company introduced a new final expense policy in january in an effort to strengthen the growth of this segment by better meeting the desires of our policyholders and agents 
the and decrease in preneed life premium during and  respectively  resulted from the company s modification of certain policy benefits and commissions which resulted in a loss in the number of producers and an intentional refocusing of marketing efforts toward segments that the company believes offer more positive potential in the current environment 
the and growth in dental premium during and  respectively  resulted primarily from a renewed effort to expand the company s presence in the dental marketplace 
during the past two years  new business production has become increasingly competitive as larger providers expand their marketing initiatives 
however  the company has historically maintained strong customer and agent loyalty by continuing to improve customer service  including sales and administrative support functions 
beginning in january the company is expanding its capacity to administer more dental business without increasing administration costs by replacing our group administration system with a current state of the art system 
the company has not been actively marketing other health policies for several years 
however  in response to agent requests  certain cancer and disability protection products have been updated and promoted 
pricing  underwriting  and claims experience on these products are closely monitored 
investments 
the company monitors its available for sale fixed maturities and equity securities to assure they are strategically positioned within the current market environment 
this practice has historically resulted in holding significant equity security positions  which tend to dampen current income yields in favor of an overall total return focus 
the company s equity securities comprised and of its total investment portfolios at december  and  respectively 
the company s investment income yields were   and for   and  respectively 
the yield decline resulted primarily from substantially lower interest rates on new investments  the company s net addition to its fixed maturity portfolio during the year and a increase in equity holdings  much of which is attributable to new preneed life business 
although the company s total return on investments has historically been very favorable  returns for the past three years have been severely impacted by declines in the airline  telecommunications and technology sectors  a general economic recession and the effect of terrorist events on the securities markets 
as detailed in the following table  net realized and unrealized investment gains totaled approximately  for the two years ended december   while net realized and unrealized losses totaled approximately  for the three years ended december  the company does not anticipate severe deterioration in the securities markets as experienced during the years through although there is still some volatility in the equities markets 
at december   the company s investment portfolios contain a net unrealized gain outstanding of  below is an approximate calculation of investment income yields and total return defined as yields including net investment income  net realized investment gains or losses and net change in the excess or deficit of market values over book values of the investment portfolios or unrealized gains losses yields for the five years ending december  year ended december  investment income gains and losses fixed maturities realized gains losses unrealized gains losses net fixed maturities equity securities realized gains losses unrealized gains losses net equity securities total gains and losses total return average cash and investments yield income yield total shareholders equity return segment earnings 
pretax profit loss is shown below for the company s five business segments  along with total net realized investment gains losses and interest expense 
year ended december segment profit loss home service life broker life preneed life dental other health segment totals net realized investment gains losses interest expense income loss before income tax the decrease in pretax income of  primarily results from a a decrease in premiums and other considerations of  or preneed premium decreased  or while dental premium increased  or and premium for other segments experienced modest decreases  b costs of  settlement and legal costs associated with the legal proceedings described in item  c a decrease in net deferral of policy acquisition costs and amortization of value of insurance in force of  d additional one time expenses related to consulting and severance of  offset by e a decrease in policyholder benefits and commissions totaling  f an increase of  in investment income and g an increase of  in net realized investment gains 
the decline in pretax segment profit in was primarily attributable to decreased preneed life premium and adverse mortality 
home service life in the home service life segment experienced lower investment income of  and increased expenses including net deferral of policy acquisition costs of  associated primarily with one time consulting costs  severance and legal costs  resulting in a decrease in segment profit of  broker life the  increase in the loss in the broker life segment is primarily the result of settlement and legal costs of  related to legal proceedings described in item  reduced investment income of  and a decrease in other expenses including net deferral of policy acquisition costs of  pre need life the reduced loss of  in compared to is the result of the efforts described below along with higher investment yields and lower expenses resulting from the reduced level of new business 
although the company is optimistic about improving profitability in this highly competitive market  if adverse profitability trends continue  several options are available 
these options  including further lowering discretionary annual benefit increases and adjusting premiums and commissions on new business  could further adversely impact the company s ability to compete for new business 
the preneed life increased loss compared to resulted from lower investment yields  unfavorable mortality  and increased expenses 
during  the company accepted a significant amount of single premium business  which generally has higher than average mortality rates 
in addition  significant management and marketing resources were devoted to this business 
to improve profitability  annual benefit growth rates were reduced in early and again in september also  twice during  certain commission rates were reduced and agent contracts revised to encourage production of the more profitable multi pay products 
dental information regarding dental profitability is included below 
the contribution margin shown below is a direct margin without allocable investment income and general expense 
year ended december premium claims and reserves contribution margin claim ratio the overall dental contribution margin decreased in by  due to adverse morbidity especially related to one large group and inadequate premium for groups renewing  after increasing slightly during due to improved claim levels 
also  the company has encountered more competition as additional insurers continue to expand in the dental market and dental providers continue to provide higher levels of care to patients 
the company is continuing its ongoing efforts to maintain profitability in this line by reconfiguring products to provide adequate margins for the various dental procedures  utilizing a third party company to provide expert assistance with ongoing adjudication of claims  and continuing its program of aggressive renewal underwriting and re rating 
a large group with a particularly high morbidity rate was not renewed in december other health the company has not devoted significant marketing effort toward its other health products in recent years 
however  during through  a significant increase in disability claims occurred  with a concentration in new jersey 
the company has strengthened underwriting practices in this area  has taken steps toward filing for a rate increase on its disability products  and has discontinued accepting applications for this policy in new jersey in the fall of income taxes 
historically  the company has experienced a relatively low effective current income tax rate  due primarily to the small life insurance company deduction  along with operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry forwards 
the effective expense benefit rate was approximately and in and  respectively 
the small life insurance company deduction allows the life insurance subsidiaries to reduce their taxable income by before computing their current provisions for regular or alternative minimum tax 
however  for purposes of computing deferred income tax liabilities under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company is precluded from assuming the small life insurance company deduction will be available in the future 
accordingly  by disallowing this deduction  sfas no 
significantly increases the deferred taxes on the life insurance subsidiaries temporary differences 
thus  when a significant increase or decrease occurs in the company s net temporary differences  the related deferred tax is computed using the federal tax rate  whereas tax may actually be paid on these net liabilities when realized at a rate potentially as low as the alternative minimum tax rate after application of the allowable small life insurance company deduction 
the company s gross deferred federal income tax liabilities and assets are more fully discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the gross deferred tax assets are offset  to some extent  by valuation allowances related to the company and to the life insurance subsidiaries and then offset against existing deferred tax liabilities 
the company s valuation allowance is designed to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated ultimate realization value 
statutory insurance information 
for insurance regulatory and rating purposes  the insurance subsidiaries report on the basis of statutory accounting principles sap 
in recent years  various state insurance departments and the naic have expressed concern  essentially about the rate of return earned by holders of small face amount life policies  potentially including preneed policies 
although the company does not believe calculating a simple rate of return or premium pay back measure is meaningful for traditional life insurance products  certain state insurance regulators are considering actions that could alter the profitability of existing contracts or eliminate small face amount policies as a viable product offering 
during december  citizens financial strengthened the statutory capital position of citizens security by acquiring  of citizens security redeemable preferred stock 
during january  citizens financial contributed of the capital stock of citizens insurance to citizens security 
the statutory value of this contribution was  citizens security has reported its investments in united liberty and citizens insurance on the equity method of accounting  since their acquisition in and  respectively 
however  beginning in  new rules changed the statutory equity method of accounting to preclude a parent insurer from recording as income  its share of undistributed subsidiary earnings 
for   and  citizens security reported as income the   and  respectively  of dividend distributions that it received from united liberty and citizens insurance 
at december   citizens security reported its investments in united liberty and citizens insurance at their statutory equity values of  and  respectively

the through amounts also include united liberty s asset valuation reserves 
citizens insurance does not have an asset valuation reserve

citizens insurance generated statutory net income in both and of  and paid dividends of  and  to citizens security in and  respectively 
united liberty generated statutory net income loss of approximately     and  during    and  respectively and remitted dividends to its parent of  and  in and  respectively 
statutory capital and surplus  specifically the component called surplus  is used to fund the expansion of an insurance company s first year individual life and accident and health sales 
the first year commission and underwriting expenses on such sales will often exceed first year premiums 
accordingly  a statutory loss surplus strain often occurs on these sales during the first policy year 
historically  the company s level of life insurance sales has not significantly impacted statutory surplus 
the company has completed a strategic review of its products and operations 
a key element of this initiative is mitigating the significant losses incurred on the preneed life business segment and strengthening future profitability in the broker life  home service life and dental segments by increasing premiums  strengthening underwriting policies  modifying commissions  and where possible  lowering interest crediting or policy growth rates 
cash flow and liquidity due to losses in and and the adverse impact of the low interest rate environment on operating results  during the company borrowed  from its chairman to strengthen the statutory capital position of citizens security 
the company borrowed an additional  from its chairman in for general operating capital 
the borrowings from the company s chairman are considered current debt as a result of a day call provision in the loan agreement 
the company also has  of commercial bank debt outstanding  with scheduled repayments due through during  and the company did not comply with a loan covenant debt to earnings ratio on this debt and received a series of waivers of such violation through december  in return for the waivers the company s chairman agreed to personally guarantee the outstanding bank debt 
however  since the company is not assured of meeting this covenant throughout  the full balance of  can be considered payable within one year 
although the company does not expect the full balance to be called during  it believes such an obligation could be met through a refinancing arrangement or sale of selected assets or a block of insurance business 
regarding the currently scheduled debt repayments  the company believes its available funds will be adequate to service debt obligations 
in addition  the company s chairman has expressed potential willingness to loan the company an additional  if necessary  which could service debt obligations through additional information regarding debt obligations is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a summary of all known commitments of the company as of december   including the aforementioned borrowings  is as follows contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years after years note payable to bank note payable to related party operating leases management is not aware of any other commitments or unusual events that could materially affect the company s capital resources 
the company generated approximately   and  of cash flow from operations during   and  respectively 
the fluctuations are principally attributable to growth of preneed life premiums in and a decrease in preneed life premiums in and cash used by investment activities of   and  during   and respectively  relates primarily to investing additional preneed life premiums in fixed maturity securities  although the total also includes investing  of cash and short term balances outstanding at december  cash used by financing activities during of  includes  of debt repayments   of net withdrawals of policyholder deposits and  used to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the  of cash used by financing activities during includes  of debt repayments and  of net withdrawals of policyholder deposits  partially offset by additional borrowings of  the quarterly bank loan payment due january  was paid by december   accordingly  the outstanding bank loan balance decreased by five quarterly installments during cash used by financing activities during includes debt repayments of  net withdrawals of policyholder deposits of approximately  and  used to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock  partially offset by additional borrowings of  the company is subject to various market risks 
however  the most significant such risks relate to fluctuations in prices of equity securities and interest rates 
historically  total returns on the company s equity portfolio have been very favorable and the company has successfully managed the risk of equity security price fluctuations over many years 
the company devotes significant attention to the equity markets and repositions the company s portfolio upon detection of adverse risk trends associated with individual securities or overall markets 
the company also manages market risks associated with investments in option securities  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the company s equity portfolio was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  a decline in equity prices would have reduced the fair value of the company s equity portfolio by  and  at december  and  respectively 
the average cost value of the company s equity portfolio was  and  during and  respectively 
regarding interest rate risk  the value of the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio will increase or decrease in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates while net investment income earned on newly acquired fixed maturities increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
management estimates that a basis point increase in interest rates rate shock would have decreased the fair value of its million fixed maturity portfolio by approximately or million at december  and or million at december  from an income perspective  the company does not believe rising interest rates present a significant risk  as essentially all of the company s policy liabilities bear fixed rates 
however  approximately of policy liabilities contain provisions permitting interest or benefit adjustments at the discretion of the boards of directors of the insurance subsidiaries 
the company s cash flow testing described below indicates that overall profitability will generally be enhanced in rising interest rate scenarios 
from a liquidity perspective  the company s fixed rate policy liabilities have been relatively insensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  the company believes gradual increases in interest rates do not present a significant liquidity exposure 
the company monitors economic conditions on a regular basis and manages this interest rate risk primarily by adjusting the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio 
historically  the company has maintained conservative durations in its fixed maturity portfolio 
during and  the company increased durations of the fixed maturity portfolio 
at december  cash and fixed maturity investments with maturities of less than five years equaled approximately of total policy liabilities compared to approximately at december  notwithstanding the foregoing  if interest rates rise significantly in a short timeframe  there can be no assurance that the life insurance industry  including the company  would not experience increased levels of surrenders and reduced sales  and thereby be materially adversely affected 
interest expense on the company s debt varies quarterly and is therefore also subject to interest rate risk 
for its commercial bank debt  the company elects the lower of the prime lending rate or the one month libor rate plus 
for its related party debt  the interest rate is the higher of or the commercial bank prime lending rate plus 
at december   the weighted average rate on the company s  of borrowings was 
the company believes its current liquidity position and profitability levels are adequate to guard against this interest rate risk 
in addition to the measures described above  the life insurance subsidiaries comply with the naic promulgated standard valuation law svl which specifies minimum reserve levels and prescribes methods for determining them  with the intent of enhancing solvency 
the svl also requires the company to perform annual cash flow testing for its life insurance subsidiaries 
this testing is designed to ensure that statutory reserve levels will maintain adequate protection in a variety of potential interest rate scenarios 
the actuarial standards board of the american academy of actuaries also requires cash flow testing as a basis for the actuarial opinion on the adequacy of the reserves which is a required part of the annual statutory reporting process 
cash flow testing projects cash inflows from assets and cash outflows for liabilities in various assumed economic and yield curve scenarios 
this is a dynamic process  whereby the performance of the assets and liabilities is directly related to the scenario assumptions 
an example would involve the credited interest rate on annuity products and how such rates vary depending upon projected earnings rates  which are based upon asset performance under a particular economic scenario 
the life insurance subsidiaries most recent cash flow testing  which was completed in february  involved a review of two basic measures 
the first was the value of free market surplus  which is defined as the difference between the projected market value of assets and liabilities at the end of the analysis period typically years 
deficits could indicate the need for corrective action depending upon the severity and the number of scenarios in which a deficit appeared 
a second measure involved distributable earnings 
negative earnings for extended durations might impair the ability of the life insurance subsidiaries to continue without exhausting surplus 
again  depending upon severity and frequency  corrective measures might be needed 
based on results of the testing  no corrective measures were indicated at the current time 
however  such testing is ongoing and dynamic in nature and future events in the interest and equity markets or a significant change in the composition of life insurance subsidiaries business could negatively impact testing results and require the initiation of corrective measures 
any necessary corrective measures could take one or more forms 
the duration of existing assets might not match well with those of the liabilities 
certain liabilities  such as those associated with indemnity accident and health  short term disability and group dental products  are short term in nature and are best matched with cash and short term investments 
by contrast  whole life insurance  which involves lifetime obligations  is usually best matched by longer duration maturities 
in the event there are insufficient assets of these types  a repositioning of the investment portfolio might be undertaken 
initially balanced durations do not guarantee positive future results 
asset type  quality  and yield will vary depending upon the economic scenario tested 
liabilities will be similarly affected 
projected reinvestment yields may cause overall yields to fall below those required to support projected liabilities 
in that event  portfolio realignment might involve the type  quality and yield of investments rather than duration 
alternatively  additional reserve amounts could be allocated to cover any future shortfalls 
the above discussion centers on asset management 
other possible corrective measures might involve liability realignment 
the company s marketing plan could be modified to emphasize certain product types and reduce others 
new business levels could be varied in order to find the optimum level
