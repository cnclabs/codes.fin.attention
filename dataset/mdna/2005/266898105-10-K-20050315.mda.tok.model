item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in risk factors 
overview dusa is a pharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the research  development  and marketing of a drug named aminolevulinic acid  or ala  used in combination with appropriate light devices in order to detect or treat a variety of medical conditions 
the trademark for our brand of ala is levulan 
when levulan is used and followed with exposure to light to produce a therapeutic effect  the technology is called photodynamic therapy  or pdt 
when levulan is used and followed with exposure to light to detect medical conditions  the technology is called photodetection  or pd 
our products are levulan topical solution using our kerastick brand applicator  and our blu u brand light unit 
our products are used together to provide pdt for the treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses  or aks  of the face or scalp 
in addition  the blu u is used without levulan for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris and general dermatological conditions 
both products have received approval or market clearance as required from the us food and drug administration fda and regulatory approval from health canada 
at this time  our core objectives include i focusing on increasing sales in the us which we will do by increasing the size of our force  and ii conducting clinical trials to treat moderate to severe acne vulgaris and photodamaged skin  which  if successful  could lead to additional regulatory approvals and ultimately increased revenues 
in addition  we continue to advance development of levulan pdt for the treatment of dysplasia in patients with barrett s esophagus  and support independent investigator trials to advance research in the use and applicability of levulan pdt for other indications 
we have primarily devoted our resources to fund research and development in order to advance the levulan pdt pd technology platform and  as a result  we have experienced significant operating losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to continue to incur operating losses until sales of our products increase substantially 
achieving our goal of becoming a profitable operating company is dependent upon continued acceptance of our therapy by the medical and consumer constituencies  and our ability to develop and or acquire new products 
we operate in a highly regulated and competitive environment 
our competitors include larger fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies 
many of the organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  greater experience in drug development and in obtaining regulatory approvals  and greater manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities than we do 
marketing and sales activities since the october launch of our sales force have resulted in significant additional revenues as well as expenses 
kerastick unit sales to end users were  for the twelve months ended december   consisting of  units sold in the us  and  units sold by coherent amt  our canadian marketing and distribution partner under our license promotion distribution and supply agreement dated as of march  a summary of quarterly kerastick unit sales to end users during the periods ended december  and is indicated below q q q q total united states canada total q q q q total united states canada total the net number of blu u units placed in doctors offices during the twelve months ended december  was  including placed in canada 
as of december  there were units in doctor s offices  consisting of in the us and in canada 
there were blu u units in doctors offices at december  although the costs related to the addition of our sales force and related marketing activities are significant as compared to the revenue generated from the increase in sales  we are encouraged with the quarterly increases in sales 
we have continued our efforts to penetrate the market by expanding our sales coverage in key geographic locations 
see section entitled results of operations marketing and sales costs 
we have begun to examine the costs and regulatory requirements associated with seeking foreign marketing approvals for our products 
if we proceed with this effort without a partner  our operating costs will increase 
however  we expect that an important focus during will include seeking corporate alliances for the marketing and sales of levulan pdt outside the us and canada  subject to appropriate regulatory approvals 
dusa has continued to support efforts to improve reimbursement levels to physicians 
some physicians have suggested that reimbursement levels did not fully reflect the required efforts to routinely employ our therapy in their practices 
we believe that this issue has adversely affected the economic competitiveness of our products with other ak therapies and has hindered the adoption of our therapy 
however  we continue to work to improve reimbursement levels  and have recently been notified of reimbursement changes for that are expected to be positive for doctors using our therapy 
several major private insurers have approved coverage 
we believe that due to these efforts  along with our education and marketing programs  and increased interest in other potential uses for our products  more widespread adoption by the medical community will occur over time 
we have been encouraged by the positive response from many physicians and patients who have used our therapy  but we recognize that we have to continue to demonstrate the clinical value of our unique therapy  and the related product benefits as compared to other well established conventional therapies  in order for the medical community to accept our products on a large scale 
while our financial position is strong  we cannot predict when product sales may offset the costs associated with these efforts 
we are aware that some physicians have been using levulan with the blu u  and with light devices manufactured by other companies  for uses other than our fda approved use 
while we are not permitted to market our products for so called off label uses  these activities are positively affecting the sales of our products 
we are also aware that some compounding pharmacies may be exceeding the legal limits for their activities  including manufacturing and or selling quantities of ala in circumstances which may be inducing purchasers to infringe our intellectual property 
these activities may be negatively impacting our sales growth 
therefore in december  and in january   we filed lawsuits against compounding pharmacies 
see section entitled legal proceedings 
as of december   we had a staff of full time employees and part time employees  as compared to full time employees and part time employee at the end of  including marketing and sales  production  maintenance  customer support  and financial operations personnel  as well as those who support research and development programs for dermatology and internal indications 
on january   we announced the appointment by dusa s board of directors of mr 
robert f 
doman as our president and chief operating officer effective january  as a result of mr 
doman joining dusa  dr 
d 
geoffrey shulman resigned his position as president of the company and mr 
jay haft resigned as chairman of the board of directors also effective january  dr 
shulman remains as dusa s chief executive officer and has been re appointed to the position of chairman of the board of directors 
mr 
haft retains his position as lead director and has been appointed to the position of vice chairman of the board of directors 
transactions during  dusa entered into a number of transactions  all designed to foster future growth of its levulan pdt platform 
clinical trial agreements signed with the national cancer institute to further our objectives concerning treatment of barrett s esophagus and other internal indications using levulan pdt  on september  we signed a clinical trial agreement with the national cancer institute  or nci  division of cancer prevention  or dcp  for the clinical development of levulan pdt for the treatment of high grade dysplasia within barrett s esophagus 
in addition  on november  we signed an additional clinical trial agreement with the nci dcp for the treatment of oral cavity dysplasia 
dusa and the nci dcp will be working together to prepare overall clinical development plans for levulan pdt in these indications  starting with phase ii be trials  and phase i ii oral cavity trials  and continuing through phase iii studies if mutually agreeable 
the immediate plan is for the nci dcp to solicit clinical protocols from its extramural expert clinical investigator consortium  after which time dusa and the nci dcp will finalize the clinical trial designs 
the nci dcp will use its resources to file its own investigational new drug applications with the fda 
dusa will provide levulan  to laser device s and the necessary training for the investigators involved in the studies at an estimated cost during of approximately  dusa will maintain full ownership of its existing intellectual property  has options on new intellectual property and  subject to successful clinical trial results  intends to seek fda approvals for the indications being studied 
see section entitled results of operations year ending december  as compared to research and development costs 
amended and restated purchase and supply agreement on june   dusa signed an amended and restated purchase and supply agreement with national biological corporation nbc  the manufacturer of its blu u light source 
this agreement provides for the elimination of certain exclusivity clauses  permits dusa to order on a purchase order basis without minimums  and other modifications of the original agreement  providing both parties greater flexibility related to the development and manufacture of light sources  and the associated technology within the field of pdt 
dusa paid  to nbc upon execution of the agreement which will be amortized over the remaining term of the agreement  expiring november  third party canadian marketing and distribution agreement on march   dusa signed an exclusive canadian marketing and distribution agreement for the kerastick and blu u with coherent amt inc coherent  a leading canadian medical device and laser distribution company 
coherent began marketing the blu u for moderate inflammatory acne in april and the kerastick for the treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses  or aks  in june  following receipt of the applicable regulatory approval from health canada 
the agreement has a three year term  which can be automatically renewed for additional one year terms  unless either party notifies the other party prior to a term expiration that it does not intend to renew the agreement 
in addition  during the initial three year term  either party may terminate the agreement earlier by providing formal written notice of its intention to do so at least days in advance of each anniversary of the effective date  or in the event that the other party shall have materially breached any of its obligations in the agreement 
february private placement on february   dusa entered into definitive agreements with certain institutional and other accredited investors for the private placement of  shares of its common stock at a purchase price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds to dusa of  the closing date of the private placement was march  dusa also issued additional investment rights providing the investors with the right to purchase up to an aggregate of an additional  shares of common stock at per share 
all of the additional investment rights were exercised on april   resulting in additional proceeds of  offering costs incurred in connection with the placement were  of which  consisted of the placement agent s commission and non refundable retainer paid in the form of  shares of common stock calculated at the offering price 
dusa will use the proceeds from the sale of the securities to expand its sales force and for general working capital purposes  including research and development activities 
re acquisition of canadian product rights on february   dusa reacquired the rights to the aminolevulinic acid levulan technology for canada held by draxis health inc  or draxis 
these rights were initially assigned to draxis in at the time of the original licensing of the patents underlying our levulan pdt platform from parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario 
dusa and draxis terminated the assignment and dusa agreed to pay to draxis an upfront fee of  cdn  usd at february  and a royalty on sales of the levulan kerastick in canada over a five year term commencing in june based on the first kerastick sale in canada by coherent  our canadian marketing and distribution partner 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods and that can significantly affect our financial position and results of operations 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed these policies and the underlying estimates used in applying these accounting policies with our audit committee 
since not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting policies 
we consider the following policies and estimates to be critical to our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues on product sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred  and there is reasonableness of collection 
product sales made through distributors who have a general right of return of product have been recorded as deferred revenue until the product is sold by our distributors to the end user 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  significant unanticipated changes in our estimates due to business  economic  or industry events could have a material impact on our results of operations 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological development  or significant changes to our business model could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we use sales projections to estimate the appropriate level of inventory that should remain on the consolidated balance sheet 
management believes that the recorded value of kerastick inventory is reasonable in light of our current sales forecasts 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
at december   total property  plant and equipment had a carrying value of  including our manufacturing facility which received fda approval in july and began inventory production in february as of december   we had intangible assets totaling  recorded in deferred charges and other assets relating to the unamortized balance of payments incurred in to nbc to amend our agreement to develop and manufacture of light sources and to draxis to reacquire our product rights in canada 
see sections entitled transactions amended and restated purchase and supply agreement and transactions re acquisition of canadian product rights 
dusa had no intangible assets recorded as of december  stock based compensation we have elected to continue to use the intrinsic value based method to account for employee stock option awards under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 and to provide disclosures based on the fair value method in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
stock or other equity based compensation for non employees is accounted for under the fair value based method as required by sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and other related interpretations 
under this method  the equity based instrument is valued at either the fair value of the consideration received or the equity instrument issued on the date of grant 
the resulting compensation cost is recognized and charged to operations over the service period which  in the case of stock options  is generally the vesting period 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 which will impact the accounting for employee stock options and other equity based compensation 
the standard requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will not affect our cash flow or financial position  but it will affect our net income loss and earnings per share 
in accordance with the revised statement  we will recognize the expense attributable to stock options that are granted or vest in periods ending subsequent to june  as described in note m to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  had the company expensed its employee stock options under sfas no 
for the year ended december   net loss and net loss per share would have increased by approximately  or per share  respectively 
as share options are determined each year  the impact to the company s financial statements of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted with certainty 
results of operations year ending december  as compared to revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in and were comprised of the following increase kerastick product sales united states canada total blu u product sales united states canada total total product sales the increase in product sales reflects sales to physicians of  kerastick units  respectively  as compared to  kerastick units in  and an increase in the blu u units in place in physician s offices of units as of december   up from units at december  with respect to us kerastick sales  we have increased our direct selling and distribution efforts  while still maintaining the services of one external distributor 
we expect to continue to increase our internal distribution capabilities in order to increase our gross revenue and net profit per unit 
although our costs will also increase to support this function  since we increased our price per kerastick in november   we expect to see a significantly higher average margin per kerastick in on march   dusa signed an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement for the kerastick and blu u in canada with coherent amt inc coherent  a leading canadian medical device and laser distribution company 
following receipt of regulatory approval from health canada  coherent began marketing the blu u for moderate inflammatory acne in april  and the kerastick for the pdt treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses  or aks  in june dusa recognizes product sales when coherent sells the kerastick and or the blu u to the end user  as the price is fixed and final at that point 
kerastick product sales through our canadian distributor for the year ended december  were  and there were blu u units in physician s offices as of december  the increase of kerastick and blu u sales in the us during is a result of the efforts of our larger sales force  and related marketing and sales activities 
in addition  the increase in blu u placements is caused  in part  by our ability to sell the blu u to physicians as a stand alone device for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris and general dermatological conditions following fda clearance in september blu u sales during the quarter ended december  decreased as expected  compared with the prior quarter  due to a planned price increase that became effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter  and a decreased emphasis on blu u placements by our sales force  in light of our shrinking blu u inventory levels at that time 
we ordered additional blu u units in the fourth quarter of  and started to be re supplied during the first quarter of as we experienced a backlog until the new supply of light sources started to become available  blu u revenues were limited during the fourth quarter of  and have been limited until being re supplied during the first quarter of we believe that growth of kerastick unit sales were adversely affected during this time by limited blu u sales as it takes some time for a new customer to build up kerastick usage levels after initially using the therapy 
the temporary shortage of blu u units during that period may have an ongoing effect on the rate of growth in kerastick sales levels going forward 
although the level of kerastick sales to end users for is substantially higher than the level in the prior year  kerastick sales must continue to increase significantly in order for dusa to become profitable 
to reach that goal  we significantly increased the size of our sales force and geographic reach during in  we plan to continue to increase the capacity of our sales force and continue our participation in many medical conferences 
however  should photocure launch its pdt product in the us our sales could be significantly diminished since photocure s marketing partner  galderma sa  has a much larger sales force and greater resources than we do 
see section entitled results of operations year ending december  as compared to general and administrative costs 
cost of product sales and royalties cost of product sales and royalties for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in the components of cost of product sales and royalties for the years ended december  and  including direct and indirect costs to support our product are provided below increase decrease cost of product sales and royalties product costs including internal costs eg customer service  quality assurance  purchasing  depreciation  amortization and other product support operations assigned to support products kerastick product costs costs incurred to ship  install and service the blu u in physicians offices royalty and supply fees total cost of product sales and royalties the decrease in product costs for primarily reflects the capitalization of labor and overhead associated with the manufacture of kerastick units in our facility 
these costs were expensed in the prior year due to the absence of production 
although there were direct blu u product sales in and  there were no related direct blu u product costs as these units had a zero book value due to inventory impairment charges recorded during royalty and supply fees are paid to our licensor  parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario  and starting in  amortization of an upfront fee and a royalty are paid to draxis  dusa s former parent  on sales of the levulan kerastick in canada 
research and development costs research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in this increase reflects the preparation work associated with initiating the phase ii photodamaged skin trial  protocol finalization and initiation of our phase ii acne trial  and the start of our phase ii pilot study for barrett s esophagus offset  in part  by lower third party expenditures for our fda mandated phase iv clinical study of the long term efficacy of the kerastick 
this fda mandated phase iv study was completed in late and we incurred only limited costs to file the final report with the fda in we have concentrated our dermatology development program on indications that use our approved kerastick 
based on market research that was completed in  we have moved forward with our phase ii clinical studies for use of levulan pdt in photodamaged skin and moderate to severe acne vulgaris 
we initiated the photodamaged skin study during the second quarter of  and a phase ii study on levulan pdt for the treatment of acne vulgaris at the end of october as our phase ii clinical trials proceed  and especially at such time as we may commence phase iii trials in these indications  research and development expenses are expected to increase significantly 
we have also begun to examine the costs and regulatory requirements associated with seeking foreign marketing approvals for our products  which could cause the research and development budget to increase 
in addition  expenses include compensation of  for the services of consultants 
these consultants originally received  fully vested stock options as compensation which were subsequently repurchased for  in december in response to new guidelines of pharmaceutical industry groups that prohibit physicians from having an ownership interest in companies with which they are affiliated 
furthermore  dusa is also evaluating whether to develop and or license additional light devices and this cost to develop and or license has not been determined at this time 
dusa has also been following patients who completed phase i ii studies in the treatment of high grade and low grade dysplasia associated with barrett s esophagus 
in order to move forward with this indication  on september  dusa signed a clinical trial agreement with the national cancer institute  division of cancer prevention  or nci dcp  for the clinical development of levulan pdt for the treatment of high grade dysplasia within barrett s esophagus 
in addition  to further our objectives concerning treatment of internal indications using levulan pdt  on november  we signed an additional clinical trial agreement with the nci dcp for the treatment of oral cavity dysplasia 
dusa and the nci dcp will be working together to prepare overall clinical development plans for levulan pdt in these indications  starting with phase ii trials  and continuing through phase iii studies  if mutually agreeable 
the immediate plan is for the nci dcp to solicit clinical protocols from its extramural expert clinical investigator consortium  after which time dusa and the nci dcp will finalize the clinical trial designs 
the nci dcp will use its resources to file its own investigational new drug applications with the fda 
dusa will provide levulan  to laser device s and the necessary training for the investigators involved in the studies 
dusa is in the process of estimating its costs of this program 
dusa will maintain full ownership of its existing intellectual property  has options on new intellectual property and  subject to successful phase ii and iii clinical trial results  intends to seek fda approvals in due course 
in preparation for new phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of high grade dysplasia associated barrett s esophagus  we initiated a small single center pilot phase ii clinical trial during using dusa s new proprietary endoscopic light delivery device 
we have entered into a series of agreements for our research projects and clinical studies 
as of december   future payments to be made pursuant to these agreements  under certain terms and conditions  total approximately  for this amount does not include any amounts which may become due to photonamic gmbh co 
kg under the terms of our license and development agreement 
see note f to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in connection with the nci dcp programs mentioned above  we may incur in an additional costs during of approximately  we expect research and development costs to continue to increase as we invest in our clinical programs 
marketing and sales costs marketing and sales costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for these costs consist of overhead expenses such as salaries and benefits for the marketing and sales staff  commissions  and related support expenses such as travel  and telephone  totaling  in and  in the remaining expenses consist of tradeshows  miscellaneous marketing expenses and outside consultants totaling  in and  in these increases were mainly attributable to the launch of our direct sales force in october and related marketing and sales activities 
as of december   our sales force was comprised of direct sales professionals  including managers and representatives  and various independent representatives in key target markets 
the level of marketing and sales expenses and related support functions will continue to increase in as we expand our sales capacity with an additional direct representatives during early we estimate that it takes a sales representative approximately months to break even in comparison to dusa s investment 
in addition  we are considering whether to hire a contract sales force in addition to our direct representatives and we will be evaluating the sales force again in mid in light of revenues and customer needs 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for other than legal costs as described below  this increase is mainly attributable to a higher level of general corporate expenses to support our expanding business  including an increase in audit and consulting fees primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance work of  an increase in personnel related costs of  and an increase in general corporate expenses of  general and administrative costs also include legal expenses incurred in of  and  in  due primarily to the photocure patent litigation costs in australia 
total patent defense costs in were  as compared to  in we expect these patent defense costs to decrease in even with the current legal disputes in which we are engaged 
in april  photocure asa filed suit against queen s university at kingston  ontario  alleging that australian patent no 
 which is one of the patents licensed by parteq to us  relating to ala technology  was invalid 
as a consequence of that action  queen s university assigned the australian patent to us so that we could participate directly in this litigation 
we filed an answer setting forth our defenses and a related countersuit alleging that certain activities of photocure and its marketing partner  galderma sa  infringe the patent 
we are unable to predict the decision of the federal court of australia  which we expect during however  should photocure prevail in either part of the case  ie the court finds that i our patent is invalid  or ii the patent is valid  but photocure s product does not infringe the patent  photocure will be able to market its product in australia 
each party has the right to appeal within approximately one month of the court s decision 
in august  dusa  photocure and galderma entered into a mediation agreement designed to facilitate resolution of the parties potential patent disputes concerning photocure and galderma s methyl aminolevulinate product 
the parties discussions are on going 
in december  dusa was served with a complaint filed in the state of michigan circuit court for the county of oakland alleging that dusa s blu u caused the plaintiff to suffer a seizure during the performance of her duties as an office assistant 
the complaint named berlex laboratories  inc  a subsidiary of our former marketing partner  as another defendant 
the case was dismissed in december in december  dusa filed a lawsuit against new england compounding center of framingham  massachusetts alleging violations of us patent law in the us district court in boston  massachusetts 
in january  dusa filed a lawsuit against the cosmetic pharmacy of tucson  arizona alleging violations of the lanham act for false advertising and trademark infringement  and of us patent law in the us district court for the district of arizona 
dusa is seeking injunctive relief  monetary damages and costs in both lawsuits 
these cases are in their early stages and we are unable to predict the outcomes at this time 
other income  net other income for the year ended december  decreased to  as compared to  in this decrease reflects a reduction in our average investable cash balances during early as we used cash to support our operating activities  offset by the additional proceeds received from the private placement in march additionally  interest income had been negatively impacted by the general decrease in interest rates which occurred during and early during and  we incurred interest expense of  and  respectively  on borrowings associated with the construction of our kerastick manufacturing facility 
of these amounts   was capitalized in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet in we repaid the outstanding secured term loan promissory note with citizens bank of massachusetts in june income taxes there is no provision for income taxes due to ongoing operating losses 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets at december  and net income loss for the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of  or per share  as compared to  or per share  for the year ended the decrease in net loss per share in as compared to is primarily due to an increase in the number of weighted average of common shares outstanding during as a result of our private placement earlier in the increase in total net loss in is due to the increase in operating costs offset  in part  by an increase in revenues 
net losses are expected to continue until product sales to physicians offset the cost of our sales force and marketing initiatives  and the costs for other business support functions 
year ending december  as compared to dermatology collaboration termination on september   dusa and schering ag  the company s former marketing and development partner for levulan pdt in the field of dermatology  terminated the parties marketing development and supply agreement  dated november  as a result of this termination  dusa reacquired all rights it granted to schering ag under the agreement  and evaluated certain items on its consolidated balance sheet for the timing of revenue recognition and potential impairment 
these items included unamortized deferred revenue related to non refundable milestone payments previously received under the agreement with schering ag  and assets including our manufacturing facility  raw material and finished goods inventories  commercial light units  and deferred charges and royalties 
as a result of this analysis  in addition to normal amortization recorded prior to the termination of the schering ag agreement  dusa recorded the following items in its consolidated statements of operations during september statement of operations item balance sheet item revenue recognition asset impairment revenues research grant and milestone revenue deferred revenue operating costs cost of product sales deferred charges inventory commercial light sources under lease or rental total cost of product sales research and development costs deferred royalty total operating cost charges in  dusa accelerated the recognition of  of unamortized research grant and milestone revenue  which was previously recorded as deferred revenue 
in  dusa charged i  to cost of product sales and royalties for deferred charges associated with its amended supply agreement with sochinaz sa  the manufacturer of the bulk drug ingredient used in levulan  ii  to cost of product sales and royalties for deferred charges associated with underutilization costs paid to national biological corporation nbc  the manufacturer of our blu u  and iii  to research and development costs for deferred royalties associated with payments to parteq  the company s licensor 
these amounts represented the unamortized balances of previously deferred costs which were being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
in  dusa recorded lower of cost or market adjustments for estimated excess blu u inventory of  and  for bulk levulan based on i the termination of the company s former dermatology collaboration arrangement  ii limited product sales since the september product launch  and iii the company s expectations at that time of no significant near term increases in kerastick sales levels and or blu u placements 
in  dusa recorded an additional  of depreciation expense reflecting a shortened useful life of our blu u units under lease  rental  or trial arrangements to reflect a three year asset life 
this accelerated depreciation policy was attributable to the low level of blu u placements at the date of the termination of the collaboration arrangement  and management s expectations at that time that near term placements would be limited 
revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in revenues for included research grant and milestone revenues of  comprised of the one time recognition in september of unamortized up front milestone and unrestricted grant payments previously received from schering ag totaling  due to the termination of this relationship  and normal amortization of  earned prior to the termination

underutilization costs commenced in and were fully amortized as of december  based on agreements with our third party manufacturers due to orders falling below certain previously anticipated levels 
deferred charges amortization reflects consideration paid by us in to amend our supply agreement with sochinaz sa  the manufacturer of the bulk drug ingredient used in levulan 
such deferred charges were fully amortized in see section entitled results of operations year ending december  as compared to dermatology collaboration termination 
research and development costs research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the overall lower level of research and development costs in was attributable  in part  to the absence of co sponsored project costs that were agreed to under the collaboration termination in  of which approximately two thirds  or  were previously reimbursed to us by our former marketing partner 
based on market research that was completed earlier in  we decided to move forward with phase ii studies for use of levulan pdt in photodamaged skin and acne 
in  we also received market clearance from the fda on a section k premarket notification application for use of the blu u without levulan to treat moderate inflammatory acne 
the development program also included the completion of an fda mandated phase iv long term ak tracking study  which was completed at the end of  with the final report submitted to the fda in january dusa also funded various investigator studies involving ala and or the kerastick 
the decrease in research and development costs in was also attributable to the assignment of personnel and related costs to marketing and sales functions as of january  that were previously functioning in research and development roles  which totaled  in in addition  costs incurred in included the write off of  of previously deferred royalties associated with payments to parteq  our licensor  and a  milestone payment under our license agreement signed in december between dusa and photonamic gmbh co 
kg  a subsidiary of medac gmbh  a german pharmaceutical company 
in addition  we may become obligated to pay certain regulatory milestones of  upon fda acceptance of a registration application for a brain cancer product in the us  and an additional  upon registration of the product and royalties of on net sales under the terms of the license and development agreement 
this agreement also grants a license of photonamic s proprietary technology related to ala in the field of brain cancer 
research and development costs for also included higher third party expenditures in support of our fda mandated phase iv clinical study of the long term efficacy of our marketed product  clinical feasibility studies in other dermatological indications  and our phase i ii clinical studies on the safety and efficacy of levulan pdt treatment of barrett s esophagus with and without dysplasia 
marketing and sales costs marketing and sales costs for were  comprised of  in payroll related costs  including direct and indirect commissions  with the remaining balance in support of such efforts 
in the prior year  there were no marketing and sales expenses incurred directly by us as all rights and activities associated with marketing and sales of our products were the sole responsibility of our former partner 
in addition  as of january   we reassigned resources that were functioning in research and development roles to our marketing and sales function 
in august  dusa hired an associate vice president of sales  and in october we hired  trained  and deployed a regional sales force  which was initially comprised of six direct representatives  various independent representatives  and an independent sales distributor  to focus on most of our key geographic markets in the us 
at the end of december  we hired our seventh direct representative in a key target market 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for this increase was mainly attributable to higher legal expenses incurred in of  as compared to  in  due primarily to patent defense costs in the photocure litigation described above 
these increased legal expenses were offset  in part  by lower staffing related costs of approximately  in  due primarily to employee separations during other income  net other income for the year ended december  decreased to  as compared to  in this decrease reflected lower levels of investable cash balances as we used cash to support our operating activities  and a decline in yields 
other income in included  of gains on the sale of securities to meet planned cash operating requirements 
there were no such sales of securities in during and  we incurred interest expense of  and  respectively  on borrowings associated with the construction of our kerastick manufacturing facility 
of these amounts   and  was capitalized in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet in and  respectively 
income taxes there is no provision for income taxes due to ongoing operating losses 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  although we had net income for  there was no income tax expense because the majority of the revenue we recognized in connection with the termination of the schering ag agreement had been taxable in prior years for income tax purposes 
we provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets at december  and net income loss for the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of  or per share  as compared to net income of  or per share  for the year ended as a result of the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  net income for included a one time increase of approximately  excluding normal amortization recorded prior to termination  based on the acceleration of previously deferred revenue and costs  and other related adjustments for impairment 
see section entitled results of operations year ending december  as compared to dermatology collaboration termination 
this one time recognition resulted in an increase to earnings per share of for the period 
net losses are expected to be incurred until the successful market penetration of our products occurs  ie  until end user sales offset the cost of launching our sales force  marketing initiatives  and costs for other business support functions 
quarterly results of operations the following is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively quarterly results for year ended december  march june september december total revenues loss from operations net loss basic and diluted loss per share quarterly results for year ended december  march june september december total revenues loss from operations net loss basic and diluted loss per share liquidity and capital resources we remain in a strong cash position to continue to fund increased levulan pdt sales and marketing expenses and current research and development activities for our levulan pdt pd platform 
at december   we had approximately  of total cash resources comprised of  of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities available for sale totaling  and restricted cash of  as of december   these securities had yields ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from january  to february  in august  we changed our investment policy to allow investment of a portion of its securities in high grade corporate bonds in order to improve yields earned on our marketable securities 
on february   we consummated a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share resulting in gross proceeds of  we also granted the investors the right to purchase up to an aggregate of an additional  shares of common stock at per share  which were exercised on april   resulting in additional proceeds of  offering costs incurred in connection with the placement were  of which  consisted of the placement agent s commission and non refundable retainer paid in the form of  shares of common stock calculated at the offering price 
as of december   our working capital total current assets minus total current liabilities was  as compared to  as of december  total current assets increased  in due primarily to the gross proceeds received from the private placement of  offset mainly by the net use of  of cash and cash equivalents to support our operating activities 
total current liabilities increased  in due primarily to an increase in other accrued expenses for dermatology consulting fees related to the phase ii clinical studies for use of levulan pdt in photodamaged skin and moderate to severe acne vulgaris  and an overall increase in operations 
in may  we entered into a secured term loan promissory note with citizens bank of massachusetts to fund the construction of our manufacturing facility and borrowed  and in june we repaid the outstanding  loan balance 
during  we purchased  of property  plant  and equipment additions and made payments on long term debt of  during  we received  in net proceeds from the private placement   in proceeds from stock option exercises  and invested  of net proceeds from maturations and sales of marketable securities 
during the comparable period  we used  of cash for operating activities  purchased  of property  plant and equipment  and received net proceeds of  from maturations and purchases of us government securities 
we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to proceed with our current programs for levulan pdt  and to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we have invested our funds in liquid investments  so that we have ready access to these cash reserves for funding our needs on a short term and long term basis 
we are seeking to expand or enhance our business by using resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  new technologies  or products  especially in dermatology related areas in the near term 
for  we are focusing primarily on increasing the sales of the levulan kerastick  acquiring and or licensing dermatology products that will provide our sales force with additional complementary products to sell  continuing phase ii studies for use of levulan pdt in photodamaged skin and acne using our kerastick  and exploring corporate alliance opportunities for levulan pdt for dermatology in europe and or other countries outside of the us and canada 
full development and testing of all potential indications would require additional funding 
the timing of expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including the level of sales of our products including the success of our marketing programs for the dermatological uses of levulan pdt  progress of our research and development programs  the results of preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of regulatory marketing approvals  competitive developments  the results of patent disputes  any new additional collaborative arrangements  if any  we may enter  and the availability of other financing 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the level of revenues from sales of our products 
in order to maintain and continue to expand our sales and marketing endeavors  and to initiate our planned research and development programs  we may need to raise additional funds through future corporate alliances  financings  or other sources  depending upon the amount of sales we generate 
the total capital costs used to develop our manufacturing facility  which was approved to manufacture the levulan kerastick by the fda in july  was approximately  including equipment 
we have also incurred certain environmental control costs as part of our development of a production line for kerastick manufacturing to ensure that our facility complies with environmental standards 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future  or any assurance that our operations  business or assets will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations

recently issued accounting guidance in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 which will impact the accounting for employee stock options and other equity based compensation 
the standard requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will not affect our cash flow or financial position  but it will affect our net income loss and earnings per share 
in accordance with the revised statement  we will recognize the expense attributable to stock options that are granted or vest in periods ending subsequent to june  as described in note m to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  had the company expensed its employee stock options under sfas no 
for the year ended december   net loss and net loss per share would have increased by approximately  or per share  respectively 
as share options are determined each year  the impact to the company s financial statements of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted with certainty 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no
