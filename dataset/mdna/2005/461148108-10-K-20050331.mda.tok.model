item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
words such as believes  expects  anticipates and the like indicate forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include comments related to our projected revenue  gross margin  operating expense  profitability  income tax expense  effective tax rate  capital spending and cash balances  the adequacy of our cash balances to fund our operations  projected volatility in our financial results  projected customer requirements for new capacity and technology upgrades for our installed base of magnetic disk manufacturing equipment and when  and if  our customers will place orders for these products  projected change from period to period in the customers  and location of customers  that constitute the majority of our revenues  the length of development  marketing and deployment cycles for military customers  imaging s ability to proliferate its technology into major military weapons programs and to develop and introduce commercial products  and the timing of delivery and or acceptance of our backlog for revenue 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements for a variety of reasons  including those set forth under certain factors which may affect future operating results and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our operations include two businesses  an equipment business and an imaging business 
the equipment business designs  manufactures  markets and services complex capital equipment that deposits highly engineered thin films of material onto disks used in hard disk drives 
our imaging business develops and manufactures electro optical sensors  cameras and systems that permit highly sensitive detection of photons in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum  allowing vision in extreme low light situations 
equipment business in the early s we developed a system  the mdp  to deposit magnetic films and protective overcoats onto magnetic disks used in hard disk drives 
this system gained wide acceptance and by the late s was being used to manufacture approximately half of the disks used in hard disk drives worldwide 
in late  we introduced a new system  the lean 
as of december we had delivered twelve lean systems 
we believe that there are a total of approximately mdp and lean systems currently in use in production and research and development applications 
the hard disk drive industry has gone through significant consolidation  and there are now only seven significant manufacturers of magnetic disks  some of whom also manufacture hard disk drives 
as a result of an increasingly smaller number of customers and the high average selling price of our products  our equipment revenues tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our equipment business has historically been subject to capital spending cycles 
for example  in the period from through the middle of  we sold million of disk manufacturing equipment 
in the period from the middle of thru our disk equipment revenues averaged approximately million per year and consisted of the sale of a limited number of systems  technology upgrades  parts and service for the installed base of our systems 
in our sales of disk manufacturing equipment grew to approximately million as a result of sales of our new lean system 
we believe the majority of magnetic disk manufacturers are now utilizing most of their capacity 
we believe that the expected introduction in of high density disks based on perpendicular recording techniques will also require disk manufacturers to significantly upgrade the technical capability of their installed base of manufacturing equipment to accommodate the additional number of process steps predicted to be required by perpendicular recording technology roadmaps 
we also have historically manufactured both deposition and rapid thermal processing equipment used in the manufacture of flat panel displays 
since  cumulative revenues from sales of flat panel display manufacturing systems totaled million 
in late we sold our rapid thermal processing product line to photon dynamics of san jose  california 
since then  we have focused our sputtering equipment efforts on disk manufacturing and have not taken orders for any new flat panel display manufacturing systems 

table of contents imaging business our imaging business develops and manufactures electro optical sensors  cameras and systems that permit highly sensitive detection of photons in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum  allowing imaging in extreme low light situations 
our military products include extreme low light sensors and cameras for use in short to medium range military applications and livar cameras and systems for positive target identification at long range 
the majority of the funding for our photonics technology division s activities has historically come from research and development contracts with the united states government and its contractors  with the balance being funded internally 
in  we began working with a foreign customer on the development of a low light camera for use in that customer s military head mounted system  which our customer is under contract to deliver to the armed forces of a nato country 
in  we began delivering two standard products  nightvista low light cameras and model livar cameras 
developing advanced products for the military involves long development cycles  as products move through successive multi year stages of technology demonstration  engineering and manufacturing product development  prototype production and then product deployment 
each stage in this process requires ongoing government funding 
to date  substantially all of our imaging business revenues has been derived from contract research and development  rather than product sales 
in july  in order to shorten the time to market and to increase the number of markets for our imaging products  we began to fund development of imaging products for commercial markets 
revenues from these activities have not yet been significant 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial conditions and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
many of these uncertainties are discussed in the prior section entitled certain factors which may affect future operating results 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with us gaap  and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates we make in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates related to the collectibility of trade receivables  valuation of deferred tax assets and prototype product costs 
we believe that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either 
table of contents do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operation for a given period 
revenue recognition certain of our system sales with customer acceptance provisions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have previously met defined customer acceptance levels with the specific type of system  then we recognize revenue for the fair market value of the system upon shipment and transfer of title  and recognize revenue for the fair market value of installation and acceptance services when those services are completed 
we estimate the fair market value of the installation and acceptance services based on our actual historical experience 
for systems that have generally not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  revenue recognition is typically deferred until customer acceptance 
for example  while initial shipments of our lean system were recognized for revenue upon customer acceptance during  we expect that leans will be generally be recognized for revenue upon shipment during in some instances  hardware that is not essential to the functioning of the system may be delivered after acceptance of the system 
in these cases  we estimate the fair market value of the non essential hardware as if it had been sold on a stand alone basis  and defer recognizing revenue on that value until the hardware is delivered 
we perform best efforts research and development work under various government sponsored research contracts 
these contracts are a mixture of cost plus fixed fee cpff and firm fixed price ffp 
revenue on cpff contracts is recognized in accordance with contract terms  typically as costs are incurred 
revenue on ffp contracts is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
provisions for estimated losses on ffp research contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined 
inventories inventories are priced using standard costs  which approximate first in  first out  and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated excess and obsolescence by the difference between its costs and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
our warranty is per contract terms and is typically months from customer acceptance 
we also sell extended warranties beyond months to some customers 
we use estimated repair or replacement costs along with our actual warranty experience to determine our warranty obligation 
we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations net revenues 
net revenues consist primarily of sales of equipment used to manufacture magnetic disks  equipment used to manufacture flat panel displays  related equipment and system components  and contract research and development related to the development of electro optical devices and systems 
net revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents equipment revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in equipment revenues was the result of the sale of eleven lean systems and two mdp systems and an increase in revenue from disk equipment technology upgrades and spare parts 
during  we sold two disk sputtering systems and recognized revenue on upgrades to five d star systems that were originally delivered in equipment revenues declined slightly between and as a result of the closure of the fabrication center in net revenues for include million of sales of rapid thermal processing equipment  a product line we sold in november our fabrication center  which manufactured machined parts  contributed sales to outside customers of  in the fabrication center was closed in september we replaced the fabrication center with a smaller model shop during the model shop manufactures engineering prototypes and parts for use in our products 
the magnetic disk manufacturing industry has now consolidated into a small number of large manufacturers 
we believe that the majority of our active customers now utilize most of their capacity and that there is significant potential for these customers to both resume adding capacity and to upgrade the technical capability of their installed base to permit production of high density disks for perpendicular recording rather than the current longitudinal technology 
in the past few months we have responded to requests for quotes from five customers related to delivery of the lean system 
while there is no guarantee that these customers will actually place orders for new disk sputtering systems  our outlook for the equipment business in is positive and we expect our revenues will grow relative to imaging revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in imaging revenues was primarily the result of an increase in cost shared development programs  especially our military head mounted display development activities 
this reduced the revenue we could generate per employee in imaging 
commercial sales of imaging products increased in the fourth quarter  with nightvista and livar cameras delivered to a total of customers 
in  imaging revenues increased due primarily to an increase in revenues from contract research and development and  to a lesser extent  increased revenue from the sale of prototype products 
in  we expect the imaging business revenue to grow  with increases in both contract research and development revenue and product revenue  although we don t anticipate our imaging business will be profitable in substantial growth in future imaging revenues is dependent on proliferation of our technology into major military weapons programs  the ability to obtain export licenses for foreign customers  obtaining production subcontracts for these programs and the successful launch of our commercial products 
our backlog of orders at december  was million  as compared to a december  backlog of million  and does not include orders for new systems that we announced early in as of march   we have announced new orders for nine lean systems and four mdp b systems 
the million of backlog at december  consisted of million of equipment backlog and million of imaging backlog 
the million of backlog at december  consisted of million of equipment backlog and million of imaging backlog 
the decrease in equipment backlog was primarily the result of the recognition for revenue of eleven intevac lean disk sputtering systems that were in backlog at december  most of our backlog at december  is scheduled for either customer acceptance or delivery during significant portions of our revenues in any particular period have been attributable to sales to a limited number of customers 
in  seagate and equipment sales through matsubo  our japanese distributor  each accounted for more than of our revenues  and in aggregate accounted for of revenues 
in  komag  seagate  lockheed martin and equipment sales through matsubo  each accounted for more than of our revenues  and in aggregate accounted for of revenues 
in  seagate  toppoly and the us army communications electronics command each accounted for more than of our consolidated net revenues and in aggregate accounted for of consolidated net revenues 
our largest customers tend to change from period to period 
international sales totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  accounting for  and of net revenues 
international revenues include products shipped to overseas operations of us companies 
the increase in international sales in over was 
table of contents primarily due to an increase in net revenues from disk sputtering systems 
the increase in international sales in over was primarily due to an increase in net revenues from disk system upgrades and components 
substantially all of our international sales are to customers in the far east 
our mix of domestic versus international sales will change from period to period depending on the location of our largest customers in each period 
gross margin 
cost of net revenues consists primarily of purchased materials and costs attributable to contract research and development  and also includes fabrication  assembly  test and installation labor and overhead  customer specific engineering costs  warranty costs  royalties  provisions for inventory reserves and scrap 
gross margin was  and in  and  respectively 
gross margin in equipment was  and in  and  respectively 
equipment gross margin was adversely impacted by costs incurred during the rapid production  installation and start up of the initial production run of lean systems  and by costs for scrap and rework and actual and expected obsolescence  related primarily to design changes on our lean system 
this was partially offset by higher margins on revenue from disk equipment technology upgrades and spare parts 
equipment gross margin in improved over due primarily to a reduction in inventory provisions and improved absorption of manufacturing overhead due to an increase in manufacturing volume late in the year 
gross margin was negatively impacted by poor margins achieved on the five d star deposition system upgrades and the sale of a used disk sputtering system at a reduced price 
equipment gross margin in was favorably impacted by lower production costs and by a reduction in inventory provisions  partially offset by the under absorption of manufacturing overhead due to low manufacturing volume 
we expect the gross margin for the equipment business to improve in  primarily as a result of cost reduction efforts undertaken on the lean system 
however  we had two high cost lean systems in inventory at year end that were built during and are not expected to achieve margins as high as the margins expected on systems produced in gross margins in the equipment business will vary depending on a number of factors  including product cost  system configuration and pricing  factory utilization  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
gross margin in imaging was  and in  and  respectively 
imaging gross margin was impacted by our military head mounted display development program 
the initial phase of this program was partially funded by the us government and our nato customer 
the portion of this cost shared program being funded by intevac is reported in cost of sales  and as a result  this program made a negative contribution to gross profit in imaging gross margin improved in over due to most of the revenue being derived from fully funded  rather than cost shared  research and development contracts and from the sale of prototype products 
we expect imaging gross margin to improve in  relative to  as the cost sharing portion of the military head mounted display development program was largely completed at the end of  and revenue in will be derived primarily from fully funded research and development contracts and to a lesser extent  from the sale of products 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of prototype materials  salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities for disk manufacturing equipment  flat panel manufacturing equipment and imaging products 
research and development expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of net revenue 
research and development expenses declined in due to a reduction in spending for imaging products and flat panel manufacturing equipment  partially offset by increased spending for the development of disk manufacturing equipment and the initiation of a project to develop a new equipment product line 
the increase in research and development expense in was primarily the result of higher spending for the lean disk sputtering system and for commercial imaging products  partially offset by decreased spending for flat panel products 
we expect that research and development spending in will increase over as a result of two projects 
in equipment we are constructing the first engineering prototype for our new product line and the cost of this prototype will be charged to research and development expense 
in imaging  we have commissioned the design of a proprietary cmos sensor for use in our military low light level cameras 

table of contents research and development expenses do not include costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to contract research and development  which are included in cost of net revenues 
research and development expenses also do not include costs of  and  incurred by us in and  respectively  and reimbursed under the terms of research and development cost sharing agreements related to development of disk manufacturing equipment 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of selling  marketing  customer support  financial and management costs and also includes production of customer samples  travel  liability insurance  legal and professional services and bad debt expense 
domestic sales and international sales of disk manufacturing products in singapore  malaysia and taiwan are made by our direct sales force  whereas other international sales of disk manufacturing and other products are made by distributors and representatives that provide services such as sales  installation  warranty and customer support 
we also have a subsidiary in singapore to support customers in southeast asia 
selling  general and administrative expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of net revenue 
the increase in was primarily the result of increases in marketing and business development headcount and sarbanes oxley compliance activities  partially offset by a reduction of surplus facility costs being recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
the increase in over was primarily the result of million of surplus facility costs being recorded in selling  general and administrative expense  partially offset by a reduction in representative commissions paid 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in over the amount spent in due primarily to a projected increase in field offices  headcount  travel  sarbanes oxley compliance activities and employee benefit costs 
interest expense 
interest expense consists primarily of interest on our convertible notes and amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest expense totaled  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in was due to the elimination of our convertible notes outstanding as a result of the automatic conversion of our convertible notes due notes in the fourth quarter of and the repayment of the remaining million of our convertible notes due in march the decrease in interest expense in was due to a reduction in the convertible notes outstanding  as a result of both the exchange offer completed in and the conversion of our notes 
we expect our interest expense to be insignificant in interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net totaled million   and million in  and  respectively 
interest income and other  net in consisted of  of dividends from california avenue llc   of interest income on investments and  of early payment discounts and other income 
interest income and other  net in consisted of  of dividends from california avenue llc  a  gain on the sale of the rapid thermal processing product line   of interest income on investments and  of early payment discounts and other income  partially offset by  of expense related to the disposition of fixed assets 
interest income and other  net in consisted of  of interest income on investments  a million gain on the sale of the rapid thermal processing product line  a  gain on the sale of fixed assets   of dividends from california avenue llc and  of early payment discounts and other income 
we expect interest income and other  net to increase in due primarily to higher interest rates realized on our investments 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
in  we recorded income tax expense of  due primarily to the recording of  of expense as a result of a claim we received from the california franchise tax board for a portion of income tax credits we claimed in prior years  partially offset by a net credit for taxes owed by our singapore subsidiary 
our net deferred tax asset totaled zero at december   net of a million valuation allowance 
we have substantial net operating loss carry forwards which can be used to limit the taxes paid in the future and to reduce our effective tax rate to less than the statutory income tax rates in effect 

table of contents in  we recorded income tax expense of  due primarily to foreign tax expense on income earned by our singapore subsidiary 
our net deferred tax asset totaled zero at december   net of a million valuation allowance 
in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
this resulted from the enactment of the job creation and worker assistance act of which increased the length of time  from two years to five years  over which losses incurred in and could be carried back against taxes paid in prior years 
we paid federal income taxes of approximately million for  million for and million for our federal tax returns  and any refunds resulting from them  are subject to audit for three years from the date filed 
our net deferred tax asset totaled zero at december   net of a million valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources our operating activities in used cash of million 
the cash used was primarily the result of the net loss incurred  an increase in inventory and a decrease in customer advances  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and by depreciation 
operating activities used cash of million in the cash used was primarily the result of the net loss incurred and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in customer advances  a decrease in inventory and by depreciation 
operating activities provided cash of  in the cash provided was primarily a result of the refund of federal income taxes paid in prior years  decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  depreciation and amortization  partially offset by the operating loss 
our investing activities in used cash of million as the result of the purchase of investments and fixed assets 
investing activities in used cash of million as the result of the purchase of fixed assets  which was partially offset by additional proceeds from the sale of the rapid thermal processing product line 
investing activities in provided cash of million as a result of the sale of the rapid thermal processing product line and the sale of equipment  which was partially offset by the purchase of fixed assets 
our financing activities provided cash of million in due to a public offering of our common stock and the sale of our common stock through our employee benefit plans  partially offset by the repayment of the remaining million of our convertible notes due financing activities provided cash of million in due primarily to the sale of intevac common stock to our employees through our employee benefit plans 
financing activities used cash of million in  primarily as a result of the exchange of most of our convertible notes due for new convertible notes due and cash 
on july  we completed the exchange of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes due for million of our new convertible subordinated notes due and million in cash  including million for accrued interest 
sales of intevac common stock to our employees through our employee benefit plans provided cash of million in at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments 
we intend to undertake approximately million in capital expenditures during the next months  and we believe our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months 
we have incurred operating losses each year since and cannot predict with certainty when we will return to operating profitability 
we believe an upturn in demand for the type of disk manufacturing equipment we produce is occurring  and we expect our equipment business to be profitable in we also expect to continue to be in the investment mode in imaging during  but with lower losses than in 
table of contents contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that will be settled in cash 
these obligations consist primarily of operating lease and purchase obligations 
the expected future cash flows required to meet these obligations as of december  are shown in the table below 
more information on the operating lease obligations is available in part ii
