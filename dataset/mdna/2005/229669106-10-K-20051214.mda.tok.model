item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our two primary businesses are in the defense and transportation industries 
for the year ended september   of sales were derived from defense  while were derived from transportation fare collection systems and other commercial operations 
these are high technology businesses that design  manufacture and integrate complex systems to meet the needs of various federal and regional government agencies in the us and other nations around the world 
the us government remains our largest customer  accounting for approximately of sales in compared to in and in cubic defense applications is a diversified supplier of constructive  live and virtual military training systems  services and communication systems and products to the us department of defense  other government agencies and allied nations 
we design instrumented range systems for fighter aircraft  armored vehicles and infantry force on force live training  weapons effects simulations  laser based tactical and communication systems  and precision gunnery solutions 
our services are focused on training mission support  computer simulation training  distributed interactive simulation  development of military training doctrine  force modernization services for nato entrants and field operations and maintenance 
our communications products are aimed at intelligence  surveillance  and search and rescue markets 
cubic transportation systems develops and delivers innovative fare collection systems for public transit authorities worldwide 
we provide hardware  software and multiagency  multimodal transportation integration technologies and services that allow the agencies to efficiently collect fares  manage their operations  reduce shrinkage and make using public transit a more convenient and attractive option for commuters 
consolidated overview sales in fiscal were million compared to million in  an increase of  and the fourth consecutive year of double digit sales growth 
sales of million in represented a increase over sales of million 
all of the sales growth in both and came from the defense segment  while transportation systems sales were virtually flat for the three year period from to the growth in defense sales all came from existing businesses  while nearly million of the growth in fiscal defense sales came from the training systems business we acquired at the end of transportation systems made two small acquisitions  one at the end of and one early in  which added about million to fiscal transportation systems sales 
see the segment discussions following for further analysis of segment sales 
operating income fell to million in compared to million in  representing a decrease 
operating income in increased by over operating income of million 
the primary cause of the decrease in operating income in was an operating loss of million incurred in the transportation systems segment  compared to operating income for the segment of million in defense operating income decreased from million in to million in primarily due to a change in sales from mature to newer systems with significant research and development content 
operating income was also impacted in by the costs of initial year compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of these costs  which are included in corporate and other costs in our segment reporting  amounted to million and included consultants  software and additional audit fees 
in  both segments posted operating income improvements over  with the bigger increase coming from the defense segment 
operating income in was impacted by a million provision for a legal matter that arose from a contract with the government of iran in although this was a defense related contract  we did not include this provision in the defense segment due to the remote connection of this matter to our current defense operations  since the events in question occurred more than years ago 
see the segment discussions following for further details of segment operating results 
net income in was million per share  down from million per share in net income in was nearly the same as net income of million per share 
the drop in net income in was primarily because of the operating loss in the transportation systems segment  and was further impacted by the decrease in defense segment operating income 
approximately million of the net income was from a reduction in tax contingency reserves in the fourth quarter  while million  after taxes  of the net income was from a gain on the sale of a life insurance policy in the third quarter 
the loss provision for the iran legal matter described above reduced net income in the fourth quarter by approximately million after taxes 
approximately million  after taxes  of the net income was from gains on the sale of two parcels of real  which were no longer used in the business 
the following table provides insight into our results of operations by summarizing the effects of these items on our net income in millions earnings before certain identified items gains on sale of assets provision for litigation iran reversal of tax contingency reserves net income as reported the gross margin fell to in compared to in and in this decrease in reflects the losses incurred on contracts in the transportation systems segment and lower margins from the defense segment due to a loss in the communications and electronics business unit 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to of sales compared to in and in sg a expenses in the defense segment increased in both and in support of the higher sales volume  but decreased as a percentage of sales in transportation systems sg a expenses decreased in  after having increased in due to legal  consulting and engineering support costs incurred that year related to a contractual dispute with a former subcontractor 
company sponsored research and development r d spending increased in over the level  however  r d costs continued to be incurred primarily in connection with customer funded activities 
we do not rely heavily on company sponsored r d  as most of our new product development occurs in conjunction with the performance of work on our contracts 
the amount of contract required development activity increased in to million  compared to million in and million in  however  these costs are included in cost of sales as they are directly related to contract performance 
interest and dividend income increased in over both and due to somewhat higher cash balances available for investment and higher interest rates 
other income increased in compared to  primarily because of increased foreign currency exchange gains on intercompany advances to our uk subsidiary  primarily in the first quarter 
interest expense increased in both and due to higher amounts of short term borrowings during each year than in the previous year 
our effective tax rate for was of pretax income compared to in and in the decrease in our effective rate in was due primarily to the reversal of tax contingency provisions related to a foreign and a domestic state tax matter  each of which was resolved in our favor during  or subsequent to  the fourth quarter 
our effective tax rate could be affected in future years by  among other factors  the mix of business between us and foreign jurisdictions  our ability to take advantage of available tax credits  and audits of our records by taxing authorities 
tax legislation enacted in repealed the extraterritorial income eti exclusion relating to export sales 
over a transition period which began in  the new tax rules phase out the eti exclusion benefit and provide for a new tax deduction in computing profits from the sale of products manufactured in the united states 
the tax benefit we realize from the new legislation is expected to be substantially equivalent to the benefit we realized under the repealed eti exclusion 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax legislation enacted in that provides incentives for repatriation of capital to the us we must determine if it will be beneficial to take advantage of the provisions of the legislation by reinvesting some amount of capital in the united states in fiscal we believe that if the decision is made to reinvest a portion of this capital in the us  the related tax liability will not have a material impact on cubic s results of operations or financial position 
defense segment years ended september  in millions defense segment sales communications and electronics training systems government services other defense segment operating income communications and electronics training systems government services tactical systems and other defense sales grew to million in from million in  a increase 
all of the increase in sales was organic  coming from businesses we owned in the biggest sales increase came from the government services business unit  which increased from million in to million in the increase in government services sales came both from new contracts and the expansion of existing programs 
the most significant growth came from a contract at the joint readiness training center jrtc in fort polk  la  in support of combat training exercises and from contracts for modeling the effects of weapons of mass destruction 
training systems sales increased by  from million to million  as a result of growth in sales of air and ground combat training systems and laser engagement systems to the us and allied governments 
air combat training sales increased in as activity on the major idiq contract we won in expanded 
ground combat training sales also increased due to training ranges we are building in canada  australia and the middle east 
we received new orders during the year for multiple integrated laser engagement systems miles  resulting in higher sales from this product line as well 
communications and electronics sales decreased from million in to million in  as sales of legacy data link and avionics products declined 
we are encouraged by orders we received recently for our new communications and electronics products  which we expect will generate higher sales for this product line in the future 
defense sales of million in represented an increase of over sales of million 
of the increase in sales  nearly million came from the simulation systems division ssd acquired in september  which is included with training systems in the foregoing table 
not including ssd  defense sales would have increased from to this growth came despite a decrease of nearly million in training systems sales  other than from ssd  due primarily to a decline in air combat training sales from the level 
miles sales also decreased in  but this decrease was more than offset by higher sales from ground combat training systems 
communications and electronics business unit sales were also higher in because of a contract we won in to develop a common data link subsystem cdls for the us navy 
government services sales increased by million in  a increase 
as in  the most significant sales increase in government services came from the jrtc contract 
other than from jrtc  government services sales grew by in operating income in the defense segment fell to million in from million in  a decrease  after having increased in higher operating income from training systems and government services was more than offset by an operating loss in communications and electronics and start up expenses for the joint venture we entered into early in the year 
this joint venture arrangement with the us subsidiary of rafael armament development authority ltd 
rafael  an israeli company  will manufacture certain rafael products for sale to the us and israeli defense forces 
this new company began operations during the second quarter this year  but did not receive its first contract award until shortly before the close of the fiscal year and  therefore  had no sales in fiscal the business incurred approximately million in expenses in  which are included in the table above under the caption tactical systems and other 
cubic is the primary beneficiary of the venture  as defined in fin consolidation of variable interest entities  therefore  we consolidated this joint venture in our financial statements 
as a result  all of the income and expenses of this business are included in the calculation of operating income even though it is only owned by cubic 
minority interest in the net loss from this business is reflected on the income statement and minority interest in the net assets is included on the balance sheet 
the operating loss in communications and electronics in was primarily due to cost growth totaling nearly million on two contracts  one a program involving a new intelligence application of our data link and receiver technology and the other the cdls contract mentioned above 
in addition  approximately million in overstocked or obsolete communications products inventory was written down in value to zero 
this inventory valuation adjustment was due primarily to the transition of this product line from building predominately surveillance receivers to building power amplifiers 
in addition  the decrease in sales of legacy data link and avionics products reduced operating income by more than million 
with the transition to the new communications and electronics products now complete  we are optimistic that this business unit can return to profitability in fiscal operating income in communications and electronics improved in over primarily because was impacted by a loss provision of million related to our investment in new communications technology for the cdls contract 
in addition  communications and electronics operating income was bolstered in by performance on another data link contract with a foreign customer 
avionics products  such as personnel locator systems  generated higher operating income in  however  this was offset by operating losses from the surveillance receiver product line 
training systems operating income increased in  compared to  because of higher sales from ground combat training and miles contracts 
however  operating income as a percentage of sales decreased slightly because a portion of the sales growth came from ground combat training ranges in canada  australia and the middle east that have low profit margins 
in addition  two new contracts for laser engagement and combat training systems were in the early stages of completion in  with little or no profit recognized until they are further along toward completion 
operating income in training systems increased in over because of the acquisition of ssd late in ssd added million to training systems operating income in higher operating income from ground combat training systems in offset the profit impact of lower sales volume from air combat training systems and miles products 
government services operating income in increased over due to higher sales volume and improved operating performance 
operating income as a percentage of sales increased from in to nearly in  as sg a expenses did not increase in proportion to the sales increase  thereby improving the profit margin 
government services operating income improved in compared to primarily because of higher sales volume  but also because of improved performance from operations and maintenance o m contracts 
the o m business recorded a loss in on one particular contract which had experienced cost growth that year 
transportation systems segment transportation systems sales were nearly flat for the to period  with and virtually equal  at million  while decreased about to million 
north american sales in decreased from the level by  while sales in australia and europe increased about 
the decrease in north america was in contrast to  when north american sales increased by over sales from european service contracts also increased in  as well as sales in australia 
these increases in were offset by an expected million decrease in sales from the prestige contract in london between and due to completion of the initial system installation 
sales from the prestige contract increased about million in over the level due to increased service activities and work on contract change orders 
transportation systems made acquisitions of two small parking system companies  one at the end of and one early in  which added about million to fiscal transportation product sales 
transportation systems incurred an operating loss in of million  compared to operating income in of million 
projected costs to complete fare collection systems in five cities increased by million more than we had estimated last year  therefore  a loss of that amount was recorded on these contracts during the year 
the primary cause of the cost growth was an increase in engineering hours incurred to complete the projects 
we made progress toward completion of these projects during the year  and a significant amount of the equipment has been installed  however  the costs of accomplishing this were higher than we were previously able to anticipate 
the new cost estimates are our best estimates of the most likely costs to complete these contracts  three of which are substantially complete and two of which should be substantially complete by mid remaining tasks on the contracts are now on schedule for completion in and we expect the transportation systems segment to return to profitability in fiscal unrelated to these contracts  in the second quarter we provided an allowance of million for doubtful collection of an accounts receivable balance with a customer that terminated its contract with us 
this provision is included in sg a expenses in the consolidated statement of income 
we believe that we have substantially performed the requirements of the contract such that this payment is due to us and we believe the termination attempt by this customer is unwarranted 
we also incurred an operating loss of million from the parking company we acquired last year 
this was the result of cost growth on two contracts as well a lack of sufficient sales volume to absorb the overhead costs of the business 
a restructuring plan has been developed and will be implemented by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year costs of the restructuring and additional unabsorbed overhead expenses will result in a loss from the parking company in the first quarter of transportation systems operating income of million in increased from the level of million 
the increased operating income in compared to resulted from higher sales and improved operating performance on service contracts in europe and from a contract in the far east 
higher profits from the prestige contract in were offset by costs associated with claim settlement proceedings 
backlog september  in millions total backlog transportation systems defense communications and electronics training systems government services tactical systems total defense total funded backlog transportation systems defense communications and electronics training systems government services tactical systems total defense total in addition to the amounts identified above  the company has been selected as a participant in or  in some cases  the sole contractor for several substantial indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
idiq contracts are not included in backlog until an order is received 
the difference between total backlog and funded backlog represents options under multiyear service contracts 
funding for these contracts comes from annual operating budgets of the us government and the options are normally exercised annually 
options for the purchase of additional systems or equipment are not included in backlog until exercised 
new accounting standards in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  inventory costs sfas no 

this accounting standard  which is effective for annual periods beginning after june   requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results or operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations totaled million in  offsetting negative cash flows from operations in the previous two years of million in and million in the greatest contributor to positive cash flows in was a million decrease in accounts receivable 
both the defense and transportation systems segments generated positive cash flows in  with the total split nearly equally between them 
operating cash flows from the defense segment were positive in all three years  while transportation systems operating cash flows were negative in and  before turning positive in a portion of the transportation systems positive cash flows in came from an million claim settlement received in october related to the prestige project  with the remainder coming from normal contractual payments 
we expect transportation systems cash flows to continue to be positive in fiscal  as contract milestones are reached  triggering customer payments that have been deferred due to the contract performance issues described in the transportations systems discussion above 
growth in accounts receivable due to these deferred milestone payments accounted for the majority of the increase in accounts receivable and the negative cash flows in in fiscal  million in negative cash flows came from the prestige project  however  this contract generated positive cash flows in both and  in addition to the claim settlement mentioned above 
we have classified certain unbilled accounts receivable balances as noncurrent because we do not expect to receive payment within one year from the balance sheet date 
at september   million of the million related to the prestige project  while at september   million of the million balance related to prestige 
cash flows used in investing activities in included million in capital expenditures  partially offset by the liquidation of million in marketable securities that had been held for sale 
investing activities in included a million cash receipt from the sale of a life insurance policy  million in capital expenditures  million used for acquisitions and the net purchase of marketable securities held for sale of million 
in  investing activities included million in proceeds from the sale of two pieces of real estate which were no longer used in the business 
in addition  a net amount of million was used to purchase marketable securities  million was used for an acquisition and million was used for capital expenditures 
financing activities in included scheduled debt payments of million  dividends paid to shareholders of million cents per share and net borrowings of million on a short term basis 
short term borrowings in new zealand of million were repaid in  while million was borrowed on a short term basis in canada to fund transportation systems operations there and a net of million was added to short term borrowings in the us in we obtained a mortgage on our facility in the uk and used the proceeds to repay million of short term borrowings made in fiscal in the uk we borrowed million in new zealand in on a short term basis to fund working capital growth in our defense subsidiary in that country and borrowed million in the us on a short term basis to fund domestic working capital requirements 
other financing activities included scheduled debt payments of million in and million in  and the payment of million in dividends to shareholders in both and accumulated other comprehensive income decreased by million in because of foreign currency translation adjustments of million and an increase in the minimum liability for our pension plan of million 
this leaves a positive balance of million in accumulated other comprehensive income as of september  compared to million at september  the pension plan under funded balance increased from the september  balance of million to a september  balance of million 
the plan assets generated a healthy return again this year  however  growth in the net benefit obligation  caused primarily by lower long term interest rates  caused the under funded balance to increase 
pension expense decreased from million in to million in due to an increase in plan assets available for investment and a lower actuarial loss than in we expect our pension expense to increase in fiscal by about million  back to the level  due primarily to the increased actuarial loss experienced in fiscal we contributed million to the plans in and expect to make contributions of at least million during fiscal the net deferred tax asset was million at september  compared to million at september  of these amounts  million and million at september  and  respectively  resulted from the tax effect of recording an additional minimum pension liability 
we expect to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
our financial condition remains strong with working capital of million and a current ratio of at september  we expect that cash on hand and our ability to access the debt markets will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the short term borrowing arrangements we have in the uk  new zealand and canada  we have a committed five year credit facility from a group of financial institutions in the us  aggregating million 
as of september   million of this amount was used  with approximately another million available under a technical financial ratio calculation 
our total debt to capital ratio at september  was  which is at a conservative level and well below industry averages 
the following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding as of september  total less than year years years after years in millions long term debt interest payments operating leases deferred compensation critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  valuation of goodwill and p ension costs 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
besides the estimates identified above that are considered critical  we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and judgments are also based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as c ircumstances change and additional information becomes known  even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed critical 
this discussion of critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments should be read in conjunction with other disclosures included in this discussion  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates  contingencies and new accounting standards 
significant accounting policies are identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed each of the critical accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition most of our business is derived from long term development  production and system integration contracts which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  and the aicpa s statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts  and the types of products and services provided  when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally  we record revenue for long term fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
most of our long term fixed price contracts require us to deliver minimal quantities over a long period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in relation to the total value of the contract 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on a ratio of the costs incurred to the estimated total costs at completion 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in the contract value only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
provisions are made on a current basis to fully recognize any anticipated losses on contracts 
we record sales under cost reimbursement type contracts as we incur the costs 
incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profits  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs 
we have accounting policies in place to address these and other complex issues in accounting for long term contracts 
sales of products are recorded when a firm sales agreement is in place  delivery has occurred and collectibility of the fixed or determinable sales price is reasonably assured 
sales of services are recorded when performed in accordance with contracts or service agreements 
sales and profits on contracts that specify multiple deliverables are allocated to separate units of accounting when there is objective evidence that each accounting unit has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
separate units of accounting are based upon values assigned under the terms of such contracts 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax return positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
ta x regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements and are referred to as timing differences 
in addition  some expenses are not deductible on our tax return and are referred to as permanent differences 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions we have taken on our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we have not recognized any united states tax expense on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to reinvest the earnings outsid e the united states for the foreseeable future 
these undistributed earnings totaled approximately million at september  valuation of goodwill we evaluate our recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
we have not yet had a case where the carrying value exceeded the fair value  however  if it did  impairment would be measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined would be recorded in the current period 
to date there has been no impairment of our recorded goodwill 
goodwill balances by reporting unit are as follows september  in millions defense systems and products defense services transportation systems total goodwill determining the fair value of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
we currently perform internal valuation analysis and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparisons with recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables 
pension costs the measurement of our pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on high quality corporate long term bonds 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience in relation to the inflation assumption 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  our historical experience  our investment strategy and the views of investment managers and large pension sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated an d amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we invest in money market instruments and short term marketable debt and equity securities that are tied to floating interest rates being offered at the time the investment is made 
we maintain short term borrowing arrangements in the us  us  new zealand and canada  which are also tied to floating interest rates libor and the us prime rate and the us and new zealand base rates 
we also have senior unsecured notes payable to insurance companies that are due in annual installments 
these notes have fixed coupon interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest income earned on our short term investments is affected by changes in the general level of us and us interest rates 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
interest expense incurred under the short term borrowing arrangements is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  us  new zealand and canada 
the expense related to these cost streams is usually not hedged since it is either revolving  payable within three months and or immediately callable by the lender at any time 
interest expense incurred under the long term notes payable is not affected by changes in any interest rate because it is fixed 
however  we have in the past  and may in the future  use an interest rate swap to essentially convert this fixed rate into a floating rate for some or all of the long term debt outstanding 
the purpose of a swap would be to tie the interest expense risk related to these borrowings to the interest income risk on our short term investments  thereby mitigating our net interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this point in time 
there was no interest rate swap outstanding at september  foreign currency exchange risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into firm sale and purchase commitments denominated in many foreign currencies 
we have a policy to hedge those commitments greater than  by using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary responsible for the commitment  typically the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  new zealand dollar and australian dollar 
these contracts are designed to be effective hedges regardless of the direction or magnitude of any foreign currency exchange rate change  because they result in an equal and opposite income or cost stream that offsets the change in the value of the underlying commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our foreign currency translation and transaction accounting policies 
we also use balance sheet hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
this strategy involves incurring british pound denominated debt see interest rate risk above and having the option of paying off the debt using us dollar or british pound funds 
we do not believe that we are significantly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk at this point in time 
investments in our foreign subsidiaries in the uk  australia  new zealand  and canada are not hedged because we consider them to be invested indefinitely 
in addition  we generally have control over the timing and amount of earnings repatriation and expect to use this control to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk
