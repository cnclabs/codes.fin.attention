item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook the total backlog for the company was approximately million at june   up million over june  the backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts 
the funded portion of this backlog at june  is approximately million 
this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by congress and or funded by the customer 
the unfunded backlog is approximately million and represents firm multi year orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated by congress 
while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program  management has included in unfunded backlog only those programs that it believes are likely to receive funding 
the unfunded backlog at june  was zero 
during fiscal year  while net sales decreased  new orders received by the company were approximately million 
the sales backlog of approximately million at june  gives the company a solid base of future sales and  therefore  management expects a significant increase in sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition to the backlog  the company currently has outstanding quotations representing in excess of million in the aggregate for both repeat and new programs 
many potential orders are currently being discussed and negotiated with our customers 
the outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies  transformers  and subassemblies 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will acquire any or all of the anticipated orders described above  many of which are subject to allocations of the united states defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry and military procurement generally 
results of operations net sales for fiscal years ended june   and  were   and  respectively 
the decrease in net sales in as compared to  was a result of the previously disclosed decline in the company s backlog during fiscal specifically  the company shipped fewer transmitter components in fiscal  as compared to the increase in net sales in as compared to was the result of increased transmitter component shipments on two of the company s products 
in fiscal  the company realized the benefits of increased business with existing customers and continued to establish new customer relationships 
new orders received in fiscal were approximately million compared to approximately in fiscal the sales backlog at june   as discussed above  includes significant orders for military and industrial power supplies  and contracts to manufacture certain customer products in accordance with pre engineered requirements 
the primary factor in determining gross profit and net income is product mix 
the gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are higher than with respect to the products  which are still in the engineering development stage or in the early stages of production 
in any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin mature programs and less mature programs including loss contracts  has a significant impact on gross profit and net income 
for fiscal years ended june   and gross profits were   and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was   and  for fiscal   and  respectively 
the improved gross profit percentage in fiscal  relates to favorable product mix  and lower esop contribution expense offset partially by decreased sales

the increase in gross profit percentage between and was predominately due to increased sales on higher margin build to print transmitter components

selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended june   an increase of  or as compared to the prior year

other income for fiscal increased as compared to fiscal due to increased interest income on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments due to higher interest rates

liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business  and during the past three fiscal years  the company  when possible  has funded all of its operations with cash flows resulting from operating activities and when necessary from its existing cash and investments

net cash used by investing activities increased in fiscal due to the purchase of short term investments 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of dividends paid in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  when a special dividend of

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on our contracts 
revenue recognition and estimates a significant portion of our business is comprised of development and production contracts 
generally revenues on long term fixed price contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion 
percentage of completion accounting requires judgment relative to expected sales  estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule 
contract costs include material  subcontract costs  labor and an allocation of overhead costs 
the estimation of cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract 
given the significance of the estimation processes and judgments described above  it is possible that materially different amounts of contract costs could be recorded if different assumptions were used  based on changes in circumstances  in the estimation of cost at completion 
when a change in expected sales value or estimated cost is determined  changes are reflected in current period earnings
