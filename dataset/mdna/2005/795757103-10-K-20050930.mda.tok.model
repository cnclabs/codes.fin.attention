because management did not have a committed or approved plan to sell either our ownership interest in amap or the assets of the tabletop business as of july   the operating results of these businesses have been included in our consolidated financial statements for private exchange on september   we completed a private exchange transaction with fma cbo funding iii  ltd  in which we issued million of second lien notes in exchange for million of notes 
other strategic options as previously disclosed in an k filed on august   we continue to explore strategic options to satisfy our liquidity needs and improve our overall balance sheet position  including the payment of the approximately million in aggregate principal amounts of notes that remain outstanding after the debt exchange offer and subsequent private exchange  and enhance our operating performance 
these strategic options include potential sales of assets or businesses  the creation of new foreign debt  repurchases of outstanding subordinated notes in the open market and or through privately negotiated transactions for cash or other securities including second lien notes  common stock and or series c preferred stock and further reductions in expenses 
year in review in  salton focused its efforts on cost reductions  near term liquidity needs and investment for future growth 
significant savings of approximately million were achieved domestically as a result of the cost reductions 
however  sales were adversely impacted early in the year by inventory shortages and later in the year by uncertainty among our suppliers and customers  both domestically and internationally  as attention turned to our ability to repay and or refinance the notes 
this uncertainty continued to increase during the fourth quarter when we utilized the day grace period to pay interest due on the notes in order to review our strategic options for refinancing the notes 
additionally  foreign sales in the second half were impacted as a result of an overall softness in the retail market  especially in europe 
us restructuring plan as part of an effort to improve our domestic operations  we have successfully implemented our us restructuring plan in an effort to better align domestic operating costs with current sales levels 
through our cost reduction programs and consolidation of us operations  we have reduced domestic expenses by more than million 
this is over million above the expected million we announced one year ago 
as announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we plan to implement a second us cost reduction program to reduce domestic operations by an additional million with million to be realized in and million to be realized in fiscal year we recorded certain pretax charges as part of the finalization of the fiscal initial us restructuring plan as follows million for consulting and legal fees  termination and severance costs and costs involved in the closure of certain distribution facilities 
fiscal year we completed the initial phase of this us restructuring plan by reducing headcount in the domestic operations by approximately in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the us restructuring plan and subsequent valuation reviews in light of those decisions  we recorded certain pretax charges in the fourth quarter of as follows million write down of certain inventory identified for liquidation as part of the company s decision to rationalize warehouse and distribution facilities million of intangible asset impairment charge associated with trademarks affected by the restructuring plan million fixed assets charge related primarily to tooling million write down of costs associated with several marketing programs that were discontinued million in consulting and legal costs directly associated with the development and implementation of the us restructuring plan  and million in termination and severance costs associated with the headcount reduction in the us other items impacting the fiscal year end results include million impairment charge consisting of consolidated goodwill and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets see impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets

consists of an aggregate of million of impairment charges see impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets 
compared to net sales and gross profit salton s annual worldwide sales were billion in each of and sales from our foreign subsidiaries increased million  which included million of foreign currency fluctuation gain 
these increases were offset by a million decline in our domestic sales  which were adversely impacted in the first half of the year by inventory shortages and lower retail purchases over the prior year and the uncertainty of our suppliers and customers resulting from our increased liquidity issues in the second half of the year 
fiscal sales of the new george foreman grills with removable plates the next grilleration had a positive impact on domestic sales  which helped offset the decline faced in the domestic market 
gross profit for declined million from million in to million in the gross profit included million of fourth quarter charges in connection with the us restructuring plan announced on may  as a percent of net sales  gross profit was in compared to in  a decrease of 
the decrease would have been greater if the fourth quarter charges in connection with our us restructuring plan were excluded from gross profit for the fiscal year the fiscal decreases are primarily a result of a higher volume of amap sales at substantially lower margins due to the nature of their business in the electronics industry as well as global material cost increases in plastics  steel and corrugated materials  partially offset by a million domestic decline in distribution expenses primarily as a result of our us cost reduction programs 
the outlook for material costs remains uncertain 
although we have recently implemented price increases on certain products to compensate for higher material costs  the impact of the price increases is uncertain due to potential reactions of our competitors and the uncertainty of consumer acceptance 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales or million in compared to of net sales or million for us operations reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by million 
these decreases were partially offset by million in international increases driven by our european expansion and growth in south africa as well as million from foreign currency increases 
domestic selling  general and administrative expense decreases for fiscal year were primarily driven by a million decline in promotional expenditures for television  royalty expense  certain other media and cooperative advertising  and trade show expenses 
the million decreases included a million reduction in cooperative advertising and an million decrease in direct and infomercial advertising expenditures 
in addition  we reduced selling  general and administrative salary expenses by million 
these decreases were primarily from the efforts of our cost reduction programs 
impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we performed the annual impairment test required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon completion of the test  it was determined that a pre tax impairment charge of million was necessary to reflect management s decisions regarding certain underperforming product lines and related trademarks 
at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  management determined that the combination of the shortfall in meeting projected operating results along with the company s inability to meet its financial debt covenant requirements for its senior secured credit facility and a downgrade in its debt rating could have an adverse affect on the comparison of fair value to carrying value for goodwill and other intangible assets 
an interim impairment test was conducted at that time and we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill and the fair value of certain other indefinite lived intangible assets were less than their carrying values 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge totaling million pre tax or million net of tax  consisting of consolidated goodwill of million and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets associated with icebox  of million 
upon completion of its annual impairment test at the end of the fourth quarter  we determined that an additional charge of million was necessary against trademarks impacted by the adoption of its us restructuring plan

in addition  salton had million of exchange rate gain and million of other foreign sales increases 
the other foreign sales increases were primarily driven by the george foreman and russell hobbs product lines 
while foreman sales continued to increase internationally  domestic volume decline in the first half of the year was the primary reason for a million decrease in domestic sales for the fiscal year 
gross profit for declined million from million in to million in as a percent of net sales  it was in compared to in  a decrease of 
these decreases are attributed to a million decline in domestic gross profit associated with a volume and mix shift from higher margin george foreman products to lower margin new products such as the westinghouse electrics  melitta one one and various other new products introduced at the international housewares show 
as part of the million of domestic decline in operations  we incurred million of fourth quarter charges in connection with the us restructuring plan announced on may  these costs included inventory and tooling write downs associated with the company s decision to rationalize warehouse and distribution facilities and exit certain marketing programs 
the decreases caused by domestic gross profit declines and us restructuring costs were partially offset by a million increase due to the inclusion of a full year of amap s gross profit  million in foreign currency gains and million in other foreign gross profit increases associated with growth and expansion of our international subsidiaries 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales or million in compared to of net sales or million for the million increase in selling  general and administrative was due to increases of million driven by international growth from expansion  including million from amap and million from other foreign increases as the company launched new products internationally and expanded operations on the european continent and in brazil 
the remaining million were of international increases attributed to foreign currency fluctuations 
selling  general and administrative expenses for domestic operations increased million 
as a result of approximately million of additional expenditures for television  royalty expense  certain other media and cooperative advertising and trade show expenses 
of the million  approximately million related to cooperative advertising and promotional activities associated with an aggressive retailer position following product shortages during the holidays 
it was management s intention to drive additional sales through significant new product introductions 
we had varied success on the new product launches and continued to experience declines in overall domestic sales in the first three quarters  which was the primary driver of the us restructuring plans  launched in the fourth quarter 
as part of those plans  we incurred a million charge associated with the termination of certain advertising and marketing programs as part of our us restructuring plan 
these increases from domestic operations were offset by million of various other insignificant decreases in other selling  general and administrative expense categories 
impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets effective with the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized are subject to a fair value based impairment test on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the annual test for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is conducted during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
at the beginning of  management believed that projected operating results would validate the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on the financial statements 
as discussed in our annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission  shortfalls in future operating results or the application of more conservative market assumptions could have an adverse affect on the comparison of fair value to carrying value for goodwill and other intangible assets 
management determined that the combination of the shortfall beginning in the third quarter in meeting projected operating results along with the our inability to meet financial debt covenants required for the senior secured credit facility for two consecutive quarters and a downgrade in the debt rating could have such an adverse effect  and as such  an interim impairment test was necessary 
a valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets was conducted 
the valuation incorporated performance through the third quarter 
the valuation did not incorporate the future us restructuring plan that management started in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill and the fair value of certain other indefinite lived intangible assets were less than their carrying values 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge totaling million pre tax or million net of tax  consisting of consolidated goodwill of million and certain other indefinite lived intangible assets associated with icebox of million 
in conjunction with the us restructuring plan and extensive individual product line reviews  we completed our annual test for impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets as of the end of the fourth quarter 
as a result  we determined that an additional charge of million was necessary against trademarks impacted by the us restructuring plan 
restructuring costs as a result of our us restructuring plan  we incurred million in restructuring costs consisting of million for consulting and legal costs directly associated with the development and implementation of the restructuring plan and million associated with the termination and severance cost as a result of a us headcount reduction in the fourth quarter 
net interest expense net interest expense was million for both fiscal and fiscal our rate of interest on amounts outstanding under the revolver  term loan and senior subordinated debt was a weighted average annual rate of in fiscal and in fiscal the average amount of all debt outstanding was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this was a result of lower average borrowings under the current and former revolver and term loan agreement and our repayment of certain other obligations

income taxes income tax expense was a tax benefit of million in fiscal as compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the effective tax rate benefit for federal  state  and foreign income taxes was approximately in versus approximately in the effective tax rate benefit in is less than the fiscal tax rate primarily because of million of non deductible goodwill that was written off as a result of an impairment charge in and million of tax reserves provided as a valuation allowance against certain foreign income tax credits that have a five year life for us tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations our primary sources of liquidity are our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
in  salton s operations used million in cash flow  compared with proceeds of million in this decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in our accounts payable 
our accounts payable balances declined as a result of tightening credit terms in the second half of fiscal as the company faced the december maturity of its million bonds and restructuring alternatives

this interest was paid on july  however  as a result of these uncertainties  the company has experienced tightening credit terms from its sources of supply 
our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
we generally negotiate our purchase orders with our foreign manufacturers in united states dollars 
thus  our cost under any purchase order is not subject to change after the time the order is placed due to exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the weakening of the united states dollar against local currencies could result in certain manufacturers increasing the united states dollar prices for future product purchases

discussion of critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate these estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for inventory valuation  reserve for returns and allowances  valuation of reporting units with goodwill  valuation of intangible assets having indefinite lives  cooperative advertising accruals  pension benefits and depreciation and amortization 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies required the most significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we calculate allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we utilize a number of tools to evaluate and mitigate our customer credit risk 
management evaluates each new customer account using a combination of some or all of the following sources of information credit bureau reports  industry credit group reports  customer financial statement analysis  customer supplied credit references and bank references 
appropriate credit limits are set in accordance with our credit risk policy and monitored on an on going basis 
existing customers are monitored and credit limits are adjusted according to changes in their financial condition 
based on the procedures outlined herein  and the fact that no customer accounted for or more of the gross accounts receivable at july  and july   we believe there is no concentration of credit risk 
our exposure to credit loss on our foreign currency forward contracts in the event of non performance by the counterparties is believed to be remote due to the requirements that the counterparties consist only of major financial institutions that have a long term credit rating of single a or better from both moody s and standard poor s 
additionally  our foreign currency forward contracts generally have a term of one year or less 
inventory valuation the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market  and regularly reviews the book value of discontinued product lines and stock keeping units skus to determine if these items are properly valued 
if market value is less than cost  the company writes down the related inventory to the estimated net realizable value 
the company regularly evaluates the composition of inventory to identify slow moving and obsolete inventories to determine if additional write downs are required 
the company s domestic inventories are generally determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
these inventories account for approximately and of the company s inventories as of and  respectively 
all remaining inventory cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
see note inventories 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to lawsuits and other claims related to product and other matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business 
we maintain reserves and or accruals for such costs that may be incurred  which are determined on a case by case basis  taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes  as well as the potential range of probable loss 
the reserves and accruals are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated for new developments or new information as appropriate 
intangible assets we record intangible assets through transactions and acquisitions 
the cost of acquisitions are allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
under current accounting guidelines that became effective on july   goodwill arising from transactions occurring after july  and any existing goodwill as of june  are not amortized to expense but rather assessed annually for impairment 
other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are also assessed annually for impairment 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
further  when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using a variety of techniques including discounted future cash flows  which are based on estimated future operating results 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows 
commitments and contingencies to facilitate an understanding of the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  the following data is provided payments due by period within after total year years years years in thousands long term debt    short term debt   capital lease obligations   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      reflects commitments subsequent to july  for debt exchange of senior subordinated notes due and for senior second lien notes due amounts do not include interest payments

additional consideration to be paid to sonex international corporation based on net sales after allowances  commencing after net sales of sonex products exceed million 
as of july   the company will continue to accrue and shall owe up to an additional million 
forward looking we anticipate capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to be at historical levels in relation to net sales 
we believe that a future cash flow from operations based on our current level of operations  b available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  second lien credit agreement and other sources of debt funding and c funds from the sale or monetization of certain assets will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for current capital expenditures  working capital requirements  interest and income tax payments and scheduled debt payments  including the remaining outstanding notes  for the next twelve months 
our ability to satisfy our anticipated liquidity requirements  however  is subject to several assumptions  some of which are beyond our control  including a general economic  financial  competitive and other factors  b our continued compliance with covenants in our debt instruments  and c our ability to repurchase subordinated notes in the open market and or through privately negotiated transactions for cash or other securities including second lien notes  common stock and or series c preferred stock 
if we are unable to satisfy our liquidity needs  we could be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  borrowing additional funds  restructuring indebtedness  selling other assets or operations and or reducing expenditures for new product development  cutting other costs  and some or such actions would require the consent of our senior lenders  holders of second lien notes and or the holders of our subordinated notes 
we cannot assure you that any of such actions could be effected  or if so  on terms favorable to us  that such actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our liquidity needs and or that such actions would be permitted under the terms of our senior secured credit facility  the second lien credit agreement or the indentures governing our subordinated notes 
factors that could affect our liquidity and capital resources are also discussed in item business risk factors

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk 
our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs through the use of interest rate swaps 
our objectives in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt  and hedge foreign currency commitments of future payments and receipts by purchasing foreign currency forward contracts 
the following tables provide information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major risk exposures are changing interest rates in the united states and foreign currency commitments in our foreign subsidiaries

the variable rate on the second lien credit facility is set at a libor rate plus an applicable margin 
we use foreign currency forward contracts with terms of less than one year  to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in managing our foreign currency exposures  we identify and aggregate naturally occurring offsetting positions and then hedge residual balance sheet exposures 
at july   we had forward contracts outstanding for the purchase of million over the course of the next twelve months  which had an aggregate fair value of million
