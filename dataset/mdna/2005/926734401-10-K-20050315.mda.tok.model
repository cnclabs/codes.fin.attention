table of contents reconciliation of non gaap financial measures this section includes certain performance measures that may be considered non gaap financial measures under sec rules and regulations 
management believes that these financial measures provide investors and analysts useful additional insight into our company s financial position and performance 
management also uses these financial measures to evaluate the company s performance and to make certain decisions relating to the optimal allocation of our resources 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered substitutes for performance measures presented in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in addition  we caution that the methodologies for the calculation of non gaap financial measures may vary from company to company and  therefore  non gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly named non gaap financial measures reported by other companies 
the tables below reconcile in thousands the following financial measures included  in this section that may be considered non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap adjusted operating income and adjusted net income

table of contents highlights operating results several factors impacted our business during most notably  we acquired document and records management vendor tower technology in march the tower technology acquisition combined with our heritage content management capabilities  our acquisition of portal vendor epicentric in december and our acquisition of collaboration vendor intraspect in december allows us to offer our customers a complete solution for the management and delivery of enterprise information 
our product offering now includes a complete set of product capabilities enterprise content management  portal and collaboration that are designed to support the information management and delivery needs of enterprises 
the expansion and ongoing integration of our suite of products added to our software and services capabilities and contributed to an increase in our revenues 
our revenues were also favorably impacted by renewed interest in enterprise content management software and our high levels of customer referenceability 
partially offsetting these positive factors was the continued difficult selling environment for enterprise software applications and the ramp up time required to successfully integrate our recently acquired companies 
in summary  these and other factors caused our revenues to increase by year over year to million in fiscal and quarter over quarter to million in the fourth quarter of more specifically  license revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were up and  respectively  as compared to maintenance revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were up and as compared to professional services revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were up and as compared to international revenue comprised and of total revenue for the year and quarter ended december   respectively 
no single customer accounted for more than of our annual or quarterly revenues 
the amortization of acquired technology related to our recent business combinations and the higher costs of supporting our expanded product offering caused our gross profit to decline to in from in total expenses  including both cost of revenue and operating expenses  for fiscal and for the fourth quarter of were million and million  respectively  and included million and million  respectively  for the following charges business restructuring charges  acquisition related charges  amortization of acquired technology and intangibles and the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
most of these charges relate to our previous acquisitions 
the remaining expenses of million for fiscal and million for the fourth quarter of were up and as compared to due primarily to our acquisitions of intraspect and tower 
in the fourth quarter of  we yielded an operating loss of million 
however  we reached a significant milestone in our company s history during the fourth quarter of with respect to non gaap operating results 
the combination of revenue growth and our continued cost control efforts yielded non gaap profitability from operations of million during the fourth quarter of  excluding the million in charges described above 
this compares to a profit of million during the fourth quarter of while we experienced improvement in business activity in the fourth quarter of  net losses worsened year over year as the fourth quarter improvement was not enough to offset the increased restructuring charges and the challenging market conditions that existed for much of the year of fiscal specifically  net losses were million  as compared to a net loss of million during fiscal excluding the charges totaling million as described above and charges for the write down of certain equity investments totaling million  net losses for fiscal were million 
this compares to net losses of million in fiscal in we expanded our restructuring plan 
in the first quarter we moved out of our existing headquarters and relocated to nearby office space that now serves as our headquarters 
we incurred additional restructuring charges in the first quarter in conjunction with the tower technology acquisition 
in the fourth quarter we reduced headcount worldwide  consolidated our software development activities and transitioned more of those activities to an offshore operations model  and realigned our sales organizational structure 
these actions caused us to incur restructuring charges of approximately million during the year 
we expect further charges of approximately million during the first and second quarters of 
table of contents our total cash and short term investments balance totaled approximately million as of december   and decreased approximately million from december   primarily due to our first quarter purchase of tower technology  restructuring and exit commitments  as well as net operating losses  excluding non cash charges 
we have no debt outstanding 
our headcount at december  was approximately  a decrease of from at december  and a decrease of from at september  the decrease was substantially the result of our operational restructuring 
outlook our objective is to maintain and extend our leadership position as a global provider of applications and products that enable organizations to harness the power of information and the web to deliver measurable improvements in business efficiency 
we will continue to focus on delivering sustained revenue and profitable growth  expanding our customer base of global organizations both at the enterprise and departmental levels  extending our technology and product leadership through internal investment in research and development  expanding our global sales capabilities and extending our partnership alliances with leading technology and services companies 
we will continue to improve sales force and channel productivity 
we will continue to encourage cross functional team selling through enhanced team realignment around customer accounts and regions  and meet market specific needs for designated solution areas through specialized teams with subject matter expertise in areas such as claims processing and compliance 
we will continue to focus on the indirect channel as a means to better distribute and expose our software and solutions to the marketplace 
we will also continue to focus on realizing efficiencies and cost savings across our business 
finally  excluding restructuring related outflows  we expect to achieve positive cash flows from operations during the first half of fiscal the primary risk to achieving our goals is competitive pressure  particularly from larger companies with much longer operating histories and greater resources 
moreover  many of these companies can adopt aggressive pricing policies and provide customers with consolidated offerings that may include some of our product capabilities 
other key risks include market acceptance of our products  the overall level of information technology spending  the uncertainties and challenges of offshore outsourcing and our ability to maintain control over expenses and cash 
our prospects must be considered in light of these risks  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  have completed several acquisitions and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
see risk factors that may affect future results for more information 
option exchange offer on september   we granted million stock options to employees who elected to participate in our stock option exchange program  a program designed to retain employees and to provide them with an incentive for maximizing stockholder value 
under the option exchange program  a total of million stock options  which were previously granted to the participating employees  were canceled on march   the cancellation date 
for employees who were not designated with vice president level titles on the cancellation date  the exercise price of these new options was  which was the fair market value of the company s common stock on the grant date 
for employees who were designated with vice president level titles on the exchange program s cancellation date  the exercise price of these new options was  which was the fair market value of the company s common stock on the exchange program s cancellation date 
the exchange program was organized to comply with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  and did not result in any additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting 
the company s senior executive officers and board of directors were not eligible to participate in this program 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed with and agreed upon the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long term investments  estimating business restructuring accruals  and valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
revenue recognition 
revenue consists of product and service fees 
product fee income is earned through the licensing or right to use our software and from the sale of specific software products 
service fee income is earned through the sale of maintenance and technical support  consulting services and training services 
we do not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of return  refundable fees  cancellation rights or acceptance clauses until such rights to return  refund or cancel have expired or acceptance has occurred 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements as revised by sab where software licenses are sold with maintenance or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements specific to us 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value  the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
revenue allocated to product license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  and collection of a fixed or determinable fee is probable 
we consider all payments outside our normal payment terms  including all amounts due in excess of one year  to not be fixed and determinable  and such amounts are recognized as revenue as they become due 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
for software arrangements where we are obligated to perform professional services for implementation of the product  we evaluate whether delivery has occurred upon shipment of software or upon completion of services and if the customer payment is probable of collection 
this evaluation is made based on various factors such as the nature of the services work  order type eg initial vs 
follow on  customer s payment history  etc 
in the instances where delivery is deemed not to have occurred upon shipment based on the aforementioned factors  license revenue is taken when we have no significant remaining obligations with regard to the implementation 
revenue from perpetual licenses that include unspecified  additional software products is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with the delivery of the first product 

table of contents revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue allocated to training and consulting service elements is recognized as the services are performed 
our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of our products as i such services are available from other vendors and ii we have sufficient experience in providing such services 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of revenue recognized 
accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
for example  in determining whether collection is probable  we assess our customers ability and intent to pay 
our actual experience with respect to collections could differ from our initial assessment if  for instance  unforeseen declines in the overall economy occur and negatively impact our customers financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices and in doing such  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit worthiness  customer concentrations  age of the receivable balance  both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
for example  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long term investments 
long term investments include investments in equity securities of both private and public companies and restricted certificates of deposit with original maturities in excess of one year 
long term investments are recorded at their estimated fair value 
we periodically analyze our long term investments for impairments considered other than temporary 
in performing this analysis  we evaluate whether general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole  or information pertaining to an investment s industry or that individual company  indicates that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
if so  we consider specific factors  including the financial condition and near term prospects of each investment  any event that may affect the investee company  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we record an investment impairment charge in the line item other income expense  net when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
business restructuring 
we vacated excess leased facilities as a result of the restructuring plan we initiated in and subsequently expanded in  and we recorded an accrual for the remaining lease liabilities of such vacated properties as well as brokerage commissions  partially offset by estimated sublease income 
we estimated the costs of these excess leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and sublease income  based on market information and trend analysis 
we continually assess our real estate portfolio and may vacate or occupy other leased space as dictated by our analysis 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate our accrual for facility lease commitments 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement  on january  in accordance with statement  we replaced the ratable amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets with a periodic review and analysis for possible impairment 
we assess our goodwill on october of each year and during an interim period if facts or circumstances would more likely than not suggest that the fair value of an identified reporting unit is below its carrying value 
there was no impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets in or 
table of contents accounting reclassification certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior period financial information to the current presentation 
these reclassifications had no effect on reported net losses 
the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and include the reclassification of auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments

table of contents total revenue increased in and in the increase in revenue for was primarily due to sales associated with the collaboration and document management products acquired in december and march  respectively  as partially offset by the continued weakness in the software industry and the ramp up time required to successfully integrate our recently acquired companies 
the increase in revenue for was primarily due to the sales of the portal product acquired in december and the introduction of new and upgraded products  as partially offset by the effects of slow information technology spending 
we expect total revenue across both license and services to grow in as we continue to gain momentum and traction from our consolidated product offerings 
product license 
product license revenue increased in and decreased in the increase in can be attributed primarily to sales of collaboration and document management products acquired in our december and march acquisitions  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to the effects of slow information technology spending  partially offset by the sales of portal product acquired in our december business combination and the introduction of new and upgraded products 
services 
services revenue increased in and the increase in maintenance and support as well as professional services revenue in is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of intraspect and tower technology 
the increase in was driven by higher maintenance and support revenue related to increases in our install base and consistent levels of maintenance renewals  partially offset by a decrease in professional services revenue 
professional services revenue was impacted in by fewer new product engagements and lower billing rates 
during  and  no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
international revenue was million  million and million  or   and of total revenues  in   and  respectively 
gross profit cost of revenue consists of costs to manufacture  package and distribute our products and related documentation  the costs of licensing third party software incorporated into our products  the amortization of certain acquired technology  and personnel and other expenses related to providing professional and maintenance services 
gross profit amounts and percentages are as follows year ended december  compared to compared to product license amortization of acquired technology maintenance and support professional services total services total gross profit as a percent of sales  gross profit represented   and in  and  respectively 
the decline in compared to is primarily due to the amortization of acquired technology related to our intraspect and tower technology acquisitions  the lower mix of license revenue as well as higher costs of supporting our expanded product offerings 
the improvement in was primarily due to the decrease in professional services costs related primarily to lower headcount 

table of contents operating expenses year ended december  compared to compared to research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges impairment of intangible assets business restructuring charges amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development 
research and development expenses increased in and decreased in the year over year increase in in absolute dollars relates to the timing of research and development efforts and the ramp up of certain offshore development activities  partially offset by other cost savings 
the decrease in research and development costs in compared to related primarily to our restructuring efforts that reduced engineering headcount and resulted in other cost savings 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  therefore  expect to continue to devote significant resources to our product development efforts 
further  we expect to balance future research and development investments with our objective of profitable growth 
we expect the consolidation of product development facilities and the transition of more of these activities to an offshore operations model to decrease our overall research and development expenses in software development costs capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  totaled million   million in  and  respectively 
these capitalized costs relate to software developed by third a party that was not acquired in a business combination 
they are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  generally months 
amortization expense was million  million  and million in  and  respectively  and is included in cost of revenue license on the consolidated statements of operations 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales  marketing and customer care personnel  sales commissions  public relations  marketing materials and tradeshows as well as bad debt charges 
sales and marketing expenses increased in and decreased in the increase in absolute dollars in compared to is attributable to increased commission expense and other variable costs resulting from higher product sales in as well as bad debt charges incurred primarily during the first quarter of the increase was partially offset by lower marketing costs resulting from restructuring and budget cuts 
the decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in compared to related primarily to our restructuring efforts that 
table of contents reduced headcount and resulted in other cost savings  lower commissions due to lower product sales  as well as reduced bad debt charges 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period due to the timing of new product releases and entry into new market areas  investment in marketing efforts and the timing of domestic and international conferences and trade shows 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for human resources  finance  accounting  facilities  information technology and legal employees 
general and administrative expenses increased in and decreased in the increase in absolute dollars in is attributable to the recent growth of our business and increased costs of meeting regulatory reporting requirements 
the decrease in absolute dollars in and relates primarily to our restructuring efforts that reduced headcount and resulted in other cost savings 
we expect general and administrative expenses in future periods to fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period based on regulatory requirements  legal proceedings and fees paid to outside professional service providers 
purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges 
during the three years ended december   we acquired a series of complementary businesses 
the following table summarizes costs related to our business combinations in thousands year ended december  purchased in process research and development cross training  product integration and other severance and other employee related costs contingent compensation included in the acquired net assets of epicentric  intraspect  and tower technology was purchased in process research and development ipr d efforts that we intended to substantially rework before integrating into our products in thousands acquired company acquired ipr d project description estimated fair value current status at december  epicentric foundation server allows rapid construction and delivery of interactive business portals application from this project has been fully integrated into our product intraspect intraspect collaboration solution that will simplify the integration between vignette portal and vignette business collaboration server 
modifications include rebranding user interface and other fixes and changes to support other application servers and web server combinations  application from this project is being reworked and is expected to be integrated into our product line within months 
tower technology tower idm collaborative document management functionality with process automation solutions and decentralization of configuration 
tower seraph provides document review workflows  case management and section compliance  application from this project is being reworked and is expected to be fully integrated into our product line within months 
the amounts allocated to ipr d were based on discounted cash flow models that employed cash flow projections for revenue based on the projected incremental increase in revenue that the acquired company expected to receive from the completed ipr d 
such assumptions were based on management s estimates and the growth potential of the market 
revenue for the projection periods assumed a compound annual growth rate of   and for epicentric  intraspect  and tower technology  respectively  and was adjusted to reflect the percentage of research and development determined to be complete as of the acquisition date 
cost of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense  and research and development expense were estimated as a percent of revenue based on each acquired company s historical results and industry averages 
these estimated operating expenses as well as capital 
table of contents charges and applicable income taxes were deducted to arrive at an estimated after tax cash flow 
the after tax cash flow projections were discounted using a risk adjusted rate of return  of and for epicentric and intraspect  respectively 
a risk adjusted rate of return ranging from to was employed for tower technology 
these discount rates were based on each acquired company s weighted average cost of capital of   and for epicentric  intraspect  and tower technology  respectively  as adjusted upwards for the additional risk related to the projects development and success 
the resulting ipr d was expensed at the time of purchase because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the efforts required to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that would be necessary to establish that the products could be produced to meet their design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the timing for the completion of such efforts was expected to range between twelve and eighteen months 
further  we were uncertain of our ability to complete the products within a timeframe acceptable to the market and ahead of competitors 
impairment of intangible assets 
we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in there was no impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets in or we use a two step approach to assess our goodwill annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
in  the value determined in step of the assessment  which involves comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit  indicated a goodwill impairment 
we estimated fair value based on market capitalization  as complemented by a discounted cash flow analysis  and as a result recorded a million charge 
the impairment was recorded in light of sustained negative industry and economic trends impacting current operations  the significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
the impaired goodwill was originally recorded in connection with the four business combinations effected during and such acquisitions were completed during a period when stock valuations for software companies were generally at much higher levels 
we measured the impairment loss by completing step during the fourth quarter of step involved determining the enterprise s implied fair value of goodwill 
the carrying amount of our goodwill was greater than the implied fair value of goodwill  resulting in full impairment of the remaining goodwill recorded in connection with our and business combinations 
also in  the datasage  inc trademark was impaired due to changes in product offerings 
such changes altered the packaging and marketing of certain technology and therefore rendered the related trademark obsolete  resulting in a million impairment charge 
we review other intangible assets for possible impairment periodically 
sustained negative industry and economic trends  a decline in our stock price and market capitalization for an extended period of time  or changes in our product offerings could result in future impairment charges that are material to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents business restructuring charges 
in  we initiated a restructuring program to align our expense and revenue levels and to better position us for growth and profitability 
in   and  we expanded those restructuring efforts 
although we have substantially implemented our restructuring activities  there can be no assurance that the estimated costs of our restructuring efforts will not change 
components of business restructuring charges and restructuring accruals are as follows in thousands facility lease commitments asset impairments employee separation and other costs total balance at december  total restructuring charge cash activity non cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity non cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity non cash activity balance at december  less current portion accrued restructuring costs  less current portion during we expanded the existing restructuring plan initiated in in the first quarter of  we moved out of our existing headquarters and relocated to nearby office space that now serves as our headquarters and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities statement 
in addition  we incurred severance and other real estate related expenses of approximately million resulting from our business combination with tower technology 
in the fourth quarter of  the board of directors authorized the company to effect additional job reductions 
the plan 
table of contents included a worldwide reduction in headcount of approximately personnel  including consolidating software development facilities in boston  massachusetts and san francisco  california into the company s other existing development facilities 
expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of as a result of this plan totaled approximately million  of which million related employee severance  benefits  and outplacement services  million related to real estate  and million related to the write off of leasehold improvements for vacated real estate 
expenses of approximately million for employee severance  million for real estate  and million related to leasehold improvement write offs are expected to be incurred in the first and second quarters of future cash expenditures associated with this action are expected to continue through and relate primarily to our lease obligations 
these are management s best estimates based on currently available information and are subject to change 
facility lease commitments relate to lease obligations for excess office space that the company has vacated as a result of the restructuring plan 
the company continues to actively pursue mitigation strategies to dispose of all excess office space through subleasing and or early termination negotiations where possible 
the total lease commitments include the estimated lease buyout fees  or the remaining lease liabilities and estimated associated mitigation costs including  but not limited to  brokerage commissions  legal fees  repairs  restoration costs  and sublease incentives  offset by estimated sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and any resulting sublease income  were based on market information and trend analysis as estimated by the company 
the company continually assesses its real estate portfolio and may vacate and or occupy other leased space as dictated by its analysis and by the needs of the business 
it is reasonably possible that actual results could continue to differ from these estimates in the near term  and such differences could be material to the financial statements 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate the company s accrual for facility lease commitments 
facility lease commitments relate to the company s departure from certain office space in austin  texas  brisbane and san francisco  california  new york city  new york  waltham and boston  massachusetts  chicago  illinois  slough  united kingdom  madrid  spain  and lane cove and melbourne  australia 
the maximum lease commitment of such vacated properties extends through december asset impairments relate to the impairment of certain fixed assets  prepaid royalties and intangible assets 
these fixed assets were impaired as a result of our decision to vacate certain office space and align our infrastructure with current and projected headcount 
employee separation and other costs include severance  related taxes  outplacement and other restructuring charges 
as a result of the restructuring activities  we have severed approximately  employees during the past three years 
employee groups impacted by the restructuring efforts include personnel in positions throughout the sales  marketing  professional services  engineering and general and administrative functions in all geographies 
during  we favorably resolved certain employee matters that related to our reduction in force 
this resolution resulted in a million decrease in the employee separation and other costs accrual 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
for stock options issued to employees  we record deferred compensation at the grant date if a difference exists between the exercise price and the market value of our common stock 
for restricted share issuances  we record deferred compensation equal to the market value on the issue date 
deferred stock compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting periods of the applicable options and restricted share grants 
amortization of deferred stock compensation is attributable to the following cost categories in thousands year ended december  cost of revenue services research and development sales and marketing general and administrative 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
intangible amortization expense increased in as compared to and decreased in compared to the increase in compared to relates to amortization expense for assets assumed from the intraspect and tower technology acquisitions 
amortization expense for these assets is recorded ratably over the estimates useful lives of the intangible assets  which range from two to six years 
the decrease in compared to relates to a change in the estimated useful life of technologies purchased as part of the ondisplay  inc acquisition 
due to changes in our product architecture and anticipated future product offerings  the estimated life of this acquired technology was reduced from four years to two years 
such technology was fully amortized at june  the year over year decrease in was offset partially by amortization attributable to million in assets acquired in the december epicentric acquisition 
amortization expense for these assets is recorded ratably over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets  which range from two to three years 
other income and expense other income and expense  net consists primarily of interest income and expense  recognized investment gains and losses as well as foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
year ended december  compared to compared to other income expense  net other income and expense declined in compared to primarily due to lower cash balances available for investment  a decrease in interest rates earned on those cash balances  and foreign exchange gains recognized in but minimized in with the implementation of a hedge program 
other income and expense improved in compared to primarily due to the impairment of certain long term investments in  as partially offset by decreasing yields on lower cash and short term investment balances 
the impaired long term investments generally consisted of redeemable convertible preferred stock in privately held technology companies as well as common stock in publicly held technology companies 
we periodically analyze our long term investments for impairments that are considered other than temporary 
as a result  we recognized impairment charges of million   and million in  and  respectively 
in the third quarter of  we adopted a foreign exchange policy to reduce our exposure to significant foreign currency fluctuations 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables 
at december   our unrestricted  long term investments totaled million 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of an investee could require future impairment charges 
provision for income taxes income tax expense consists primarily of estimated withholdings and income taxes due in certain foreign jurisdictions 
year ended december  compared to compared to provision for income taxes we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which includes net operating loss  capital loss and research tax credit carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning 
table of contents the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
quarterly results the table on pages f to f of the consolidated financial statements section sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of operations data  both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue  for each of the last consecutive eight quarters 
we base our forecast for expenses in part on future as opposed to historical revenue projections due to the continued changes in our business 
many of these expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if revenues are lower than we have projected 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly revenue is limited due to the long sales cycle of our software products  which makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which product implementation will occur  and the variability of customer demand for professional services 
we would expect our business  operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected if revenues do not meet projections and that net losses in a given quarter would be even greater than expected 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and we expect our operating results will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a number of factors are likely to cause these variations  including demand for our products and services  the timing of sales of our products and services  the timing of customer orders and product implementations  seasonal fluctuations in information technology purchasing  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web based applications  the mix of product license and services revenue  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our own staff or third party contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  global events  including terrorist activities and military operations  and the general economic climate  changes to our licensing and pricing model 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december   we had federal net operating losses carried forward  research and development carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  and million  respectively 
the net operating loss  credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards will expire at various dates  between and  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses  tax credits  and capital loss carryforwards in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of million at december  were incurred by businesses we acquired and will be subject to annual limitation 
these restrictions may severely limit the 
table of contents benefit of these tax attributes in future periods 
in addition  the remaining net operating loss of million  capital loss carryforward of million and research credit carryover of million may be subject to this limitation 
these restrictions may severely limit the benefit of these tax attributes in future periods 
as a result  substantial amounts of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may expire prior to utilization 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which include net operating losses carried forward  and research and development carryforwards  and capital loss carryforwards because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   the valuation allowance includes approximately million related to the acquisition of epicentric  intraspect  and tower technology net deferred tax assets 
the initial recognition of these acquired deferred tax asset items will first reduce goodwill  then other non current intangible assets of the acquired entity 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of acquired deferred tax assets as a reduction to goodwill 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward  substantially all of which  when realized  will be allocated directly to contributed capital to the extent the benefits exceed amounts attributable to compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial statistics and information  dollars in thousands december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital current ratio days of sales outstanding at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and no debt 
we invest cash exceeding our operating requirements in short term  investment grade securities and classify these investments as available for sale 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in operating cash outflows in was due primarily to changes in working capital  namely declines in restructuring and exit cash outflows 
the decrease in use in was due primarily to decrease in net losses  excluding non cash and restructuring charges  and changes in working capital 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
the increase in investing cash inflows in was due primarily to the maturity of our investments in marketable and auction rate securities  offset by purchase consideration for our acquisition of tower technology 
the increase in investing cash inflows in was due primarily to the maturity of our investments in short term marketable and auction rate securities  partially offset by purchase consideration for our acquisitions of epicentric and intraspect 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
our financing activities consisted primarily of employee stock option exercises and purchases of employee stock purchase plan shares 
our long term investments are classified as available for sale and generally consist of common stock in publicly held technology companies  limited partnership interests in a technology incubator  and cash 
table of contents collateral pledged for certain lease obligations 
at december  and  long term investments totaled million and million  respectively 
we may continue to invest in companies strategic to our business  however  we do not expect future investments to significantly impact our liquidity position 
at december  and  we had pledged million and million  respectively  as cash collateral for certain of our lease obligations 
these investments will remain restricted to the extent that the security requirements exist 
we expect our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances will increase in the near future 
we expect to fund our operations  capital expenditures and investments from internally generated funds 
we believe that our existing balances will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and investment requirements for at least the next months 
we may require additional funds for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public and private equity financings or from other sources 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us or that any additional financing will not be dilutive 
future minimum payments as of december  under our lease obligations  including operating lease commitments for all vacated properties  are as follows in thousands operating leases sublease income thereafter total minimum lease payments total minimum sublease rentals we do not have any significant contractual obligations other than those leases disclosed above 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standardsr  share based payment statement r  which is a proposed amendment to statement generally  the approach under statement r will require companies to recognize as compensation expense in the statements of operations the fair value of share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and the right to purchase shares under an employee stock purchase plan 
we are required to adopt statement r in the third quarter of fiscal the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under statement will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts  for fiscal through fiscal  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under statement r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
statement r permits adoption using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate all periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of statement r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under statement  we are evaluating the requirements under statement r  including the adoption methods and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income loss per share 
we expect to continue to grant stock based compensation to employees

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states of america and accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
we have operations throughout the americas  europe  asia and australia where transactions are denominated in the local currency of each location 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the third quarter of  we adopted a foreign exchange policy to reduce our exposure to significant foreign currency fluctuations 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated payables and receivables 
to date  we have not hedged forecasted transactions or firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
gains and losses on hedging contracts are reflected currently in other income and expense 
we typically limit the duration of our foreign currency forward contracts to days 
we do not invest in contracts for speculative purposes 
our foreign exchange exposures are monitored regularly to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
interest rate risk cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material interest risk exposure 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in obligations of the us government and its agencies  investment grade state and local government obligations  securities of us corporations rated a or p by standard poors or the moody s equivalents  and money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by us and non us commercial banks meeting certain credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than two years

our short term investments will mature in less than one year from december  and were invested in corporate notes  corporate bonds and medium term notes in large us institutions and governmental agencies 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at their estimated fair value 
long term investments 
we invest in emerging technology companies considered strategic to our software business 
at december   long term investments consisted of common stock held in publicly traded technology companies and a limited partnership interest in a technology incubator 
we periodically analyze our long term investments for impairments that could be considered other than temporary 
our investments in redeemable convertible preferred stock in privately held technology companies were fully impaired as of june  fair values were based on quoted market prices where available 
if quoted market prices were not available  we use a composite of quoted market prices of companies that are comparable in size and industry classification to our portfolio 
we classify our long term investments as available for sale and recorded a cumulative net unrealized gain of approximately million related to these securities at december  and we recorded a cumulative new unrealized loss of approximately million related to these securities at december  in addition to strategic investments  we held million and million in restricted investments at december  and december   respectively 
at december   restricted investments were composed of a certificate of deposit and investment grade securities placed with a high credit quality
