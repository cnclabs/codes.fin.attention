in thousands of dollars except for per share information 
forward looking statements certain of the matters and subject areas discussed in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of all statements other than statements of historical information provided herein are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements generally include words such as anticipates  expects  believes  intends  estimates  and similar expressions  and include those statements regarding our expectations  intentions and beliefs with regard to the future  including our efforts involving erp enterprise resource planning and crm customer relationship management system implementations  investments to develop rf products  conditions of the electronics industry  order cancellations  cost reduction efforts  general economic conditions  technology or other trends and known uncertainties 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those more fully described under the caption factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report 
these forward looking statements reflect management s analysis  judgment  belief or expectation only as of the date hereof 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
overview our business is to design  develop  manufacture and market complex electronic instruments and systems geared to the specialized needs of electronics manufacturers for high performance production testing  process monitoring  product development and research 
our primary products are integrated systems used to source  measure  connect  control or communicate electrical direct current dc  radio frequency rf or optical signals 
our customers are engineers  technicians and scientists in manufacturing  product development and research functions 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our orders were received from the semiconductor industry 
approximately percent came from research and education customers 
approximately percent came from the wireless communications customer group 
approximately percent came from the electronic components and subassemblies manufacturers customer group  which includes customers in automotive  computers and peripherals  medical equipment  aerospace and defense  and manufacturers of components  including optoelectronic components 
the remainder of orders came from customers in a variety of other industries 
although our products vary in capability  sophistication  use  size and price  they generally test  measure and analyze electrical  rf  optical or physical properties 
as such  we consider our business to be in a single industry segment 
many of the industries we serve  including but not limited to the semiconductor industry  the wireless communications industry  the optoelectronics industry  and precision electronic components and subassemblies manufacturers  have historically been very cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns 
during much of fiscal  conditions continued to negatively affect the worldwide electronics industry 
this caused a negative impact to our customers and  therefore  our results 
however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we noted an improved environment in the electronics industry 
during fiscal and  we noted improving conditions in the health of our customers 
however  we continue to believe that our ability to achieve a higher level of orders in the future will be driven by our customers spending patterns as they invest in new capacity or upgrade their lines for their new product offerings  as well as our ability to gain market share 
during the past several years our focus has been on building long term relationships and strong collaborative partnerships with our global customers for serving their measurement needs 
effective january   we began to sell our products in the united states through a direct sales force 
prior to january   we sold our products through sales representatives to whom we paid a commission 
the change in our sales channel allowed us to build a sales network of focused  highly trained sales engineers who specialize in measurement expertise and problem solving for customers and enhanced our ability to sell not only in the united states  but to us companies with foreign manufacturing operations 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we incurred approximately in one time costs as we paid both commissions to sales representatives and salaries to our own sales employees 
we have continued to build our direct sales force throughout the world and our ability to serve our customers has been aided immeasurably by deploying our own employees throughout the americas  europe and most recently asia 
we expect that selling through our own sales force will be favorable to earnings during times of strong sales and unfavorable during times of depressed sales as a greater portion of our selling costs are now fixed 
over the past few years we have incurred costs for the preparation and transition to new erp and crm software systems 
implementations that have occurred to date have caused minimal disruptions to our business  however  we will continue our erp and crm transitions in various locations throughout the world in fiscal and beyond 
the financial impact of the erp and crm projects was a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in  including depreciation expense of the software and other expenses that are not capitalizable under the accounting guidance 
included in capital expenditures was  and  in fiscal  and  respectively  related to the erp and crm systems 
during the last two years  the company continued to increase its investment in new product development  particularly for rf products  including opening a west coast development center in fiscal as we move forward into  we will be increasing our investment in product development activities to expand our measurement capabilities for the semiconductor and wireless industries 
we believe there are many opportunities to create sales growth through serving customers in these industries  and believe new products will drive our future growth 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management has identified the company s critical accounting policies 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the reported financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped under fob shipping terms 
upon shipment  a provision is made for estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties and sales returns 
when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on a currently adjusted standard  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we periodically review our recorded inventory and estimate a reserve for obsolete or slow moving items 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional reserves may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  our cost of sales will be lower than expected in that period 
income taxes keithley is subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of judgment by management 
judgment also is applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of federal  state and international pretax operating income  the reversal of book versus tax differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets has been established related to foreign tax credits and net operating losses which may not be realized due to the uncertainty of future profit levels or foreign source income 
we intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance  until such credits are realized or until such credits expire 
our income tax expense benefit recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance 
the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon forecasted future taxable income 
any significant reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in various tax jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues based upon our estimate of whether additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to income tax expense would result 
pension plan retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business representing obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as the rate of return on plan assets assumption is a long term estimate  it can differ materially from the actual return realized on plan assets in any given year  especially when markets are highly volatile 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that the rates we use are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the plans are effective  as well as the plans asset mix between equities and fixed income investments 
assumed discount rates are used in measurements of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations  and the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost 
the discount rate for the united states plan was determined as of the june  measurement date by constructing a portfolio of bonds with cash flows from coupon payments and maturities matching the projected benefit payments under the plan 
bonds considered in constructing the model portfolio are rated aa or higher by standard poor s 
callable bonds were excluded from consideration 
the longest maturity of any bond included in the data is february  benefit payments lying beyond were discounted back to that year using interest rates based on the citigroup pension discount curve as of june  because the united states plan s cash flows are larger in future years than they are currently  coupon payments from longer maturity bonds are in excess of what is needed to meet early period benefit payments 
the purchase 
table of contents price of the bond portfolio was adjusted by removing the value of the excess bond income  with such value based on prices of bonds with cash flows matching the excess amounts 
the discount rate used in determining the recorded liability for our us pension plan was for  compared to for and for the decrease in the rate was primarily due to lower interest rates on long term  highly rated corporate bonds 
actual rate of return on us plan assets was for compared to an expected rate of return of 
a increase decrease in the expected rate of return would have produced an decrease increase in expense 
management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions for both the us plan and non us plan based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the us and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
pension income or expense is allocated to cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses  and product development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
at the end of the fiscal year  the us pension plan s funded status reflected  of unrecognized actuarial loss  including  in experience loss that will not be subject to recognition in determining expense 
the excluded portion is due to differences between expected and actual investment returns on the current measurement date and the preceding three measurement dates 
such losses are made subject to recognition at a rate of per year until fully included 
the remaining loss of  which is due to changes in data  assumption changes including discount rate and previously recognized asset gains or losses  is subject to recognition based on the corridor method 
any amount falling outside of the corridor is divided by the average future working lifetime of active participants to determine the amount recognized in expense 
stock compensation plans we have two active stock option plans and an employee stock purchase plan 
we have chosen the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  and as such  no compensation cost for the stock option and stock purchase plans has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements  except in certain cases when stock options were granted below the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant or variable accounting is required under applicable accounting guidance 
for disclosure purposes  the valuation of stock issued to employees requires management to determine estimates for the expected life of the options  the expected risk free interest rate during the expected life of the option  the expected volatility of the stock price over the expected life of the option  and the expected dividend yield 
these estimations are significant factors in the valuation model  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we currently use the black scholes model to value options 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no

results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data included in item of this annual report 
percent of net sales for the years ended september net sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses product development expenses severance charges operating income loss investment income interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net income for was  or per diluted share compared to  or per share for the net loss was  or per share in including the establishment of a tax valuation allowance in the income tax provision of  or per share  and severance charges of pretax  or per share after taxes 
net sales were  in compared with  in and  in net sales increased one percent in from the effect of a four percent weaker us dollar on net sales was negligible 
net sales increased in from approximately four percentage points of the percent increase were due to the effect of a weaker us dollar 
the downturn in the electronics industry  which began in  had a negative effect on results into throughout and  we noted improving conditions in the health of our customers and the 
table of contents electronics industry as a whole 
geographically  sales were up in asia  down nine percent in europe and down eight percent in the americas during in  sales were up in the americas  in asia  and up in europe from cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was  and in  and  respectively 
a favorable product mix in was more than offset by higher sales discounts  which raises cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales  and by higher other manufacturing costs due to our investment in the manufacturing design engineering organization  as well as higher manufacturing variances 
the improvement in over was due to spreading fixed manufacturing costs over higher sales volume  lower manufacturing costs as a result of the progress we made in fine tuning our lean manufacturing process and improved product mix 
foreign exchange hedging had a minimal effect on cost of goods sold in  and selling  general and administrative expenses of  increased one percent in from  in  and increased in from  in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were  and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in over was due primarily to higher costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance  higher salaries and fringe benefits and higher costs outside the us due to the weaker dollar  offset by lower incentive costs tied to financial performance 
the increase in over was due primarily to higher incentive costs due to our strong financial performance in fiscal additionally  the weaker us dollar increased costs in europe and japan 
product development expenses of  increased from  in  and increased in from  in product development expenses as a percentage of net sales were  and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in was due primarily to higher personnel related costs  project consultants  and development supplies for our continued investment in the development of new products  as well as the full year impact of our west coast rf development group 
the increase in from was due primarily to the investment in our west coast rf development group and higher incentive costs 
during fiscal  we recorded pretax  or 
per share after taxes  for severance charges relating to a reduction in force of individuals  or less than of the worldwide work force 
the majority of the individuals were in sales or sales support functions 
the charge included salaries and vacation pursuant to each individual s severance agreement  payroll taxes  health insurance and pension costs 
cash payments of  and were made for severance in  and  respectively 
at september   was included in the accrued payroll and related expenses caption of the consolidated balance sheets related to severance 
all remaining liabilities under these agreements were paid in see note j 
interest income was  in  in and in higher interest rates and higher average cash and short term investment balances accounted for the increase in over lower interest rates and lower average cash and short term investments levels accounted for the decrease in from interest expense was in  in and in the decrease in from was due primarily to favorable mark to market adjustments on the company s interest rate swap agreement 
the tax rate for fiscal was  compared to the prior year s rate of 
the rate was lower than the statutory rate as a result of extraterritorial income exclusion benefits  r d credit utilization and changes in state deferred taxes 
the rate was below the statutory rate due mainly to the extraterritorial income exclusion benefit and r d credit utilization 
we recorded a tax benefit for at a effective rate 
the benefit was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain tax credits where we determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related to those credits would not be realized see note i 
our financial results are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
generally  a weakening us dollar versus foreign currency favorably impacts our foreign currency denominated sales 
a strengthening us dollar has an unfavorable effect 
this foreign exchange effect cannot be precisely isolated since many other factors affect our foreign sales and earnings 
these factors include product offerings and pricing policies of keithley and our competition  whether competition is foreign or us based  changes in technology  product and customer mix  and local and worldwide economic conditions 
we utilize hedging techniques designed to mitigate the short term effect of exchange rate fluctuations on operations and balance sheet positions by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts 
we do not speculate in foreign currencies or derivative financial instruments  and hedging techniques do not increase our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  at september  short term investments increased  to  at september  cash and short term investments were used to purchase  of property  plant and equipment  to pay  in dividends  to contribute  to the united states pension plan  and to fund the working capital needs of our business 
we had no debt at september   a decrease of from september  the company s credit agreement  which expires march   is a  debt facility outstanding at september  that provides unsecured  multi currency revolving credit at various interest rates based on prime or libor 
we are required to pay a facility fee of on the total amount of the commitment 
additionally  the company has a number of other credit facilities in various currencies and for standby letters of credit aggregating  outstanding at september  
at september   we had total unused lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks aggregating  of which  is long term and  was a combination of long term and short term depending upon the nature of the indebtedness 
under certain provisions of the debt agreements  we are required to comply with various financial ratios and covenants 
we were in compliance with all such debt covenants  as amended  at september  and during each of the three years then ended 

table of contents our current stock repurchase program expires on december  under the current program we may repurchase up to  common shares through december  the current program replaces a prior program that expired in december during  we expect to finance capital spending  working capital requirements and the stock repurchase program with cash and short term investments on hand and cash provided by operations 
capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to approximate  to  set forth below is a table of information with respect to the company s contractual obligations as of september  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years short term debt operating lease obligations payments under deferred compensation agreements a pension benefit b b b b total contractual obligations a includes amounts due under a deferred compensation agreement with a retired executive 
amounts exclude additional interest that will be earned from september  through the time of payment 
other executives and directors are included in this plan  however  as retirement dates are uncertain  they are excluded from the above table 
b the obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of september  the company made its pension contribution of  in fiscal  and as such does not have a required contribution due in fiscal we are not able to reasonably estimate our future required contributions beyond due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans  including interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns  what  if any  changes may occur in legislation  and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions

the company s assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
those variables include  but are not limited to  the company s stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the company will recognize the compensation cost for the stock based awards issued after september  over the requisite service period for the entire award 
the company will adopt this statement using the modified prospective application method 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

this statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  as such  the pronouncement is effective beginning with the company s fiscal year although early application is allowed 
in december  the fasb issued two staff positions fsp fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  for the tax deduction provided to us based manufacturers by the american jobs creation act of  and fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp fas clarifies that the tax deduction for domestic manufacturers under the american jobs creation act of the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fsp fas will begin to impact the company in our fiscal year 
management is currently evaluating the provisions of the pronouncement to identify the impact on the company 
fsp fas provides enterprises more time beyond the financial reporting period during which the act took effect to evaluate the act s impact on the enterprise s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
the company has historically repatriated dividends from our foreign subsidiaries  therefore  this provision of the american jobs creation act provides no benefit to the company 
as such  fsp fas did not impact our consolidated financial statements for fiscal in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations to clarify the guidance included in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fin requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if amounts cannot be reasonably estimated  certain disclosures will be required about the unrecognized asset retirement obligation 
currently the company is not involved in asset retirement obligations  however  the provisions of fin will be applied to any of these transactions if so entered beginning in fiscal factors that may affect future results statements included in the sections entitled business  overview  recent accounting pronouncements and liquidity and capital resources of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements  as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements generally include words such as anticipates  expects  believes  intends  estimates  and similar expressions 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected including those discussed below 
except as otherwise required by applicable securities laws  the company disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
many of the industries we serve  including but not limited to the semiconductor industry  the wireless communications industry  the optoelectronics industry  and precision electronic components and subassemblies manufacturers  have historically been very cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns 
the downturns have had  and may have in the future  a material adverse impact on our customers demand for equipment  including test and measurement equipment 
the severity and length of a downturn also may affect overall access to capital  which could adversely affect the company s customers 
in addition  the factors leading to and the severity and length of a downturn are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will appropriately anticipate changes in the underlying end markets we serve or that any increased levels of business activity will continue as a trend into the future 
in addition  our orders are cancelable by customers  and consequently  orders outstanding at the end of a reporting period may not result in realized sales in the future 
if we fail to appropriately manage our cost structure to reallocate resources to areas that will provide the best long term benefits to our customers and shareholders  our reporting results will be adversely affected 
for instance  we may not be able to reduce our manufacturing costs  while increasing our product development investments for rf technologies  and we may experience unfavorable shifts in product mix or reductions in demand for a product that limits our ability to spread manufacturing costs over higher sales volume 
our business relies on the development of new high technology products and services  including rf products  to provide solutions to our customers complex measurement needs 
this requires anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging technology trends 
we must make long term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our expectations will eventually result in products that achieve market acceptance 
we incur significant expenses developing new products that may or may not result in significant sources of revenue and earnings in the future 
if these expenses do not result in future earnings  our operating results will be adversely affected 
in many cases our products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers 
if any of our competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost effective or technically superior  demand for our product offerings could slow 
our products contain large quantities of electronic components and subassemblies that in some cases are supplied through sole or limited source third party suppliers 
as a result  there can be no assurance that parts and supplies will be available in a timely manner and at reasonable prices 
additionally  our inventory is subject to risks of changes in market demand for particular products 
our inability to obtain critical parts and supplies or any resulting excess and or obsolete inventory could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we currently have subsidiaries or sales offices located in countries including the united states  and non us sales accounted for approximately two thirds of our revenue during fiscal our future results could be adversely affected by several factors relating to our international sales operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  political unrest  wars and acts of terrorism  changes in other economic or political conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and natural disasters 
any of these factors could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

table of contents we implemented a lean manufacturing initiative in our manufacturing facilities  which are located in solon  ohio 
we may not experience future benefits if we are unable to continue to effectively fine tune this initiative  and we could incur additional costs in the future  having a negative impact on gross margin  if new initiatives are needed to further improve manufacturing and execution efficiencies 
we pay taxes in several jurisdictions throughout the world 
we utilize available tax credits and other tax planning strategies in an effort to minimize our overall tax liability 
our estimated tax rate for fiscal could change from what is currently anticipated due to changes in tax laws of various countries  changes in our overall tax planning strategy  or countries where earnings or losses are incurred 
at september   we had a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets and had not established valuation allowances against other deferred tax assets based on tax strategies planned to mitigate the risk of impairment to these assets 
accordingly  if facts or financial results were to change thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  our tax rate and therefore our earnings could be adversely affected 
throughout fiscal and fiscal  we have continued our implementation of erp and crm systems 
our results could be adversely affected if we are unable to further implement systems without significant interruptions in accounting systems  order entry  billing  manufacturing and other customer support functions 
we have continued to build our direct sales force throughout the world with our own employees rather than through sales representatives 
this action increased our fixed costs  and our results could be adversely affected during times of depressed sales 
other risk factors include  but are not limited to  changes in our customer and product mix affecting our gross margins  credit risk of customers  potential litigation  claims  regulatory and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business  as well as terrorist activities and armed conflicts 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations  interest rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its short term investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rates 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we currently utilize foreign exchange forward contracts or option contracts to sell foreign currencies to fix the exchange rates related to near term sales and effectively fix our margins 
generally  these contracts have maturities of three months or less 
our policy is to only enter into derivative transactions when we have an identifiable exposure to risk  thus not creating additional foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in our opinion  a percent adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on these instruments nor therefore  on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting of united states government backed notes and bonds and corporate notes and bonds 
an increase in interest rates would decrease the value of certain of these investments 
however  in management s opinion  a percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company also had an interest rate swap instrument originally entered into to mitigate the risk of interest rate changes related to long term debt 
the agreement effectively fixed the interest rate on a notional  of variable rate debt  however  the interest rate swap instrument was determined to be an ineffective hedge and accordingly  changes in the fair market value of the interest rate swap were recorded in the company s records as income or expense 
the instrument expired september
