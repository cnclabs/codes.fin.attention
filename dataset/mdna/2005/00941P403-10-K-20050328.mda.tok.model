we provide base stations and other wireless telecommunications infrastructure products designed to support the gsm  or global system for mobile communications  system of mobile voice and data transmission 
we market our products worldwide to operators of wireless networks and to certain governmental and public safety organizations 
a base station is a key component of a wireless network that receives and transmits voice and data signals over radio frequencies 
we designed our base stations to be easier to deploy and upgrade and to have lower operating costs than other existing base stations 
product overview 
our system features six innovative base station products adaptacell base station 
our adaptacell base station is a software defined base station  meaning it uses software to control the way it filters  encodes or decodes wireless signals 
our adaptacell base station incorporates a patented broadband  software defined  radio architecture that is designed to enable operators to upgrade their wireless networks to offer high speed data and internet services by changing software with few  if any  hardware modifications rather than deploying new base stations 
our adaptacell base station also incorporates a broadband architecture  meaning that it uses only one radio to process a large number of radio channels simultaneously 
adaptive array supercapacity base station 
the broadband architecture of our flagship adaptacell base station makes it the ideal platform to deliver integrated software algorithms that will permit the addition of an adaptive array antenna feature 
adaptive array technology focuses radio signals on individual handset antennas instead of spreading the signals over the entire cell covered by one base station 
it also blocks the strongest interference  which significantly increases performance  capacity and high speed data rates 
the airnet adaptive array super capacity base station provides network operators with a potentially compelling value proposition 
the adaptive array technology  licensed by airnet from arraycomm  inc  improves capacity  call quality  and high speed data performance while reducing the number of cell sites required by up to a factor of x 
in order to support capacity deployments on traditional wireless systems  operators must re use their spectrum 
this re use of spectrum creates additional voice channels but inherently increases interference  degrading the quality of service provided by the network 
in contrast  the airnet supercapacity base station utilizing adaptive array processing reduces interference  improves voice quality  conserves signal power by focusing and receiving energy only in desired locations  and increases capacity 
the adaptive array product was first commercially deployed in in a voice only mode 
we expect to add adaptive high speed data functionality in rapidcell base station 
our rapidcell base station is a miniaturized version of the adaptacell base station 
the airnet rapidcell base station is about the size of a large suitcase and can support up to gsm carriers traffic channels configured for rapid deployment for use by emergency first responders or governmental agencies 
the rapidcell base station is a ruggedized rapidly deployable  secure wideband base station that solves the problem of getting a reliable communication system up and running quickly 
in addition to a stand alone mode  our rapidcell base station can be connected to gsm core infrastructure either directly or via satellite allowing for ubiquitous connectivity for standard gsm handsets nearly anywhere in the world 
rapidcell can also support ip and voip packet data interfaces with only a software upgrade 
airsite backhaul free base station 
the airsite backhaul free base station carries voice and data signals back to the wireline network without using a physical wired communications link 
our airsite backhaul free base station uses an operator s existing radio frequencies as the media to provide the necessary connection to the wireline network 
unlike our competitors base stations  our airsite backhaul free base station does not require an expensive physical communications link  usually through a digital t e telephone line or microwave  to the wireline network 
as a result  an operator s fixed network operating costs may significantly decrease 

table of contents ibss 
traditional gsm networks are composed of base station subsystems bss and network subsystem nss 
airnet produces a bss which is composed of several different platforms such as the adaptacell base station  base station controller  pcu and trau 
the specified signaling interface between the bss and the nss is called the a interface 
the a interface is based on the signaling system ss for several signaling layers 
the ss signaling is a connection oriented  circuit switched protocol 
airnet has developed a software feature for the adaptacell and rapidcell that transforms the bts into an entire bss network including bts  trau  bsc and future pcu 
rather than utilize circuit switched ss protocols  this ibss product utilizes an ip based connection oriented protocol that is equivalent to the a interface 
the ibss can be utilized in networks that have a soft msc function in their nss which implement the corresponding interface 
the result for the customer is a dramatic reduction in size and cost of the network elements 
the ibss continues to also support the airsite  so it can be the building block for an extremely cost effective rural  coverage wireless mobile telephone network 
alternately  the ibss functionality can be utilized to create a distributed bsc concept for capacity networks 
direct link enables direct connection of the adaptacell or rapidcell base station to a pri enabled pbx or central office exchange 
the broadband  sdr platform helps airnet eliminate the need for costly network elements such as the msc and bsc so that wireless operators can provide a highly reliable  rapidly deployable community cordless network 
the network can easily be expanded using airsite backhaul free base stations and later upgraded to the full mobility of gsm whenever business conditions permit 
market overview 
like other wireless infrastructure suppliers  we have experienced the adverse effects of the global downturn in telecommunications infrastructure spending 
we have historically relied upon an integrated suite of infrastructure products for all our sales a product line that was optimized to meet the needs of the initial coverage and coverage limited segments of the wireless infrastructure market 
competition has become extremely intense in the coverage product market with these products being priced as commodities resulting in margin compression 
in response  we undertook a major restructuring starting in mid to better leverage our technology base and entrepreneurial culture to target new market opportunities for our gsm products 
we have redirected our activities to focus on three applications for our products we have developed our adaptive array supercapacity base station for high capacity voice and g high speed data markets for example gprs and edge  our traditional gsm infrastructure  including the adaptacell base station and the airsite backhaul free base station  serve wireless markets that require a coverage based solution  and the growing market for secure  adaptable wireless infrastructure for governmental and public safety applications is served by our compact  rapidly deployable rapidcell base station 
the government and public safety market includes radio communications needs for local  state  federal as well as foreign governmental agencies 
our rapidcell base station and airsite products provide flexible and unique communications platforms capable of supporting these applications 
we continue to make progress in the development of our supercapacity base station utilizing adaptive array technology 
this new base station is built on our current software defined adaptacell base station platform by integrating adaptive array technology and was commercially released in adaptive array technology dramatically increases the operators spectral efficiency resulting in tremendous increases in network performance at a reduced cost 
this is accomplished by focusing transmitted radio signals on individual handset antennas instead of spreading them over the entire cell and by deliberately not broadcasting radio signals toward detected co channel users 
this technology also cancels or blocks the strongest interference in the receiver 
this new base station is designed to benefit operators in the transition from current wireless standards to the new gprs providing high speed wireless data in packet format and enhanced data rates for gsm evolution or edge  providing yet higher speed standards 
several customers  potential customers  and wireless experts have repeatedly participated in drive testing our multi cell gsm network utilizing the airnet supercapacity base station 
the test demonstrated multiple  adjacent adaptive array cell sites with multiple co channel interferers  and demonstrated a frequency re use scheme of n incorporating high speed handovers 
n frequency re use implies the re use of the same frequency channel in adjacent cells and is an important feature for network operators because it affords a significant increase in network capacity by allowing simultaneous multiple users on the same timeslot  on the same frequency  in adjacent cells 
this is otherwise not possible in traditional gsm networks 
this feature enables previously unattainable capacity improvements and dramatically reduces the need to add cell sites in order to meet increasing subscriber counts and higher speed data requirements  such as edge 
we plan to market the enhanced frequency re use feature by targeting gsm carriers who are faced with limited spectrum in many markets  need to increase capacity  and or are introducing edge into their networks 
we believe this product will provide the company with an entry into the largest operators worldwide because of its ability to efficiently utilize spectrum 
there are risks associated with new product introductions and some of these risks are outlined in the risk factors set forth in item below and elsewhere in this document 

table of contents our portfolio of broadband software defined radio or sdr technology and our entrepreneurial tradition lend themselves to exploiting numerous new opportunities in the wireless arena 
we believe these new opportunities driven by recent developments both inside and outside the company  offer a tremendous potential for growth and success 
sdr technology allows us to readily reprogram our wireless infrastructure products to address new markets and new opportunities in a cost effective manner 
the development and acceptance of sdr technology in the marketplace has created new opportunities for us outside our core industry 
due to our significant portfolio of basic sdr intellectual property  it is now possible for us to explore licensing our technology in a variety of applications to third parties or other strategic relationships 
the adaptacell product architecture utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ofdm which  we believe  is becoming the de facto standard for many broadband systems including wimax 
the adaptacell supercapacity base station could  in the future  offer service providers a software reconfigurable solution for the wimax e mobile high speed data standard 
the company joined the wimax forum in the wimax forum is chartered to set consistent wimax standards for all equipment manufacturers to utilize and ensure interoperability 
our timeline to introduce this product is undetermined at this time 
we continue to develop and exploit leading edge technology and as of december   we had domestic and foreign patents granted as well as domestic and foreign patent applications pending 
we received the gsm world award for best technical innovation from the gsm association  an international body with members from over countries  in recognition of our innovative infrastructure 
on october   we received certification under the iso standard 
iso is the globally recognized standard for quality management systems qms aimed at consistently producing and delivering the highest quality products and services necessary to achieve complete customer satisfaction 
to date  we have continued to obtain recertification on an annual basis 
on march   we were awarded the tl certification by the quality of excellence for suppliers of telecommunications quest forum 
the certification is valid for the design  production  sales and service of wireless voice and data communications equipment solutions 
products our base station subsystem products currently support the gsm system for wireless voice and data communications services 
we chose to develop products based on this standard because it is the leading accepted standard in the world and because the interfaces  or connections  between the various pieces that make up the gsm base station subsystem are well defined open interfaces and publicly documented 
according to the gsm association  gsm subscribers exceeded billion worldwide in the first quarter of one of these interfaces  the connection between the mobile switching center msc and the base station controller bsc  and ultimately the base stations that compose the base station subsystem  is referred to as the a interface 
this a interface allows wireless operators to connect our base station subsystem equipment to an existing operator s mobile switching center 
it is this standard interface that makes any existing gsm operator a potential customer for our base station subsystem equipment 
we are currently marketing the base station subsystem in four standard configurations  the gsm  gsm  gsm  and gsm  operating at mhz  mhz  mhz  and mhz respectively 
our products have been deployed with customers using the following msc providers nortel  alcatel usa sourcing alcatel  lucent  nokia  siemens  tecore  spatial wireless  and telos utstarcom 
our base station subsystem features six unique base station products the adaptacell broadband  software defined base station  the adaptive array supercapacity base station  the rapidcell base station  and the airsite backhaul free base station along with core base station subsystem products of the base station controller bsc  a transcoder rate adaption unit trau  an operations and maintenance center radio omcr 
we also offer for sale certain other network products manufactured by others mobile switching center msc  serving gprs support node sgsn  and gateway gprs support node ggsn 
adaptacell base station the adaptacell wireless base station supports up to gsm radio frequency carriers total channels including voice data channels and four control channels for up to pairs of antennas sectors 
the adaptacell base station differs from our competitors base stations in that its operation is defined by software  not hardware 
this means that  as subscribers demand new services from operators specifically new high speed data and internet services  it will be possible to upgrade the adaptacell base station to support those services via a change of software and few  if any  hardware modifications 
operators using our competitors equipment may have to install new equipment and potentially a completely new base station for each new wireless standard that they adopt

rapidcell can also support ip and voip packet data interfaces with only a software upgrade 
airsite backhaul free base station the airsite backhaul free base station is a compact wireless base station that includes its own wireless backhaul system 
by contrast  other existing base stations must be connected to the rest of the system using expensive physical communications links  usually digital t e telephone lines or microwave 
the airsite backhaul free base station is a full featured gsm base station  meaning it has a unique cell id for billing and emergency identification purposes  offers the same geographic coverage as other existing base stations  and has configuration  fault  and error detection integrated into the operations and maintenance center radio 
the airsite backhaul free base station operates by receiving a subscriber s wireless telephone signal and transmitting it to the adaptacell base station 
the adaptacell base station then sends the signal over a t e line or microwave link to the base station controller and on to the mobile switching center 
in reverse  digitized voice signals come from the mobile switching center to the base station controller and then to the serving adaptacell base station  which then transmits the signal to the airsite backhaul free base station 
the airsite backhaul free base station then transmits the signal to the subscriber

the network can easily be expanded using airsite backhaul free base stations and later upgraded to the full mobility of gsm whenever business conditions permit 
base station controller our base station controller bsc coordinates the activities of the adaptacell base stations physically attached to it and to all the airsite backhaul free base stations served by those adaptacell base stations 
among other things  the bsc monitors the operational status of each of its attached base stations and orchestrates handoffs between base stations 
to support packet data services ie gprs and egprs the bsc incorporates an optional packet control unit pcu 
the pcu manages distribution of packet data to and from gprs enabled mobile units via the base stations attached to the base station controller and gprs network components  namely the sgsn serving gprs support node and ggsn gateway gprs support node 
transcoder rate adapter unit in most telecommunications systems  digitized voice requires kbps of bandwidth to accurately convey human speech 
our transcoder rate adapter unit trau compresses a standard kbps voice stream to a gsm standardized kbps 
this means that the digital t e telephone line or microwave link used to connect the base station controller to the mobile switching center can carry four times as many voice conversations as it normally would 
this makes it less expensive to attach a base station subsystem to its associated mobile switching center 
additionally  airnet has developed software to support adaptive multirate amr speech coding 
this feature increases voice capacity of gsm networks while maintaining the current high levels of voice quality 
operations and maintenance center radio the operations and maintenance center radio omcr provides the network management facility for one or more of our base station subsystems 
our operations and maintenance center radio provides a comprehensive graphical user interface for maintenance personnel 

table of contents in addition to the previously described products  airnet also provides for sale certain gsm network components manufactured by others in order to provide complete voice and data systems to our customers 
these include the msc  sgsn  and ggsn 
mobile switching center the msc interfaces to one or more base station controllers via the a interface  previously mentioned 
this msc provides mobility management and switching to connect a caller on a mobile unit to a caller on another mobile unit or a caller on the wireline public switching telephone network pstn 
the msc supports other functions such as authentication of mobile subscribers to prevent fraud 
additionally  the msc supports features familiar to users of telephone systems such as call forwarding  call waiting  call conferencing  etc 
the msc may also interface to voice mail systems  short message service centers smsc  billing systems or other mobile switching centers 
serving gprs and edge support node the sgsn provides a mobility management function that tracks a gprs mobile from one base station to another in order to route data packets to and from the mobile subscriber 
the sgsn interfaces to the pcu in the base station controller and to the ggsn 
additionally  the sgsn supports other functions such as authentication of gprs mobile subscribers as well as provides information on mobile subscriber usage for billing purposes

together these three customers accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year 
see note in notes to financial statements for financial information regarding our customers 
our international sales approximated million or of total revenue 
during the year ended december    or million  of our total sales were made to the us government  either directly or via a leading defense contractor 
sales and marketing our worldwide sales and marketing efforts are conducted through a network of original equipment manufacturers  or oems  agents  resellers and our direct sales force 
we currently have a staff of six in sales and sales support 
sales in the north american pcs market may be impeded due to roaming considerations  decreased capital spending  and msc price performance issues 
because our direct sales force is small  our worldwide sales strategy depends primarily on the use of oem partners to sell our products and to increase our revenue 
we currently have five key oem partners tecore  alcatel  two undisclosed oem partners which will concentrate on rapidcell sales  and a regional oem partner reseller  electronia  located in the middle east 
in  approximately of our revenue was generated from our oem partners  with being generated from our direct sales force 
we expect the oem partner content of our revenue to increase further in we have established a marketing communications organization that is responsible for the branding and marketing of our products and services and for distinguishing the adaptacell base station  the adaptive array supercapacity base station  the rapidcell base station  and the airsite backhaul free base station as branded product offerings 
the marketing organization is responsible for all new product launches to ensure internal execution and to promote marketplace acceptance 
research and product development we spent million in  million in and million in on research and product development 
as of december   of our employees were engaged in research and product development  including hardware and software engineering 
we expect to hire additional employees to engage in research and product development during in order to staff projects funded by both strategic partners customers and the company 
was a productive year for our engineering staff 
the first adaptive array and edge systems were deployed 
we developed a lower cost outdoor base station  ibss software feature for the adaptacell and rapidcell bts platforms functionality  and released a significantly upgraded omcr software suite 
our current product development plans focus on continuing adaptive array technology development for our super capacity base station  edge  rapidcell  and end of life component considerations and features for major operators by taking advantage of the evolution of digital signal processors and other digital components to reduce the cost of our base stations 
we may not be able to introduce these or any other products as scheduled 
in addition  market conditions may not necessitate developing upgrade packages to support one or more of these emerging advanced high speed data standards 

table of contents manufacturing and backlog we currently use a limited number of third party contractors to manufacture most of our primary components and subassemblies for our products 
as a result  our in house customer fulfillment operations consist primarily of quality control  final assembly  and product integration and testing 
circuit boards  electronic and mechanical parts  and other component assemblies are purchased from oems and other selected suppliers 
an in house staff sets standards and monitors the quality control of our contract manufacturers 
the majority of our proprietary radio frequency rf assemblies are currently built by a top tier contract manufacturer 
our contract backlog was approximately million at december  as compared to million at december  we typically include a contract in backlog when signed by the customer and a deposit is received from the customer  if required by the contract 
the amount of our backlog is subject to fluctuation based on the timing of the receipt and completion of orders 
the amount generally consists of orders shippable within one year and deferred revenue from products that have been shipped to customers but have not yet satisfied all significant terms and conditions of the customer contract as well as revenue from contracts with vendor financing arrangements which extend beyond one year 
such conditions include completion of installation and customer acceptance of product technical performance 
see note of notes to financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policy 
our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
competition the wireless telecommunications infrastructure market is highly competitive 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry wireless standards  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
failure to keep pace with these changes could seriously harm our competitive position and prospects for growth 
our ability to compete depends on many factors including product and standard flexibility  price  operating cost  and reliability 
we have been negatively impacted by the reduction in global demand for telecommunications infrastructure equipment 
as a result of the reduction in global demand  our competitors have been bundling mobile switch centers mscs together with base stations at deeply discounted pricing levels 
these actions are targeting our traditional customer base and have resulted in intense price performance competition 
this price competition has substantially reduced opportunities for us to expand or continue sales of coverage solution products to small medium sized personal communications service pcs operators in north america 
current and potential competitors consist primarily of major domestic and international companies  most of which have longer operating histories  larger installed customer bases  higher volumes  substantially greater name recognition  and greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and distribution resources 
competing base station vendors can be divided into two groups existing large equipment manufacturers who supply a complete range of wireless base station systems to wireless service operators and smaller companies that typically market components of wireless systems to system suppliers or directly to operators 
our current competitors include alcatel sa  lm ericsson telephone company  lucent technologies inc  motorola  inc  nec corporation  nokia corporation  nortel networks corporation and siemens ag 
we also face actual and potential competition from start up and smaller companies that develop and market new wireless telecommunications products and services 
proprietary rights we consider our technologies proprietary and seek to protect our intellectual property rights 
as of december   we had domestic and foreign patents granted as well as domestic and foreign patent applications pending 
one of the issued domestic patents was based upon proprietary rights originally obtained from harris corporation  one of our stockholders  and is subject to a non exclusive cross license to a third party 
our patents cover the basic architecture of the system  sub components  and frequency reuse planning schemes 
simultaneously with motorola s equity investment in january  we signed an agreement granting motorola the right to obtain a non exclusive  royalty free license under any two of our patents 
with respect to any possible infringement of our respective digital base station patents  each of us agreed not to enjoin the other and to attempt dispute resolution  including negotiation of non exclusive license agreements in good faith  before resorting to litigation 
while we believe that our patents will render it more difficult for competitors to develop and market similar products  our patents may be invalidated  circumvented  or challenged 
our patent rights may fail to provide us with competitive advantages 
any pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged by applicable governmental patent examiners  may not be issued with the scope we seek 
we also rely upon copyright and trade secret laws 
source code for our own proprietary software is protected as an unpublished copyrighted work  as a trade secret  and for certain customers the source code is escrowed 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our rights  it may be possible for a third party to copy or to obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization 
we may have to pursue litigation in the future to enforce our proprietary rights or to defend against 
table of contents claims of infringement and such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we are not engaged in any legal proceedings concerning matters of patent infringement or enforcement  however  we are presently involved in a few minor legal proceedings involving rights in our airnet trademark 
in addition  others may develop technologies superior to our technology  duplicate our technology  or design around our patents 
government regulation our products must conform to a variety of requirements and protocols 
in order for our products to be used in certain jurisdictions  regulatory approval may be necessary 
the delays inherent in this regulatory approval process may cause the rescheduling  postponement or cancellation of the installation of telecommunications systems by our customers  which  in turn  may significantly reduce sales of products to such customers 
the failure to comply with current or future regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations in a particular country could result in the suspension or cessation of sales in that country  restrictions on our development efforts and those of our customers  render current products obsolete  or increase the opportunity for additional competition 
such regulations or such changes in interpretation could require us to modify our products and incur substantial costs to comply with such regulations and changes 
products to support new services can be marketed only if permitted by frequency allocations and regulations 
in most cases  we only plan to qualify our products in a foreign country once we have a purchase order from a customer located there  and this practice may deter customers or contribute to delays in receiving or filling orders 
employees as of december   we had employees 
of these individuals  were in research and product development 
we also retain independent contractors from time to time 
we have not had a company wide raise in employees salaries in  and however  increases were authorized by the compensation committee for  although to date  none have been granted 
in january we postponed the payment of bonuses to employees and suspended the company matching contributions to the k plan  both of which may create an impediment to the retention of our key employees 
during the second quarter of  our board of directors approved payments of one half of the previously postponed bonuses which were paid to employees ratably over the last six months of the remaining one half of the bonuses  approximately thousand  may be paid at the discretion of our board of directors during december of none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
however  we cannot guarantee retention of key employees due to the issues noted above 
one half of the employee stock options with an exercise price of per share issued in august september vested in august september and the remaining options will vest in august september vesting may impact our ability to retain key employees 
reverse stock split in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a for reverse stock split  effective december   in which stockholders received one share of common stock  and cash resulting from the elimination of any fractional share  in exchange for each ten shares of common stock outstanding on the record date 
the reverse stock split had previously been approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting of stockholders 
unless otherwise noted  share amounts and per share amounts including exercise or conversion prices of options  warrants or convertible securities in this annual report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the reverse stock split 
item properties our headquarters consist of approximately  square feet of space leased through december   located at dow road in melbourne  florida 
the space also houses our primary manufacturing and product engineering operation 
additional space of approximately  square feet at the trio complex in melbourne  florida  is leased through december  for final assembly and testing 
we believe that these facilities will be adequate to meet our requirements at least through and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available if needed 
item legal proceedings the company  two of our former officers and members of the underwriting syndicate involved in our initial public offering have been named as defendants in a class action complaint filed on november  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the action  number mc sas  alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and certification of a plaintiff class consisting of all persons and entities who purchased  converted

more than similar class action lawsuits filed in the southern district of new york have been consolidated for pretrial purposes under the caption of in re initial public offering securities litigation 
on july   a joint motion to dismiss was filed by the defendants 
in february  the motion to dismiss was granted in part with respect to the company and denied in part with respect to all issuer defendants 
the claims against our two former officers named in the class action lawsuit have been dismissed without prejudice  pursuant to agreement 
the issuer defendants and the plaintiffs have since drafted and agreed upon a settlement  which is pending approval by the court 
a committee of the company s board of directors has accepted the pending settlement 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the defendant issuers insurers have agreed to pay the plaintiffs the amount of one billion dollars less the total of all of the plaintiffs recoveries from the underwriter defendants 
furthermore  pursuant to the agreement  the issuer defendants have assigned all their potential claims against the underwriter defendants to a litigation trust  to be represented by plaintiffs counsel 
on february   the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement 
the court s approval is contingent on certain modifications of the settlement provisions concerning a bar on claims of contribution 
under the terms of the settlement  there would be no liability to be recorded by the company 
pursuant to a separate agreement  the insurers have also agreed to pay the issuers defense costs incurred on or subsequent to june  on a pooling basis 
furthermore  pending approval  the individual tolling agreements dismissing the named individual defendants have been extended  so that the individual defendants will be covered by the settlement as well 
final approval of the settlement remains pending before the court 
while awaiting final court approval of the settlement  the issuers  including the company  have complied with discovery obligations specified in the settlement  by providing a limited number of documents 
in the event that the settlement is not approved  the company intends to defend vigorously against the plaintiffs claims 
moreover  while the company does not know whether the claims of misconduct by the underwriters have merit  the company has claims under the underwriting agreement against the relevant underwriters of the ipo for indemnification and reimbursement of costs and any damages incurred in connection with the matter  and the company intends to pursue those claims vigorously as well in the event that the settlement is not finally approved 
in addition to the item listed above the company is also involved in various claims and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
with respect to the above matters  the company believes that it has adequate legal defenses and or provided adequate accruals for related costs such that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position or results of operation

results of operations overview we provide base stations and other wireless telecommunications infrastructure products designed to support the gsm system of mobile voice and data transmission 
we have substantial intellectual experience in the wireless industry and products and market our products worldwide to operators of wireless networks 
a base station is a key component of a wireless network and is used to receive and transmit voice and data signals over radio frequencies 
our products include the adaptacell base station  a software defined base station  meaning it uses software to control the way it encodes and decodes voice and data wireless signals  and the airsite backhaul free base station  which carries voice and data signals back to the wireline network without using a physical communications link 
these products are continually evolving 
for example  our product line now also includes our adaptive array supercapacity base station  using adaptive array technology to focus radio signals on individual handset antennas instead of spreading signals over the entire cell covered by one base station  and our rapidcell base station  a miniaturized version of our adaptacell base station configured for rapid deployment for use by emergency first responders or governmental agencies 
from our inception in january through may  our operations consisted principally of start up activity associated with the design  development  and marketing of our products 
we did not generate significant revenues until and have generated only million in net revenues from our inception through december  we have incurred substantial losses since commencing operations  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
as we continue to build our customer and revenue base we expect to continue to incur net losses at least through we will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to support research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  and to achieve and maintain profitability 
we are likely to require additional funding in the near future  and there is no guarantee that such funding will be available to us 
see liquidity  capital resources  and going concern considerations below 
we began marketing our gsm base stations in the beginning of and shipped our first gsm base station in may through december   our base stations had been deployed in twenty seven networks 
we currently sell and market our products in the us through our direct sales force 
internationally  we sell our products through our direct sales force  as well as through agents and oems 
our revenues are derived from sales of a product line based on the gsm standard 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers  with three customers accounting for of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended december  for the fiscal years ended december    and  our revenue from direct sales to international customers was  and  respectively 
in addition  revenue from oem sales for international deployments were  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we experienced a significant period of transition 
in mid  management undertook a strategic review of the business and established the following objectives for the future simplify the business  reduce the cost structure and move towards the path to long term sustainable profitability 
in connection with these objectives  we took action to reduce costs and discretionary expenditures  negotiated settlements with vendors on existing accounts payable balances  undertook efforts to better leverage our technology base and entrepreneurial culture to target new market opportunities  and redirected our activities to focus in the following interrelated areas the growing market for secure  adaptable wireless infrastructure for governmental and public safety applications  
table of contents our adaptive array technology for our adaptacell supercapacity base station  and our traditional gsm infrastructure market 
while market demand continues to be uncertain  we believe our strategy and new direction offer the most stable and attractive opportunities for us 
these four areas are interrelated and address the same basic market  that is  the wireless infrastructure market 
we have had and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenues as a result of our long and variable sales cycle 
historically  our sales cycle  which is the period from the time a sales lead is generated until the recognition of revenue  has ranged up to eighteen months in time 
the length and variability of our sales cycle is influenced by a number of factors beyond our control  including our customers build out and deployment schedules  our customers access to product purchase financing  our customers degree of familiarity with our products  the need for functional demonstrations and field trials  the manufacturing lead time for our products  delays in final acceptance of products following shipments  regulatory developments  and our revenue recognition policies 
the effect of our potentially long sales cycle on our results is compounded by our current dependence on a small number of customers 
in general  our gross margins will be affected by the following factors demand for our products and services  new product introductions  both by airnet and our competitors  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  the mix of base stations and other products sold  the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  engineering cost reduction successes  access to the best vendors from a cost and technology viewpoint  the mix of domestic and international sales  and the volume pricing we are able to obtain from contract manufacturers and third party vendors 
we currently obtain all of our primary components and subassemblies for our products from a limited number of independent contract manufacturers and purchase circuit boards  electronic and mechanical parts and other component assemblies from a limited number of oems and other selected vendors 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to these suppliers 
the remainder of our cost of revenues is related to our in house manufacturing operations  which consist primarily of quality control  procurement and material management  final assembly  testing  and product integration 
research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred in the design  development and support of our proprietary technology 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in as we further the development of our core technology 
research and development associated with future products will depend on customer requirements 
we may  however  incur costs in connection with the development of the software needed to upgrade our base stations to support emerging wireless high speed data transmission standards 
the cost incurred for software development performed by third parties through development agreements are carried on the balance sheet as an intangible asset until the product is deployed 
subsequent to deployment the cost is amortized over the estimated useful life of the product 
refer to note of notes to financial statements for a detailed discussion 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  consulting fees  trade show expenses  advertising  marketing expenses and general support costs 
we intend to maintain expenditures for selling and marketing in order to support distribution channels  strategic relationships  sales and marketing personnel  a x customer service center  rf services  field service support  and marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses for finance  office operations  administrative and general management activities  including legal  accounting  human resources  and other professional fees and loss provisions for uncollectible receivables 
restatement as described more fully in note in notes to financial statements  we have restated certain items for the last two fiscal quarters of fiscal  the first three fiscal quarters of and the fiscal year ended december   with respect to the timing of our recognition of certain non cash interest charges resulting from the beneficial conversion feature of our august convertible note financing 

table of contents related party transactions see item regarding a description of related party transactions during contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years over years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations other purchase obligations and commitments long term debt obligations total includes purchase obligations that are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as we have not yet received the material or taken title to the property 
also includes commitments remaining on our edge software licensing agreement as described in note in notes to financial statements 
includes principal balance on security purchase agreement notes million as of december   accrued interest million on the principal balance of the notes as of december   and related future interest million to be accrued from january  through the maturity date of august   assuming no future conversion of notes to common stock 
also includes deferred accrued interest on the bridge loan of  and accrued interest on this amount through its maturity date of august    see note in notes to financial statements 
certain remaining obligations under our agreement with arraycomm see note in notes to financial statements are not included above as they are contingent upon the shipment of supercapacity base stations  which cannot be estimated at this point 
as of december   we have shipped supercapacity base stations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenues for the year ended december  increased million or to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was largely attributable to increased revenues from three of our oem partners alcatel usa sourcing  tecore and a leading aerospace and defense contractor 
the oem partner revenue gains were partially offset by reduced feature development revenue 
the revenue generated from oem partners orders included our first large north american operator sale to dobson and the deployment of two new products adaptive array supercapacity and rapidcell base stations 
during the year ended december   adaptive array and rapidcell accounted for or million of our revenue 
service revenue  which includes feature development revenue  decreased million during the year ended december  to million compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   million of our revenue was generated by three customers 
we recognize the need for revenue growth to obtain profitability and achieve positive cash flow from operations 
based on our gross profit rate and taking into account a series of expense reduction efforts and product cost initiatives  we estimate that we would need revenue of approximately million per quarter in order to achieve a positive cash flow from operations 
achievement of these revenue levels would require a substantial increase over previous years revenues 
to address the need for revenue growth  we shifted our selling strategy in from a direct sales strategy to relying primarily on oem partners to sell and distribute our products 
to date  we have signed non exclusive oem agreements with five oem partners alcatel usa sourcing  tecore  electronia and two large defense contractors 
because we have a direct sales and marketing staff of only six employees  oem partners revenue is critical to our survival 
revenue generated by oem partners was million of total revenue and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have projected our business plan the plan revenue at million with our current distribution channels 
our revenue projection for our adaptive array and rapidcell base station products exceeds million for as of december   we had revenue backlog of approximately million 
our historical sales results and our current backlog do not give us sufficient 
table of contents visibility or predictability to indicate when the higher sales levels might be achieved  if at all 
our plan contains aggressive targets and there can be no assurances that these targets can be met 
for example  our plan makes certain assumptions about new adaptive array contract awards  and if these contracts are not awarded to us  our revenue may be significantly less than our plan projects 
even if we meet these higher revenue levels  revenue will fall well under the million per quarter that we estimate we would need to achieve positive cash flow from operations 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased million to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the gross profit margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
equipment margins increased to in from in due mainly to sales of adaptive array and rapidcell base station products which yield higher profit margins than our traditional commodity and coverage products 
service margins were flat at approximately in both and the increase in the total gross profit for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to higher revenue volume  which accounted for million of the increase  improved equipment margins  which contributed million  improved warranty experience  which resulted in a million net decrease in the warranty expense  and a million decrease in the write down of excess or obsolete inventory 
we expect supercapacity adaptacell and rapidcell base station product revenue to increase in so our annual plan reflects increased product margins in however  future market conditions and economic conditions could affect the achievement of this margin objective 
cost of revenues also includes million of non cash stock compensation expense in versus  in research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased million or to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the million of non cash stock compensation expense in compared with million in and increased labor costs of million 
increased labor costs were the result of our efforts to increase engineering headcount to accelerate development of new product features 
the foregoing was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense in the amount of million as the result of a portion of our equipment becoming fully depreciated during our annual plan projects research and development costs to trend downward due primarily to an expected decrease in non cash stock compensation expense from million in to million in  offset by an anticipated increase in labor costs resulting from our continuing effort to accelerate development 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased million or to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a million increase of non cash stock compensation expense 
we are expecting sales and marketing costs to continue trending upward in since anticipated increased revenue should result in increased sales commissions 
the sales and marketing related portion of the non cash stock compensation expense is expected to decrease from million in to million in general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million or to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase is primarily due to an increase in the non cash stock compensation expense of million associated with the stock options granted to employees 
we expect general and administrative expenses will decrease in as the general and administrative portion of the non cash stock compensation expense is expected to decrease from million in to million in total other expense total other expense for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to million of additional expense in resulting from the beneficial conversion feature associated with the convertible debt financing described in note in notes to financial statements and interest charges associated with the convertible debt 
as a result of the conversion feature embedded in the notes  which permits the conversion of the debt into our common stock at any time at a specified conversion price  we record the intrinsic value of the conversion feature as a discount  limited to the total cash proceeds received from the funding which is amortized as interest expense over the life of the note or upon conversion of the note 
during  million of notes were converted into common stock resulting in a million charge associated with that conversion 
in addition  for the year ended december   the interest associated with the notes increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to the increased average annual balance of the note outstanding in as compared to 
table of contents significant non cash charges which affected our net loss attributed to common stockholders in and were as follows non cash conversion charge the million conversion charge recorded in the third quarter of resulted from the inducement charges associated with the conversion of our series b convertible preferred stock into common stock 
this charge resulted in a loss attributable to common stockholders of million taking into account the value of the  paid to each of mellon ventures  lp mellon and tandem pcs investments  lp tandem  the shares of common stock issued to scp private equity partners ii  lp scp ii  and the shares of common stock issued to the holders upon conversion 
the million note financing see note in notes to financial statements was conditioned upon voluntary conversion by the holders of series b convertible preferred stock 
the holders converted their preferred shares to common stock at a conversion price of per share half of the effective conversion price but well above the original note conversion price of per share  effectively waiving their full ratchet anti dilution adjustment rights and giving up all of their rights and privileges as preferred stockholders  including their liquidation preferences 
the series b holders who converted their preferred shares into common stock also waived accrued dividends in the aggregate amount of million 
there was no conversion charge in non cash stock compensation expenses stock compensation expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  these charges are reflected as compensation expense and are included in the operating expenses as engineering  sales and marketing  general and administrative or cost of revenues based on the department in which the employee who receives the stock options is working see note in notes to financial statements 
during  we amended our stock option plan with the approval of our stockholders 
under the amended plan the number of options available for grant was increased to  also during  we granted  options at an exercise price of per share to our employees 
the granting of these stock options to employees resulted in non cash deferred compensation of million to be amortized ratably over the two year vesting period ending in september as of december   the balance of deferred compensation was million that will be amortized over the first three quarters of non cash debt conversion interest charge as a result of the beneficial conversion feature embedded in the notes  which permits the conversion of the debt into our common stock at any time at a specified conversion price  we recorded the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature as a discount  limited to the total cash proceeds received from the funding  and are amortizing the deferred charge over the life of the note with accelerations of any unamortized expense upon conversion of the note 
during  million of notes were converted into common stock resulting in a million charge associated with that conversion 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was largely attributed to completion of a project in central asia  which accounted for million of the revenue and a project in africa  which accounted for million of the revenue for the year ended december  compared to million and million  respectively for the year ended december  the million reduction in revenue associated with these two projects was partially offset by a million increase in customer funded development revenue 
during revenue trends were mixed 
domestic hardware revenues were down  customer funded development and services revenue trended up and international revenues trended down primarily because of the completion of the central asia project 
gross profit gross profit decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the gross profit margin was for and for the increase in the gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a shift in the composition of business to more service and customer funded development revenues 
cost of goods sold also includes approximately  of non cash stock compensation expense 
research and development research and development expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to million of research and development resources being redirected to work on direct cost of sales activities 
in addition there was a decrease in labor of million including benefits  bonus accrual of million  use of outside services of million and a decrease in other departmental activities of million 
the expenses included million of non cash stock compensation expense in compared with in during the fourth quarter of  in an effort to accelerate development of new product features  we began to increase engineering headcount 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million reduction included million of labor that was redirected to work on direct cost of sales activities  a million reduction in labor and benefit costs  a million reduction in travel expenses and million reduction in demonstration equipment 
the expenses for the year ended december  included million of non cash stock compensation expense in compared with in general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expenses was primarily attributable to non cash compensation expense of million recognized for the year ended december  compared to in also  reflected a million reduction in expenses due to the recovery of receivables previously accounted for in the provision for doubtful accounts 
these expenses were partially offset by reductions in other areas 

table of contents gain on vendor settlements we recorded a gain on vendor settlements of  during and none during total other expense total other expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to million of interest charges in which resulted from the beneficial conversion feature associated with the convertible debt financing see note in notes to financial statements and million reduction in other interest income expense 
conversion inducement charge this non cash charge resulted from inducement charges associated with the conversion of our series b convertible preferred stock by each of the three holders of that series of preferred stock mellon  tandem and scp ii 
this charge resulted in an increase in the loss attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  refer to the above discussion for details liquidity  capital resources  and going concern considerations the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business  and  as a consequence  the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
we have experienced net operating losses and negative cash flows since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
cash used in operations and to fund capital expenditures for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
we expect to have an operating loss in at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and the final million installment payment associated with the senior secured convertible debt funding  which we received march  see note in notes to financial statements 
such conditions raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without receiving additional funding 
as of march  our cash balance was million and during the year to date through march   we have received an additional million in new orders  in addition to our contract backlog at december  of million 
our current operating plan projects that cash available from planned revenue combined with the million on hand at march  may be adequate to defer the requirement for new funding until the second half of there can be no assurances that new financing can be secured at a reasonable cost  if at all 
our future results of operations involve a number of significant risks and uncertainties 
the worldwide market for telecommunications products such as ours has seen dramatic reductions in demand as compared to the late s and it is uncertain as to when or whether market conditions will improve 
we have been negatively impacted by this reduction in global demand and by our weak capital structure 
other factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary from expectations include  but are not limited to  ability to raise capital  dependence on key personnel  dependence on a limited number of customers with three customers accounting for of our total revenue for  our ability to address large customer expectations and product defects  our ability to design new products  the erosion of product prices  our ability to overcome deployment and installation challenges in developing countries which may include political and civil risks and risks relating to environmental conditions  product obsolescence  our ability to generate consistent sales  our ability to finance research and development  government regulation  technological innovations and acceptance  competition  our reliance on certain vendors and credit risks 
our ultimate ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time will depend on increasing our revenues and or reducing our expenses and securing enough additional funding to enable us to reach profitability 
our historical sales results and our current backlog do not give us sufficient visibility or predictability to indicate when the required higher sales levels might be achieved  if at all 
it is likely that we will be required to discontinue operations if we are unable to obtain additional funding or dramatically reduce our expenditures which would significantly reduce our ability to compete 
it is unlikely that we will achieve profitable operations in the near term and therefore it is likely our operations will continue to consume cash in the foreseeable future 
we have limited cash resources and therefore we must reduce our negative cash flows or secure additional funding in the near term to continue operations 
obtaining additional funding would require the approval of our senior note holders  and would likely be subject to additional conditions  and there can be no assurances that we will be able to find such financing even if our senior note holders would permit it 
likewise  there can be no assurances that we will succeed in achieving our goals and failure to do so in the near term will have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results and our ability to continue as a going concern 
as a consequence  we may be forced to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws 
in that event  it is unclear whether we could successfully reorganize our capital structure and operations  or whether we could realize sufficient value for our assets to satisfy fully the debt to the holders of our senior notes  in accordance with securities purchase agreement described in note in notes to financial statements  or to any other holders 
accordingly  should we file for bankruptcy  there is no assurance that our stockholders would receive any value 

table of contents we have engaged a financial advisor to assist us in identifying and evaluating strategic business options 
these options include  but are not limited to  i seeking strategic partners and or strategic investors and ii a business combination or acquisition 
considering the uncertainty regarding our ability to materially increase revenue or significantly reduce expenses  our cash requirements for will likely exceed available cash resources 
as a result of this condition  management is continuing to evaluate private equity pipe funding options 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
on january   we entered into a bridge loan agreement the loan agreement  with tecore  inc  a texas corporation tecore  and scp private equity partners ii  lp  a delaware limited partnership scp ii  which together with tecore  we call the lenders  pursuant to which each of the lenders agreed to loan us up to million collectively  the commitments or bridge loans  for an aggregate interim financing of million 
we were allowed to draw down the balance of the commitment at our discretion upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the loan agreement 
the annual interest rate on the bridge loans was plus prime rate as quoted in the wall street journal 
the bridge loans were due on may  but the due date was extended until the closing of the million investment the investment by the lenders discussed below 
on june   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with tecore and scp ii the purchase agreement for the issuance and sale to scp ii and tecore of senior secured convertible notes the notes in the principal amount of million 
the notes are collateralized by a security interest in all of our assets  including without limitation our intellectual property  in favor of the lenders under the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement 
on august  our stockholders approved the investment under the purchase agreement and related transactions  and the investment closed on august  on that date  we issued notes of million and million to scp ii and tecore  respectively  and immediately received million in proceeds million each from scp ii and tecore 
upon the closing of the investment  the principal balance of the bridge loans million was due and paid from the proceeds of the investment 
the interest accrued on these bridge loans was deferred by the lenders and will be due and payable four years from the closing date under the purchase agreement 
the interest at the rate of per annum will compound on the amount of interest deferred under the bridge loans 
the remaining million purchase price for the note issued to tecore was payable in quarterly installments of million each  with the first installment originally scheduled for june being paid at the closing 
on march   we received the final installment on the note from tecore 
on april   we closed on a private placement with several institutional investors the investors which resulted in the issuance of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants the private placement warrants to purchase  shares including warrants to purchase  shares issued to the placement agent of common stock at an exercise price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
issuance costs associated with the private placement approximated  pursuant to the registration rights agreement we entered into in connection with the private placement  we registered for resale all shares of common stock issued or issuable under the private placement  including the shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants  under a registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission and declared effective on june the private placement warrants became exercisable on october   have a five year term  contain a cashless exercise option available only in limited instances and carry certain anti dilution rights 
at december   private placement warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were outstanding at an exercise price of  which expire on october  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was approximately million in  million in and million in for the year ended december  cash was provided through a reduction in inventories which was attributed to the fulfillment of customers orders  an increase in accounts payable resulting from increased sales in the fourth quarter of versus the same period of  and an increase in other liabilities primarily attributed to an increase in deferred interest associated with the notes see note in notes to financial statements 
the foregoing was offset by cash used through an increase in accounts receivable from increased sales in compared to  decreases in other accrued expenses mainly resulting from partial payments made on employee bonuses see note in notes to financial statements  decreases in both customer deposits and deferred revenue as a result of significantly lower backlog as of december  million compared to million  and the net loss incurred 
for the year ended december  the cash provided through customer deposits and a reduction in inventories was offset by an increase in accounts receivable  decreases in accounts payable and deferred revenue  and the net loss incurred 
during the year ended december  the use of cash in operating activities resulted from the net loss  which was offset by a significant reduction in inventories and accounts receivable 
the million increase in the use of cash from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was attributable to reductions in inventories and accounts receivable in that were not matched in 
table of contents except for sales to oems or to customers under agreements providing for acceptance concurrent with shipment  our customers are billed as contractual milestones are met 
deposits ranging up to of the contracted amount typically are received at the inception of the contract and an additional percentage of the contracted amount is generally billed upon shipment 
the terms vary from contract to contract but are always agreed to in the initial contract 
most of the remaining unbilled amounts are invoiced after a customer has placed the products in service  completed specified acceptance testing procedures or has otherwise accepted the product 
collection of the entire amounts due under our contracts to date have lagged behind shipment of our products due to the time period between shipment and fulfillment of all of our applicable post shipment contractual obligations  the time at which we bill the remaining balance of the contracted amount 
this lag will require an increase in investments in working capital as our revenues increase 
net cash used in investing activities we used net cash in investing activities of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
commencing in and continuing through  we significantly reduced the level of capital expenditures from prior year levels  as our physical assets available were adequate to meet our needs 
our capital expenditures for testing and manufacturing equipment used during final assembly of our products will increase if our revenues increase 
we lease our primary manufacturing and office facilities under long term non cancelable operating leases 
we also have operating leases for certain other furniture  equipment and computers 
we used net cash for operating leases of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
future minimum payments for operating leases aggregated through the year were approximately million as of december  and we expect to spend approximately million for those leases in net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million which was derived from million in proceeds from installment payments on the notes discussed above and in note in notes to financial statements and million in net proceeds primarily from the issuance of common stock and warrants resulting from the private placement discussed above 
as of december   we have been advanced a total of million on the notes  the lenders have converted million of the principal on the notes into our common stock  and million principal amount of the notes remains outstanding plus accrued interest 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  the final installment payment on the notes of million was received on march  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million which primarily resulted from the receipt of the initial million in proceeds on the notes see note to notes to financial statements 
in addition we collected million from an outstanding non recourse loan with our ceo 
the non recourse loan was paid in full with accrued interest in september net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million resulting primarily from the payments on capital leases of million 
we had no debt facilities outstanding as of december  we lease certain computer and test equipment under capital lease arrangements 
we used net cash for capital leases of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
future minimum payments for capital leases aggregated through the year were approximately  as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized after delivery and determination that the fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable  and after the resolution of uncertainties regarding satisfaction of significant terms and conditions of the customer contract 
revenue for sales to oems is recognized when title to the product passes to the oem 
typically  for these product sales  title passes to the customer at the point of shipment 
we recognize revenue from service agreements on a straight line basis unless our obligation is fulfilled in a different pattern  over the contractual term of the arrangement 
revenue on certain long term projects is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
the cost incurred to date is taken as a percentage of the estimated cost at completion and this percentage is used to compute revenue on an inception to date basis 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the future financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance is reduced when a customer which previously was deemed a collection risk makes payments to us  eliminating the need for the allowance  or when a receivable is written off 
warranty and customer support we offer one year warranties for the products that we sell which generally provides for a basic limited warranty  including parts and labor for any product deemed to be defective 
actual warranty costs are charged to expense as incurred 
generally  we estimate the warranty costs that may be incurred in the future based largely on the ratio of historical warranty costs in relation to revenue recognized in the corresponding period 
the resulting liability is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted accordingly 
factors that may affect the warranty liability include the number of products sold and historical and anticipated warranty claims 
accounting for inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write offs may be required beyond the write off that was previously taken 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
long lived assets totaled million as of december  including licensing and software development costs 
upon our determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge or loss 
unsuccessful product marketing or continued substantial operating losses could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  and therefore might require an impairment charge in the future 
stock based compensation in december the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of statement no 
statement 
statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement and accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about our method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we previously adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement and continue to measure compensation costs for stock options issued to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  compensation expense is not recognized when the exercise price is the same as the market price 
a stock option is considered compensatory if the exercise price of the option is less than the fair market value of the stock on the measurement date  which is the date all terms of the grant are finalized normally the grant date 
the intrinsic value of an option is the excess of the fair market value of the underlying stock over the exercise price of the options  which the company recognizes using the straight line method over the vesting period of the options 
if we had elected to recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options to our employees and directors based on the fair value method of accounting prescribed by statement  net loss and loss per share would have been increased to the pro forma amounts as follows for the year ended december as restated net loss attributable to common stock  as reported add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss deduct pro forma fair value stock compensation expense pro forma net loss attributable to common stock net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted  as reported net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted  pro forma recent pronouncements in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments to be based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an 
table of contents employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the statement is effective for the first interim period that begins after june  the company is currently evaluating the two methods of adoption allowed by sfas r  the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method and has yet to determine what effect the adoption of this statement will have on its financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is not expected to have a material impact on the company 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the amendment eliminates the exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
under apb  accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset is to be based upon the recorded amount of the asset relinquished carryover basis with no gain or loss recognition 
the transaction will now be accounted for based upon the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the statement is effective for exchanges occurring in fiscal years beginning after june  and is to be applied prospectively 
this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company 
status of our common stock listing on nasdaq national market under continued listing standard one nasdaq rule a  companies listed on the nasdaq national market are required to have net tangible assets of million  total stockholders equity of million  and a minimum bid price of at least per share or a minimum bid price of at least per share with no net tangible asset requirement 
in the absence of additional equity financing  it is possible that our stockholders equity may drop below the million requirement under continued listing standard one rule a during fiscal year there can be no assurance that the nasdaq will permit us to continue our listing on the nasdaq national market or transfer to the nasdaq smallcap market if we cannot show a definitive plan for maintaining the stockholders equity requirement 
we can not give investors in our common stock any assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with minimum standards for continued listing on nasdaq national market or the nasdaq smallcap market and that the liquidity that nasdaq provides will be available to investors in the future

forward looking statements often include words or phrases such as will likely result  expect  will continue  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  project  outlook or similar expressions 
these statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of future performance 
they are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
actual results may vary materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect our management s view only as of the date of this report 
we are not obligated to update these statements or publicly release the results of any revisions to them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
certain risk factors  which could cause actual results to differ from expectations  are set forth below 
we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect our results of operations 
risk factors you should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this annual report in evaluating our business and our prospects 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business and financial results could be harmed 
in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report  including our financial statements and the related notes 
we have incurred significant losses since we began doing business 
we anticipate continuing losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we have accumulated losses of million since we began doing business in through december   
table of contents and we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we will need to generate significantly higher revenues to achieve and sustain profitability 
since we began doing business in  we have generated million in net revenues through december  we have been marketing our gsm base stations since we have never reported a profit and have only had quarters in which we obtained a positive cash flow since our initial public offering in we will continue to incur significant research and product development  sales and marketing  materials and general administrative expenses  and we expect our expenses to increase as compared to prior periods  as we expand our sales force and our international operations 
we anticipate a net loss for the year and we may continue to incur losses beyond we cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues or margins to sustain our business 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital to fund our operations on reasonable terms and this could hurt our business and negatively impact our stockholders 
if adequate funds in the form of equity or debt are not available on reasonable terms or terms acceptable to us  we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or additional equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced  the securities issued may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock  and the terms of the securities may impose restrictions on our operations 
any additional funding would likely require the approval of our secured convertible note holders  and those note holders may not approve new funding if it requires substantial dilution  waiver of anti dilution adjustment rights  subordination of their security interest  or a lock up of their ability to sell their shares of common stock in the market  even if the funding is in the best interest of the company or our stockholders 
our secured convertible note holders have a senior security interest in all of our assets  and until these investors are paid in full or until they have converted the notes and accrued interest into common stock  we may not be able to obtain additional investment or working capital 
if we are unable to raise additional financing  we may be forced to seek protection under the federal bankruptcy laws 
if we are unable to raise capital from another source we are likely to cease operations or file for protection from claims of our creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws 
if we are unable to pay principal and interest on the million financing when due  we may be forced to seek protection under the federal bankruptcy laws 
the convertible notes we sold in august in connection with our debt financing are convertible into our common stock at the election of the holders 
if not converted  the principal and accrued interest on the notes become payable in august  subject to acceleration in certain circumstances 
if the notes are not converted and we are unable to pay the principal amount and accrued interest on the notes when due  whether at maturity or by acceleration  the investors could foreclose on the notes and force a sale of our assets  including our intellectual property 
under such circumstances  we may need to cease operations or file for protection from claims of our creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws 
at december   million in principal and million in accrued interest under the convertible notes had been converted into common stock 
conversion of the secured convertible notes will significantly dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders 
if shares of our common stock are issued to the investors upon conversion of the secured convertible notes together with accrued interest  existing stockholders will have their ownership percentage substantially diluted 
the number of shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the convertible notes will also affect our earnings per share on a going forward basis 
the larger the number of shares deemed outstanding  the lower the earnings per share will be 
the actual effect of any conversion on our earnings per share will depend on the level of our earnings in future periods  the actual amount converted pursuant to the notes and the impact of the accounting treatment of the secured convertible notes 
at december   million in principal and million in accrued interest had been converted into common stock 
if the remaining million in principal and million in accrued interest as of december  were converted  an additional million shares of common stock would be issued 
we have a limited operating history 
you should not rely on our recent results as an indication of our future results 
our base stations are being used in twenty seven commercially deployed systems 
we had net revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
unless we can achieve significant increases in market acceptance of our products and complete new products in development  we may never advance beyond our initial market penetration phase 
due to our limited operating history  it is difficult or impossible for us to predict future results and you should not expect future revenue growth based on our recent results 
you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and problems faced by technology companies in the early stages of development 
a long lasting downturn in the global economy that impacts the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 
the global economy is in the midst of a slowdown that has had wide ranging effects on markets that we serve  particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
this downturn has had a negative effect on our revenues 
we cannot predict the depth or duration of this downturn  and if it grows more severe or continues for a long period of time  our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 
in addition  because we intend to continue to invest in research and development during this downturn and to maintain ongoing customer service and support capability  any decline in the rate of growth of our revenues will have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
current economic conditions affecting the wireless communications industry may lead prospective and existing customers to postpone their purchasing decisions 
the industry wide decrease in demand for wireless telecommunications infrastructure has adversely affected us 
we cannot predict when the demand will increase or when many of our customers and potential customers will start to make significant purchases of our products 

table of contents our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns 
our revenues  earnings and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
general economic or other conditions causing a downturn in the market for our products or technology  affecting the timing of customer orders or causing cancellations or rescheduling of orders could also adversely affect our operating results 
moreover  our customers may change delivery schedules or cancel or reduce orders without incurring significant penalties and generally are not subject to minimum purchase requirements 
our future operating results will be affected by many factors  including the following changes in the growth rate of the wireless communications industry  consolidation in the wireless communications industry  our ability to compete successfully against similar and larger sized gsm communications equipment providers  continued control of costs and reducing expenses  efficiently manufacturing our products ourselves and through outsourcing arrangements  absorbing overhead costs through higher manufacturing volume  generating cash flow from operations  the mix of our revenue  the collectibility of our trade receivables  our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated customers or orders  both domestically and internationally  the availability and cost of products and services from our third party suppliers  our ability to develop  introduce and market new technology  products and services on a timely basis  our ability to reduce product costs to be cost competitive  foreign currency fluctuations  inflation and deflation  decreases in average selling prices or demand for our products  intellectual property disputes and litigation  government regulations  product defects or delays  the availability of capital to fund operations  management of inventory in response to shifts in market demand  and changes in the mix of technology and products developed  produced and sold 
the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these  as well as other factors  could harm our quarterly or annual operating results 
if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of investors in any period  the market price of our common stock may decline 
if we are unable to achieve or maintain profitability  or if we are unable to achieve cash flow breakeven  we will be unable to build a sustainable business 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may decline as well 
because our products are highly complex and are deployed in complex networks  they may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment  which if not remedied could harm our business 
our products are highly complex  are designed to be deployed in complex networks and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures 
although our products are tested during manufacturing and prior to deployment  they can only be fully tested when deployed in commercial networks 
consequently  our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed 
the occurrence of any defects  errors or failures could result in installation delays  product returns  diversion of our resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by our customers  increased insurance costs and other losses to us or to our customers or end users 
any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which would harm our business and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a sale will be made and could cause us operating difficulties and cash flow problems 
our sales cycle  which is the period from the generation of a sales lead until the recognition of revenue  can be long and is unpredictable  making it difficult to forecast revenues and operating results 
our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of our sales could cause a number of problems we may have difficulty meeting our customers delivery requirements in the event many large orders are received in a short period of time because we have limited production capacity and generally do not carry materials in inventory  we may expend significant management efforts and incur substantial sales and marketing expenses in a particular period that do not translate into orders during that period or at all 
we may have difficulty meeting our cash flow requirements and obtaining credit because of delays in receiving orders and because the terms of many of our customer contracts defer certain billings until post shipment contractual milestones are met 
the problems resulting from our lengthy and variable sales cycle could impede our growth  harm our stock price  and restrict our ability to take advantage of new opportunities 
investment in our stock is speculative  and our stock price is volatile 
in light of the current market conditions for wireless communications  our precarious financial condition and recent sales of our shares by significant stockholders  including scp ii and tecore  inc  we believe that an investment in our stock is highly speculative 
any investment in our common stock should only be made with discretionary capital  all of which an investor can afford to lose 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future as well 
in addition to the volume of sales by our significant stockholders  which is described in more detail below  factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include announcements concerning us  our competitors or the industry  receipt of substantial orders for base stations  quality deficiencies in services or products  announcements regarding financial developments or technological innovations  international developments  such as technology mandates  political developments or changes in economic policies  new commercial products  government regulations  acts of terrorism or war  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation 
our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
shortfalls in our revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts or investors could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we may not continue to meet nasdaq listing standards 
under continued listing standard one rule a  companies listed on the nasdaq national market are required to have net tangible assets of million  total stockholders equity of million  and a minimum bid price of at least per share or a minimum bid price of at least per share with no net tangible asset requirement 
at various times in and  our share price traded at and occasionally below the required minimum bid price of per share for continued listing and or we did not comply with the total stockholders equity requirement 
we cannot give investors in our common stock any assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the per share minimum bid price standard or the total stockholders equity standard for continued listing on nasdaq and that the liquidity that nasdaq provides will be available to investors in the future 
in the absence of additional equity financing  it is possible that our stockholders equity may drop below the million requirement under continued listing standard one rule a during fiscal year there can be no assurance that the nasdaq will permit us to continue our listing on the nasdaq national market or transfer to the nasdaq smallcap market should we fall below the million requirement if we cannot show a definitive plan for maintaining the stockholders equity requirement 
alternatively  continued listing standard two nasdaq rule b requires a market value of million  a market value of listed shares of million and a minimum bid price of with no stockholders equity requirement 
we cannot give investors in our common stock any assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with either minimum standard for continued listing on nasdaq national market or the nasdaq smallcap market and that the liquidity that nasdaq provides will be available to investors in the future 

table of contents intense competition in the market for wireless telecommunications equipment from many larger  more established companies with greater resources could prevent us from increasing our revenue and achieving profitability 
the wireless telecommunications infrastructure market is highly competitive 
we compete with large infrastructure manufacturers  systems integrators  and base station subsystem suppliers  as well as new market entrants 
most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  larger installed customer bases  substantially greater name recognition  and more financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales  distribution and other resources than we do 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including companies that develop and market new wireless telecommunications products and services 
these competitive pressures may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of customers 
in addition roaming considerations and bundled mobile switch centers mscs price performance competition has impeded our sales in the north american market 
competition in the telecommunications market is based on varying combinations  including comprehensiveness of product and technology solutions  manufacturing capability  scalability and the ability of the system solution to meet customers immediate and future network requirements  product performance and quality  design and engineering capabilities  compliance with industry standards  time to market  system cost  and customer support 
we anticipate that additional competitors will enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in wireless telecommunications  the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors  technological and public policy changes and relatively low barriers to entry in selected segments of the industry 
as a result of these factors  these competitors may be more successful than we are 
in addition  we anticipate additional competitors will enter the market for products based on g  g eg  wimax or other advanced high speed data standards 
these competitors may have more established relationships and distribution channels in markets not currently deploying wireless communications technology 
these competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
these relationships may affect customers decisions to purchase products from us 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share to our detriment 
our comparative inability to provide financing for our customers is a competitive disadvantage and could result in a loss of sales and or customers to competitors with greater resources 
we do not typically offer financing to our customers  which could cause us to lose business to our larger competitors 
our future success may depend upon our continuing ability to help arrange financing for our customers 
if we cannot assist in arranging financing for our customers  we may lose sales and customers to competitors that directly provide financing 
credit risk problems resulting from customer financing could hurt our results and require us to raise additional capital 
many of our customers and potential customers are start up and small companies with a limited operating history 
in limited instances  we have provided and may continue to provide customer financing 
we face credit risks  including slow payments or non payments from customers  and we may need to raise additional capital to support financed sales and to deal with related credit risk problems 
a small number of customers account for substantially all of our revenues and the loss of any of these customers could hurt our results and cause our stock price to decline 
our customer base has been and may continue to be concentrated with a small number of customers 
the loss of any of these customers or the delay  reduction or cancellation of orders by or shipments to any of these customers could hurt our results and cause a decline in our stock price 
the effect of these risks on our operating results is compounded by our lengthy sales cycle 
in  sales to three customers accounted for of our total revenue 
in  sales to three customers accounted for of our total revenue and in sales to four customers accounted for 

table of contents the chart below shows the breakout by fiscal year of the concentration of revenue years ended december  tecore wireless systems us government alcatel hafatel guam wireless undisclosed leading defense contractor a undisclosed leading defense contractor b undisclosed leading defense contractor c undisclosed leading defense contractor d mbo cross comtel telsom mobile pioneer pinpoint adams our reliance on sales to a small number of customers makes customer satisfaction crucial for revenue growth 
even where our product meets original product specifications set forth in our contracts  we may need or be asked to make modifications to our product design or performance in order to meet the customer s expectations or in order to maintain the customer relationship 
this is a greater risk when we sell products through an oem relationship to large operator customers 
if we are unable to meet the ultimate customer s original or revised expectations  we may lose the customer and we could be faced with disputes over return of our products 
we have a concentrated customer base and the failure of any of our customers to pay us or to pay us on time could cause significant cash flow problems  hurt our results and cause our stock price to decline 
our concentrated customer base significantly increases the credit risks associated with slow payments or non payments by our customers 
these risks are also higher for us since many of our customers are start up and small companies 
two customers accounted for of our outstanding net accounts receivable as of december   with tecore representing and alcatel representing 
two customers accounted for of our outstanding net accounts and notes receivable as of december   with one customer  tecore  representing 
two customers accounted for of our combined outstanding net accounts and notes receivable as of december  in the past we have incurred bad debt charges and we may be required to do so in the future 
the failure of any of our customers to pay us  or to pay us on time  causes significant cash flow problems  hurts our results and could cause our stock price to decline 
intense price performance competition for base stations and mobile switch centers will reduce sales opportunities in north american markets 
as a result of the reduction in global demand  our competitors have been bundling mobile switch centers mscs together with base stations at deeply discounted pricing levels targeting our traditional customer base resulting in intense price performance competition 
this competition has substantially reduced opportunities for us to expand or to continue sales of our coverage solution products to small medium sized pcs operators in north america 
we are executing a significant cost reduction program for our products and we have programs in place to enhance the msc price performance to address these competitive pressures but there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful 
if we are unable to overcome the current competitive pressures facing us in connection with our traditional target market of small to medium operators for cost effective coverage solutions  we may be unable to compete against our larger competitors for future sales to small and medium sized pcs operators in north america 
if we continue to expand into international markets  we will become subject to additional business risks 
we market and sell our products internationally in africa  the middle east  asia and latin america both through oem resellers and our direct sales staff 
our business plan contemplates that a significant portion of our planned sales over the next several years will be in international markets 
our revenues from direct sales to international customers as a percentage of total revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal our revenues from oem international sales were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in many international markets  barriers to entry are created by long standing relationships between our potential customers and their local providers and protective regulations  including local content and service requirements 
in addition  our pursuit of international growth opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before we realize returns  if any  on our investments 
our international operations could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing risks and uncertainties  including difficulties and costs associated with obtaining foreign regulatory approval for our products  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  
table of contents legal uncertainties regarding  and timing delays and expenses associated with  tariffs  export licenses and other trade barriers  inadequate protection of intellectual property in foreign countries  increased difficulty in collecting delinquent or unpaid accounts  lack of suitable export financing  adverse tax consequences  dependence upon independent sales representatives and other indirect resellers who may not be as effective and reliable as our employees  difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing international operations  overcoming cultural  linguistic and nationalistic barriers and adapting to foreign business practices  political and economic instability  and currency fluctuations  including a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which could make our products less competitive against those of foreign competitors 
in addition to general risks associated with our international sales and operations  we are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we do business 
a portion of our international sales efforts will be targeted to service operators who plan to deploy wireless communications networks in developing countries where risks ordinarily associated with international operations are particularly acute  including developing countries in africa  asia  the middle east and latin america 
any of these factors could impair our ability to expand into international markets and could prevent us from increasing our revenues and achieving profitability 
we sell products in emerging markets in the middle east  asia and africa 
future sales in these markets will be subject to economic and political risks 
for the year ended december   our sales in these markets accounted for approximately of our revenue 
sales in these markets pose significant additional risks  which include potential inability to enforce contracts or take other legal action  including actions to protect intellectual property rights  difficulty in collecting revenues  obtaining letters of credit  and risks related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  particularly if sales are denominated in the local currency rather than in us dollars  changes in united states foreign trade policy towards countries in the middle east and africa which may restrict our ability to export products to  or make sales in  those markets and similar changes in those markets policy regarding the united states  and changes in government regulation affecting companies doing business in the middle east and africa  either through export sales or local manufacturing operations 
in the event our revenue levels from sales to the middle east and africa increase  we will become increasingly subject to these risks 
the occurrence of any of these risks would harm our revenues or cash collections from our customers and could in turn cause our revenue  cash flow or growth to decline and harm our business and results of operations 
sales in certain foreign countries pose unique and significant risks 
a substantial portion of our product sales in were directly or indirectly made to operators in foreign countries  including countries experiencing armed conflict  civil unrest and instability  reports of terrorist activities  and anti american sentiment and activities 
conditions in these countries present unique and significant risks 
actions by foreign governments or hostile forces could result in harm to our personnel or our customers personnel  or the loss of customers and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business 
our business and operating results may be harmed by inflation and deflation 
inflation has had and may continue to have adverse effects on the economies and securities markets of certain countries and could have adverse effects on our customers  including their ability to obtain financing and repay debts 
brazil and mexico  for example  have periodically experienced relatively high rates of inflation and currency devaluation 
significant inflation or deflation could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial position 
if we do not succeed in the development of new products and product features in response to changing technology and standards  customers will not buy our products 
we need to develop new products and product features in response to the evolving demands for better technology or our customers will not buy our products 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  emerging wireless transmission standards  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
if we fail to develop our technology  we will lose significant potential market share to our competitors 

table of contents our failure to comply with evolving industry standards could delay our introduction of new products 
an international consortium of standards bodies has established the specifications for the third generation g wireless standard  and is further working to establish the specifications of a future wireless standard and its interoperability with existing standards 
any failure of our products to comply with g or future standards could delay their introduction and require costly and time consuming engineering changes 
after the future standard is adopted  any delays in our introduction of next generation products could impair our ability to grow revenues in the future 
as a result  we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
even if we do develop our technology and products to work with these new standards  consumer demand for advanced wireless services may not be sufficient to justify network operators upgrading to them 
our market opportunity could be significantly diminished in the event that gsm or any subsequent gsm based standards do not continue to be widely adopted 
our current products are designed to utilize only gsm  an international standard for voice and data communications 
there are other competing standards including code division multiple access  or cdma 
in the event that gsm or any gsm based standards do not continue to be or are not broadly adopted  our market opportunity could be significantly limited  which would seriously harm our business 
if we fail to accurately estimate product demand  we may incur expenses for excess inventory or be unable to meet customer requirements 
our customers typically give us firm purchase orders with short lead times before requested shipment 
however  our contract manufacturer requires commitments from us so that it can allocate capacity and be assured of having adequate components and supplies from third parties 
failure to accurately estimate product demand could cause us to incur expenses related to excess inventory or prevent us from meeting customer requirements 
in addition  our products are constantly evolving requiring new assemblies and components 
if we fail to accurately estimate product demand  some inventory could be designed out resulting in excess inventory 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers could lead to delays  additional costs  problems with our customers and loss of revenue 
a reduction or interruption in component supply or a significant increase in component prices could have a material adverse effect on our business or profitability 
our ability to meet customer demands depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of parts and components from our suppliers and internal manufacturing capacity 
we plan to continue utilizing only one or a small number of suppliers for each of the components of our base station systems 
we have no long term contracts or arrangements with any of our suppliers that guarantee product availability or the continuation of particular payment or credit terms 
if  for any reason  a supplier fails to meet our quality and quantity requirements or stops selling products to us at commercially reasonable prices  we could experience significant production delays and cost increases  as well as higher warranty expenses and product image problems 
we have experienced component shortages in the past  including components for our integrated circuit products  that have adversely affected our operations 
although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of shortages  we may continue to encounter these problems in the future 
any of these problems could damage relationships with current or prospective customers  which could seriously harm our operating results in a given period and impair our ability to generate future sales from time to time  we must replace some of the components of our products when the supplier of that component discontinues production 
while we generally do not maintain an inventory of components  sometimes we do purchase an inventory of these discontinued components so that we can maintain production while finding new suppliers or developing substitute components ourselves 
we face the risk that we may deplete that inventory before finding an adequate substitute  and that could cause the loss of significant sales opportunities 
alternatively  we could purchase too many of the components and may be left with excess inventory on our hands 
we generally do not maintain an inventory of finished goods and many components have long lead times  with some taking to weeks from the time of entry of the order to delivery 
we cannot guarantee that alternative sources of supply can be arranged on short notice or that components will be available from alternative sources on satisfactory terms 
we may not be able to adequately protect or defend our proprietary rights  which would hurt our ability to compete 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  and nondisclosure agreements and other measures  intellectual property is difficult to evaluate and these measures may not provide adequate protection for our proprietary rights and information 
patent filings by third parties  whether made before or after the date of our filings  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
competitors may misappropriate our proprietary rights and information  disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise  and our proprietary rights and information may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the failure to protect our proprietary rights could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have a relatively low number of inventions for which patents have been granted or patent applications are pending internationally 
if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property  our competitiveness in international markets could be significantly impaired  which would limit our growth and future revenues 
others may bring infringement claims against us that could be time consuming and expensive to defend 
in the future  claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights  invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims may be asserted or prosecuted against us 
even if none of these claims were valid or successful  we would be forced to incur significant costs and divert important resources to defend against them 
any claim of infringement  whether or not successful  could cause us considerable expense and place a significant burden on our management 

table of contents a significant decrease in the cost of digital t e phone lines or microwave will diminish one of our competitive advantages 
existing base stations require an expensive physical communications link  usually through a digital t e phone line or microwave  to the wireline network 
any significant decrease in the cost of digital t e phone lines or microwave used to connect base stations to the wireline network  especially in less populated areas  will diminish a cost advantage that we currently use to market our products 
the cost of t e or microwave facilities has recently declined significantly in urban areas because of increased competition 
if we fail to expand our customer base beyond the smaller operators  we may not be able to significantly grow our revenues 
we will only be able to significantly grow our revenues if we can expand our customer base beyond the smaller operators 
there are a limited number of such operators and most of them have limited resources 
these operators are less stable and more susceptible to delays in their build outs and deployments than more established operators 
we plan on expanding our sales to include the larger domestic operators and international operators 
however  as a result of the rapid consolidation of larger domestic gsm operators  there are only a few larger domestic operators remaining 
to date we have not had any sales to the larger domestic operators  and we may not be successful in those markets in the future 
we have started to sell our products and services to the us government or us government contractors  and the loss of these relationships or a shift in government funding could have adverse consequences on our business 
approximately of our net sales in fiscal were to the us government or to us government contractors 
therefore  any significant disruption or deterioration of these relationships with the us government and its contractors could significantly reduce our revenues 
our us government programs must compete with programs managed by other defense contractors for a limited number of programs and for uncertain levels of funding 
our competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the us government and likely will continue these efforts in the future 
the us government may choose to use other defense contractors for its limited number of defense programs 
in addition  the funding of defense programs also competes with non defense spending of the us government 
budget decisions made by the us government are outside of our control and have long term consequences for our business 
a shift in government defense spending to other programs in which we are not involved  or a reduction in us government defense spending generally  could have adverse consequences on our business 
our products are designed to operate at frequencies defined by the gsm standard 
in our pursuit of selling our products to the u 
s government and us government contractors for use domestically  government customers may wish to use airnet products at frequencies that may not be consistent with regard to frequency spectrum policies of the fcc and ntia for use by those government agencies 
the inability of airnet or government customers to adequately address frequency spectrum policies with regard to use of airnet products by government customers within the united states  can have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products in that market segment 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to operate our business successfully 
our future success largely depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled hardware and software engineers  particularly call processing engineers and digital signal processing engineers 
if we cannot continue to attract and retain quality personnel  that failure would significantly limit our ability to compete and to grow our business 
our success also depends upon the continuing contributions of our key management  research  product development  sales and marketing and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
except for an employment and severance agreement we have with glenn ehley  our ceo and president  and joseph f 
gerrity  our cfo and vice president  and a noncompetition agreement that we have with terry williams  our cto  we do not have employment or noncompetition agreements with any of our key officers 
we also do not have key man life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
see employees under item i business for a discussion of potential impediments to retention of key personnel 
if we fail to manage our operations efficiently  our business and prospects could be seriously harmed 
the need to develop and offer our products and implement our business plan in a difficult market will significantly challenge our planning and management capabilities 
we may not be able to implement management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner 
if we are unable to manage our operations efficiently  our business and prospects could be seriously harmed 
to manage our operations and personnel  we will need to improve financial and operational controls  as well as our reporting systems and procedures  install new management information systems  and train  motivate and manage our sales and marketing  engineering  technical  finance and customer support employees 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires companies such as airnet that are not accelerated filers to comply with more stringent internal control system and monitoring requirements beginning in compliance with this new requirement may place an expensive burden and significant time constraint on companies with limited resources 
we have an agreement with motorola  inc to grant them rights  which could harm our business 
when motorola purchased million of our series b preferred stock in  we granted motorola the right to acquire a worldwide  non exclusive  royalty free license under any two of our patents 
motorola is a large telecommunications and technology company with significant resources and could 
table of contents exercise this right at any time and begin using these licenses to compete against us 
with respect to any possible infringement of our respective digital base station patents  motorola has agreed with us not to enjoin the other and to attempt dispute resolution  including negotiation of non exclusive license agreements in good faith  before resorting to litigation 
we expect the prices of our products to decline due to competitive pressures  and this decline could reduce our revenues and gross margins 
we anticipate that the prices of our products will decrease in the future due to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions or other factors 
if we are unable to offset these factors by increasing our sales volumes  our revenues will decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  and we must continue to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do these things successfully 
our failure to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could seriously harm our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our industry is subject to extensive government regulation that could cause significant delays and expense 
wireless telecommunications are subject to extensive regulation by the us and foreign governments 
if we fail to conform our products to regulatory requirements or experience any delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  we could lose sales 
moreover  in most cases  we only plan to qualify our products in a foreign country once we have a purchase order from a customer located there  and this practice may deter customers or contribute to delays in receiving or filling orders 
continuing regulatory compliance could be expensive and may require time consuming and costly modifications of our products 
any failure of domestic and international regulatory authorities to allocate suitable frequency spectrum could limit our growth opportunities and our future revenues 
directors and officers insurance may be difficult or cost prohibitive to obtain 
our current directors and officers insurance policy was difficult and expensive to obtain 
the policy will expire on december  it may be difficult and or expensive to secure a replacement policy 
if we are unable to renew or secure a replacement policy  we could lose our officers and directors and it will be extremely difficult to recruit qualified replacements for our management team and board of directors  which would have a material adverse affect on our business 
control by our existing stockholders could discourage the potential acquisition of our business 
as of february   or greater stockholders and their affiliates owned approximately million shares of our common stock or approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
in addition  two of these stockholders  tecore and scp private equity partners ii  lp scp ii  hold the rights to acquire another approximately million shares of common stock upon conversion or exercise of other securities 
acting together  these stockholders would be able to control all matters requiring approval by stockholders  including the election of directors 
moreover  since the sale of the secured convertible notes to tecore and scp ii  the combined interests of these two investors constitute a potential controlling interest in the company  with tecore holding a majority of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis assuming full conversion of tecore s note 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our business or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
some of our larger investors have sold and may attempt to further sell their common stock  which may depress the market price of our securities 
scp private equity partners ii  lp and tecore each beneficially hold more than of the company s common stock 
scp private equity partners ii  lp  which at february  held approximately million shares of common stock  sold approximately million shares in and may continue selling in tecore  which at february  held approximately million shares  sold approximately million shares in and may continue selling in other large investors may elect to sell at the same or proximate times 
if any one of these investors sells their common shares  the number of buyers in the market may not support the shares being sold and the market price of our shares could drop 
the effect of these sales could be further accelerated in the event the company is not able to maintain its nasdaq national market listing 
we may face liquidated damage payments under our agreement with investors in our equity investment if we suspend use of their resale registration statement further 
in light of the restatement described in note in notes to financial statements  we advised the investors from our april common stock financing  as of march   not to use the resale registration statement under which we had registered the resale of their common stock until we filed our restated financial statements 
under the terms of the registration rights agreement we signed with these investors at the time of their investment  if the registration statement is unavailable to them for trading days cumulatively  we may be liable for liquidated damages to those investors who continue to hold our common stock in amounts of up to and thereafter per month on a pro rata basis 
if we are required to suspend the use of the registration statement further in the future  we may exceed the permitted trading day limit 
our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent a misstatement in our financial statements 
the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec rules that have been promulgated in connection with it require  among other things  the management of public companies to prepare a report that addresses the adequacy of a company s internal control over financial reporting 
the company s independent auditor also needs to attest to the report 

table of contents under the applicable rules  as a non accelerated filer  we will not be required to prepare and include this report in our filings until our annual report for our fiscal year ending december  however  we note that we recently restated our financial results for the fiscal year ended december   for the last two quarters of fiscal  and for the first three quarters of fiscal see note in notes to financial statements and item under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board  such a restatement of previously issued financial statements is a strong indicator of the existence of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 
under the relevant sec rules  management will not be permitted to conclude that internal control over financial reporting is effective if it has identified one or more material weaknesses in those internal controls 
the events surrounding the restatement may be an indication that we have insufficient personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within our internal accounting function to resolve non routine or complex accounting issues 
as a small company with limited resources  we may find the cost of addressing these matters by hiring additional accounting staff with such technical expertise to be prohibitive 
we have been using an outside consultant to review our internal controls  it systems  control strengths and weaknesses  documentation and review procedures 
however  if we are unable to address these issues before we are required to report our conclusions relating to our internal control over financial reporting  our management and independent auditors may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
moreover  while we note that a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting does not itself suggest a material misstatement of a company s financial statements  if we are unable to address these matters as they relate to the application of generally accepted accounting principles to complex  non routine transactions  there is a risk going forward that a material misstatement in our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
investment in our stock is speculative 
in light of the current market conditions for wireless communications  we believe that an investment in our stock is highly speculative and volatile  and subject to numerous risks which are described in this document 
any investment in our common stock should only be made with discretionary capital  all of which an investor can afford to lose 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest the proceeds from our financing activities in interest bearing  investment grade securities that mature within months 
our transactions are generally conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  these funds were not exposed to significant foreign currency risk at december  due to the fixed rate nature of senior debt  our interest rate risk is minimal
