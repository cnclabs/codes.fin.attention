the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes 
overview through december   we managed our business through two reportable segments internet banking and lending 
on november  we completed our acquisition of magnet communications  inc  a privately held company based in atlanta  georgia  for million in cash and million shares of our common stock with a fair value of million 
with the acquisition of magnet  we combined our corporate banking business  which was formerly managed within our internet banking segment  with the operations of magnet and now manage our business through three reportable segments internet banking  corporate banking and lending 
the following segment data has been revised to reflect our three reportable segments 
summarized results of operations for our reportable segments were as follows for the three years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands dollars dollars dollars revenues internet banking corporate banking lending total dollars margin dollars margin dollars margin gross profit internet banking corporate banking lending unallocated total dollars dollars dollars operating expenses internet banking corporate banking lending unallocated total 
table of contents dollars margin dollars margin dollars margin net income loss from operations internet banking corporate banking lending unallocated total for the years ended december   and  no customer comprised more than of total revenues or internet banking segment revenues 
in the corporate banking segment  no customer accounted for more than of segment revenues during the year ended december  for the years ended december   and  two customers and one customer  respectively  accounted for approximately of corporate banking revenues 
for the years ended december    and  one customer accounted for greater than of total lending revenues representing   and  respectively 
we have no significant foreign operations 
results for and have been reclassified to conform to the presentation as follows a prior year internet banking results have been revised to conform to the presentation of corporate banking as a separate reportable segment and b general and administrative expenses have been reclassified to unallocated expenses 
the operating results of magnet included in the corporate banking segment for the year ended december  from the acquisition date of november  were as follows revenue   gross profit   operating expenses  and loss from operations  unallocated expenses include charges that are not included in the measurement of segment profit or loss used internally to manage the segments 
unallocated operating expenses include  of intangible asset amortization and  of general and administrative expenses 
unallocated operating expenses include  of intangible asset amortization and  of general and administrative expenses 
unallocated gross profit includes of deferred stock based compensation included in cost of revenues 
unallocated operating expenses include of deferred stock based compensation   of intangible asset amortization   of restructuring  asset impairment and other charges  and  of general and administrative expenses 
a large portion of our internet banking revenue results from the number of active internet banking end users at our financial institution clients 
summarized end users  in thousands  at december of each of the last three years were as follows end users penetration end users penetration end users penetration potential end users at all sites  n a  n a  n a potential end users at live sites  n a  n a  n a active internet banking end users bill payment end users penetration for active end users is calculated as a percentage of potential end users at live sites 
penetration for bill payment end users is calculated as a percentage of active internet banking end users 
active internet banking end users are consumers whose basic account information is available online as specified by our contract with the financial institution 
includes potential end users at live sites as well as potential end users at financial institutions that are in the implementation process 

table of contents known trends and uncertainties the following discussion identifies known trends and uncertainties currently impacting each of our business segments 
the growth in our internet banking revenues during the year ended december  was driven primarily by a increase in internet banking end users and a increase in online bill payment users when compared to december  revenue from end user growth was partially offset by a slight decrease in the average revenue per end user  due primarily to price discounts experienced at the time of contract renewal generally once every three to five years and the effects of tiered pricing incentives in most of our contracts 
we expect a continuing modest decline in average monthly revenue per internet banking end user over the next several years as our base of end users continues to increase and as customers renew their contracts with us 
our corporate banking revenues for the year ended december  reflect the acquisition of magnet in november that has been combined with our existing corporate banking business 
revenues from the acquired corporate banking business during the year ended december  were negatively impacted by unexpected delays in certain professional services projects that have limited our ability to begin new professional services projects from which to generate additional revenues 
we also continue to invest significant resources to further develop our corporate banking software for large financial institutions  which increased costs and reduced our resources dedicated to supporting new sales 
we believe that these trends will continue for the magnet business in and possibly into recurring revenue contributions from our outsourced corporate banking products  including the magnet products hosted in our data center  remained strong and we expect that this performance will continue 
we expect to continue to invest substantial amounts in continuing to improve our corporate banking products for large financial institutions 
the decrease in our lending revenues during the year ended december  reflects certain key customer losses  a decrease in the number of lending applications processed  and the continuation of a shift in the number of applications processed from the call center to the internet 
internet applications result in lower revenue per application compared to applications received through our call center 
we expect the internet channel to continue to increase as a percentage of total loan applications processed in future quarters 
we recently introduced desktop lender premium  a new product in the lending division 
while the product was rolled out in late  we do not anticipate any significant revenue benefits from this new product until after the latter part of summary of financial statement captions the following section sets forth a general description of the items that comprise our primary financial statement captions 
revenues we derive revenues primarily from long term service contracts with our financial institution clients  which pay recurring service fees  based primarily on the number of active end users or end user transactions  or fixed monthly amounts  primarily for hosting and maintaining web sites 
we also earn recurring service fee revenue from the annual software maintenance fee billings for the license customers using our corporate banking product 
in addition  our revenues include fees earned for implementation services  software license fees  professional services  and other revenues 
revenues from recurring service fees are recognized as services are provided 
see critical accounting policies and estimates for a description of our revenue recognition policy 
recurring service fees were over of total revenues in and  and approximately in cost of revenues and gross profit revenues are reduced by costs of revenues that are comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  network costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment and software used in providing our service  expenses related to the operation of our data centers and call center  and fees paid to third parties  including bill payment vendors  online statement and check imaging vendors and 
table of contents communication services providers 
cost of revenues also includes the recognition of deferred implementation costs which are recognized ratably over the estimated term of our customer relationships 
operating expenses we include sales  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and restructuring  asset impairment and other charges in operating expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  sales  marketing  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  sales commissions  and other general corporate expenses 
in addition  these expenses include marketing expenses such as trade shows  promotional costs and end user marketing campaigns and payments to core data processing vendors under marketing alliance agreements 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  related personnel expenses and consultant fees related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products and our data processing vendor interface software 
amortization of intangibles consists of the amortization of identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions of ata  vifi and magnet 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in as a result of actions taken to optimize our cost structure 
as a result of these restructuring activities we reduced space utilized at three facilities  eliminated employee positions and relocated or reassigned employees 
in  we also recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to computer software and equipment abandoned or removed from service and other charges of million including million net of insurance recoveries of million from the settlement of the fundsxpress litigation 
income tax provision benefit in the fourth quarter of  we determined that our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was no longer required 
this determination was based on an evaluation of positive and negative factors including our history of achieving operating objectives  the achievement of  and improvement in  sustained operating profitability beginning in the third quarter of  the long term nature of our contracts and our established customer relationships  future projections of pre tax income  and the lack of significant limitations on the use of acquired net operating losses 
we recognized an income tax benefit of million in including million related to reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance at december  partially offset by a net provision for current and deferred federal and state income taxes of million 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes of million 
this provision represents million for current year income tax activity along with a provision of million to adjust certain prior year tax amounts as described in the section that follows

gross profit margin for the lending division decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period last year 
the decrease in gross margin for the lending division is due to the decrease in revenues and the flat cost of revenues discussed above 
operating expenses operating expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the prior year

the increase is due to amortization of acquired intangibles from the magnet acquisition in november interest and other income  net interest and other income  net was  for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to  for the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income as result of higher rates of return on our cash and investment balances and larger amounts invested 
benefit provision for income taxes during the twelve months ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes of million compared to an income tax benefit for of million 
the current year provision reflects a tax rate of and a tax adjustment related to certain amounts recorded in of million to reduce the carrying value of certain of our deferred tax assets  to establish tax contingency reserves and to reduce the tax benefit recorded to equity 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit for of million comprised of million related to the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance partially offset by a net provision for current and deferred federal and state income taxes of million

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
the following sections set forth the revenue recognition policy for our primary sources of revenue as well as the accounting policies followed for certain other revenue arrangements 
application service provider revenues 
we earn revenues from application service provider asp arrangements for which we host our customers internet banking  corporate banking and lending applications 
revenues are earned for upfront fees for implementation services and amounts billed for recurring monthly services 
we recognize revenue from asp arrangements in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under sab  we recognize revenues when fees are fixed and determinable  no obligations remain related to the earned fees and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
under eitf  we allocate revenues in arrangements with multiple deliverables to each qualifying separate unit of accounting based on either their relative fair values or the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair value is determined by the prices charged when the element is sold separately or other specific objective evidence 
we defer recognition of certain implementation fee revenue  which includes set up fees for each service element and mandatory training  that are not the culmination of a separate earnings process and 
table of contents recognize them ratably over the greater of the initial life of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer service relationship  generally between four and five years 
we also defer the recognition of the related direct incremental implementation costs and recognize them ratably over the same period 
recurring service fees are billed on a monthly basis and are based on the number of end users  end user transactions  or a flat monthly fee 
revenue from recurring service fees are recognized as services are provided 
arrangements with data processing vendors 
we have joint sales and marketing agreements with several data processing software vendors of our financial institution clients 
generally  we pay a recurring referral fee to these data processing software vendors based on fees billed by us to our financial institution customers for the services provided by us 
under these arrangements  we are the primary obligor  perform all services  establish prices charged to the financial institution for our services  and bear all performance and collection risks 
because of these factors  we recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the gross amount earned from the customer in accordance with eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the referral fees earned by the data processing software vendors are recognized as incurred in sales  general and administrative expenses 
we bill two data processing software vendors directly for the services provided by us to financial institution customers 
under these arrangements  the data processing vendor sets the actual price charged to the financial institution  bundles our services with other vendor services  performs administrative functions including billing  and bears all collection risk 
because of these factors  we recognize the revenue under these arrangements based on the net revenue earned from the data processing vendor in accordance with eitf no 
third party service provider arrangements 
we have agreements with third party vendors to resell the services of those third party vendors to our financial institution customers 
these services include bill payment  online statement  and check imaging services 
we are obligated to provide these services to our customers and there is no contractual arrangement between the third party vendors and our customers 
in addition  we price these services independent of the amounts billed by the third party vendors to us and we bear all collection risk for the amounts billed to our customers 
in accordance with eitf no 
 amounts earned from our customers from the resale of these services are recorded as revenue on a gross basis and the costs incurred from the third party service providers are recorded as cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
software license revenues 
revenue from the sale of software licenses is recognized in accordance with statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
for arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of software  we apply the provisions of accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue is derived from the sale of software licenses  professional services  and customer support maintenance 
revenue is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair value of undelivered elements based on prices charged when the elements are sold separately 
revenue is recognized upon delivery if there is evidence of an arrangement  collection of the fee is reasonably assured and the fee is fixed or determinable 
fees for software licenses and professional services are typically billed under fixed price arrangements 
revenues derived from license and professional service fees that require significant production  modification  or customization of the software is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion is measured by the percentage of labor effort incurred to date to estimated total labor effort to complete the delivery of each license 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 

table of contents revenues to provide professional services on a time and materials basis to software license customers are recognized as the related services are performed 
maintenance revenue is earned for providing technical support and software updates on a when and if available basis 
we recognize all maintenance revenue ratably over the applicable maintenance period 
we determine the amount of maintenance revenue to be deferred through reference to maintenance renewal provisions contained in the agreement or  in the absence of such renewal provisions  through reference to vendor specific objective evidence of maintenance renewal rates 
other revenues 
other revenues are derived from web site design  optional training services  and other optional products or services purchased separately by customers  which represents the culmination of a separate earnings process 
we also earn revenue for early termination fees when customers terminate their services prior to the expiration date of their service contract 
these other revenues are recognized when the fees are fixed and determinable  no obligations remain related to the earned fees and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for billing adjustments for the resolution of potential billing disputes and an allowance for estimated losses associated with the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when necessary 
the estimate of the amount of receivables we will not be able to collect requires judgment and is based on factors including our historical loss and billing adjustment experience  current market conditions  the nature of any current billing disputes and the financial health of specific customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or our current loss profile was to change  additional allowances may be required 
receivables are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a receivable balance  or portion thereof  has been confirmed 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured at the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when those differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
prior to  we had determined it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets were not realizable 
accordingly  we fully reserved our deferred tax assets to reflect our history of operating losses and the inherent uncertainties surrounding future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of  based on our history of achieving operating objectives  the achievement of operating profitability beginning in the third quarter of  our projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  the long term nature of our contracts and our established customer relationships  and the lack of significant limitations on the use of acquired net operating losses  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
at december   we have deferred tax assets of million 
should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
we maintain an income tax contingency reserve for differences between the as filed and book basis of certain tax assets 
the income tax contingency reserve was million and million at december  and  respectively 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 both adopted on january   which generally require us to assess these assets for recoverability at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
we use the fair value method to assess the recoverability of our goodwill and have three reporting units  internet banking  corporate banking  and lending 
we use the undiscounted cash flows method to assess the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we recorded a 
table of contents goodwill impairment charge of million upon adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of future impairment assessments could result in additional impairment charges that would further reduce the carrying values of these assets 
contingencies and litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities  including threatened or pending litigation and potential disputes related to tax positions  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and  in some instances  based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and million of long term investments 
our investments are comprised of readily marketable commercial paper  corporate debt  us government agency securities  and auction rate debt and preferred securities 
for financial statement presentation  we classify our investments as short term and long term based upon their maturity dates 
short term investments primarily mature within one year of the date of the financial statements and long term investments mature between one and two years from december  we classify auction rate securities with maturity dates of more than one year as short term investments as the established interest rate reset periods are less than one year 
the market value of our investments is sensitive to changes in the level of us interest rates and the market ratings of the underlying companies 
therefore  if investments we hold are sold prior to their maturity date  a gain or loss may result 
we invest our cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality  investment grade corporate issuers 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss carry forwards will begin to expire in for federal and state tax purposes 
under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  certain substantial changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
at december   we are limited as to the amount of the net operating loss carry forward related to the magnet acquisition we are able to utilize per year 
we anticipate that we will be able to utilize the full amount of the magnet net operating loss carry forwards prior to the expiration of the utilization period 
we also had research and other credit carry forwards for federal and state tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
the research and other credit carry forwards will begin to expire in for federal income tax purposes  however  these credits do not expire for state income tax purposes 
although we will provide for income taxes at an effective tax rate of in  we do not expect to make significant cash tax payments until as we utilize these carry forwards to offset our current income tax liabilities 
in january  we renewed and amended our agreement with a bank for a million revolving credit commitment through october the interest rate on this facility is equal to either the bank s prime rate  or libor plus 
we may draw down against this facility by electing either the bank s prime rate or libor for specified month  month  month  or month libor terms 
as of december   million was outstanding under our bank facility that was repaid on january  there were no amounts outstanding under our bank facility as of december  or december  the revolver includes covenants that require us to i maintain a tangible net worth of not less than million at all times  ii maintain positive quarterly operating income of not less than  and iii maintain a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of greater than to we were in compliance with the covenants at december  cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash from

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
the improvement in as compared to of million was primarily the result of our operating income of million during the year ended december  as compared to our loss from operations of million including restructuring  asset impairment  and other charges of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in due to improved operating results was partially offset by the million litigation settlement payment discussed above 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to a decrease in acquisition payments of million offset by an increase in net purchases of investments of million 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million

cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash from financing activities in was due to a million increase in cash from the issuance of common stock and a decrease in debt repayments of million 
these increases in cash from financing activities in were partially offset by cash used to repurchase treasury stock of million 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in compared to was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million partially offset by an increase in debt repayments of million 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we had no material commitments other than our operating leases and minimum vendor commitments 
our commitments under these obligations are as follows payment schedule total thereafter in thousands operating leases minimum vendor commitments total obligations future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing of research and product development efforts  any expansion of our marketing efforts  purchases of our common stock and any acquisitions 
we expect to continue to expend significant amounts on ongoing research and development  computer and related data center equipment  and personnel 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  investments and our funds from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
an increase or decrease in market interest rates by as of december  would not cause a significant change in the fair value of our investments 
although the fair value of investments may change due to interest rate fluctuations  we have historically held our investments to maturity  which reduces the overall risk of changes in the fair value of our investments 
we are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes as they affect our revolving credit commitment 
the interest rate charged on our bank facility varies with the bank s prime rate or libor and  consequently  our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the facility 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under our bank facility 
we are not exposed to foreign currency risk since all revenues and expenses are in us dollars 
there were no significant changes to our market risk in
