item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  below 
types of contracts while the basic terms and conditions of the contracts that we perform may vary considerably  generally we perform our work under two groups of contracts cost reimbursable  and guaranteed maximum and fixed price contracts 
as of december   the following table breaks down the percentage and amount of revenue associated with these types of contracts for our existing backlog backlog in millions cost reimbursable guaranteed maximum and fixed price under cost reimbursable contracts  the client reimburses our costs in developing a project and pays us a pre determined fee or a fee based upon a percentage of the costs incurred in completing the project 
our profit may be in the form of a fee  a simple mark up applied to labor costs incurred in the contract  or a combination of the two 
the fee element may also vary 
the fee may be an incentive fee based upon achieving certain performance factors  milestones or targets  it may be a fixed amount in the contract  or it may be based upon a percentage of the costs incurred 
our government segment  as a prime contractor or a major subcontractor for a number of united states government programs  generally performs its services under cost reimbursable contracts although subject to applicable statutes and regulations 
in many cases  these contracts include incentive fee arrangements 
the programs in question often take many years to complete and may be implemented by the award of many different contracts 
despite the fact that these programs are generally awarded on a multi year basis  the funding for the programs is generally approved on an annual basis by congress 
the government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level  or funds for a program may even be eliminated thereby significantly curtailing or stopping a program 
some of our government contracts are known as indefinite delivery indefinite quantity agreements 
under these arrangements  we work closely with the government to define the scope and amount of work required based upon an estimate of the maximum amount that the government desires to spend 
while the scope is often not initially fully defined or requires any specific amount of work  once the project scope is determined  additional work may be awarded to us without the need for further competitive bidding 
guaranteed maximum price contracts  or gmax contracts  are performed in a manner similar to cost reimbursable contracts except that the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price 
we can be responsible for some or all of the total cost of the project if the cost exceeds the guaranteed maximum price 
where the total cost is less than the negotiated guaranteed maximum price  we will receive the benefit of the cost savings based upon a negotiated agreement with the client 

table of contents fixed price contracts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum contracts 
under negotiated fixed price contracts  we are selected as contractor first  and then we negotiate price with the client 
these types of contracts generally occur where we commence work before a final price is agreed upon 
under lump sum contracts  we competitively bid based upon specifications provided by the client  agreeing to develop a project at a fixed price 
another type of fixed price contract is a so called unit price contract under which we are paid a set amount for every unit of work performed 
in some fixed price contracts  we can benefit from some of the cost savings depending upon whether the client is willing to bear some of the risk if the actual cost exceeds the contract award 
as a result  if we perform well  we can benefit from cost savings  however  if the project does not proceed as originally planned  we cannot recover for cost overruns except in certain limited situations 
competition we are one of the world s larger providers of engineering  procurement and construction services 
the markets served by our business are highly competitive and for the most part require substantial resources  particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
a large number of companies are competing in the markets served by the business  including us based companies such as the bechtel group  inc  jacobs engineering group  halliburton s kellogg brown root  cb i  chm hill companies  parsons engineering and washington group international  and international companies such as foster wheeler  technip and amec 
in the engineering and construction arena  our competition is primarily centered on performance and the ability to provide the design  engineering  planning  management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe  timely and cost efficient manner 
our engineering  procurement and construction business derives its competitive strength from our diversity  reputation for quality  technology  cost effectiveness  worldwide procurement capability  project management expertise  geographic coverage and ability to meet client requirements by performing construction on either a union or an open shop basis  ability to execute projects of varying sizes  strong safety record and lengthy experience with a wide range of services and technologies 
the various markets served by the global services segment  while containing some similarities  tend also to have discrete issues particularly impacting that unit 
each of the markets we serve has a large number of companies competing in its markets 
in the equipment sector  which operates in numerous markets  the equipment industry is highly fragmented and very competitive  with most competitors operating in specific geographic areas 
the competition for larger capital project services is more narrow and limited to only those capable of providing comprehensive equipment  tool and management services 
temporary staffing is a highly fragmented market with over  companies competing nationally 
the key competitive factors in this business line are price  service  quality  breadth of service  and the ability to identify and retain qualified personnel and geographical coverage 
the barriers to entry in operations and maintenance are both financially and logistically low with the result that the industry is highly fragmented with no single company being dominant 
competition is generally driven by reputation  price and the capacity to perform 
key competitive factors in our government segment are primarily centered on performance and the ability to provide the design  engineering  planning  management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe  timely and cost efficient manner 
significant customers for  and  revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the united states federal government accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
however  we are not dependent on any single federal agency or upon any other single customer on an on going basis  and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business 
except for the united states federal government  no other single customer accounted for over of our revenues in either of the last two years 
raw materials the principal raw materials we use in our business include structural steel  metal plate and concrete 
these and the other raw materials and the components we use and which are necessary for the conduct of our business are generally available from numerous sources 
we do not foresee any unavailability of raw materials and components that would have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term 
however  the price and availability of these raw materials and components 
table of contents may vary significantly from year to year due to various factors including customer demand  producer capacity  market conditions and material shortages and costs 
research and development while we engage in research and development efforts in the development of new products and services  during the past three fiscal years  we have not incurred costs for company sponsored research and development activities which would be material  special or unusual in any of our business segments 
patents we hold patents and licenses for certain items that we use in our operations 
however  none is so essential that its loss would materially effect our business 
environmental  safety and health matters we believe  based upon present information available to us  that our accruals with respect to future environmental costs are adequate and any future costs will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
some factors  however could result in additional expenditures or the provision of additional accruals in expectation of such expenditures 
these include the imposition of more stringent requirements under environmental laws or regulations  new developments or changes regarding site cleanup costs or the allocation of such costs among potentially responsible parties  or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at sites other than those currently identified 
number of employees the following table sets forth the number of employees of fluor and its subsidiaries engaged in our continuing business segments as of december  total employees oil gas industrial infrastructure government global services power other total with respect to our total number of employees  as of december  we had  salaried employees and  craft and hourly employees 
the number of craft and hourly employees varies in relation to the number and size of projects we have in process at any particular time

company risk factors we bear the risk of cost overruns in approximately of the dollar value of our contracts 
we may experience reduced profits or  in some cases  losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 
we conduct our business under various types of contractual arrangements 
in terms of dollar value  the majority of our contracts allocate the risk of cost overruns to our client by requiring our client to reimburse us for our costs 
approximately of the dollar value of our contracts  however  are guaranteed maximum price or fixed price contracts  where we bear a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns 
under these fixed price contracts  contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates which are based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about future economic conditions  prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other exigencies 
if these estimates prove 
table of contents inaccurate  or circumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems  difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals  changes in local laws or labor conditions  weather delays  cost of raw materials  our suppliers or subcontractors inability to perform  cost overruns may occur  and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
from time to time  we may also assume a project s technical risk  which means that we may have to satisfy certain technical requirements of a project despite the fact that at the time of project award  we may not have previously produced the system or product in question 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
as of december   our backlog was approximately billion 
we cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time 
in addition  project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur  from time to time  with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog 
backlog reductions can adversely affect the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts reflected in our backlog 
future project cancellations and scope adjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues and profits that we actually receive 
finally  poor project or contract performance could also impact our profits 
if we guarantee the timely completion or performance standards of a project  we could incur additional costs to cover our guarantee obligations 
in some instances and in many of our fixed price contracts  we guarantee a customer that we will complete a project by a scheduled date 
we sometimes provide that the project  when completed  will also achieve certain performance standards 
if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled  or if the project subsequently fails to meet guaranteed performance standards  we may be held responsible for cost impacts to the client resulting from any delay or the costs to cause the project to achieve the performance standards  generally in the form of contractually agreed upon liquidated damages 
to the extent that these events occur  the total costs of the project would exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
the nature of our engineering and construction business exposes us to potential liability claims and contract disputes which may reduce our profits 
we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities where design  construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties 
we have been and may in future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters 
these claims generally arise in the normal course of our business 
when it is determined that we have liability  we may not be covered by insurance or  if covered  the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
our professional liability coverage is on a claims made basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect 
in addition  even where insurance is maintained for such exposures  the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims 
any liability not covered by our insurance  in excess of our insurance limits or  if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible  could result in a significant loss for us  which may reduce our profits and cash available for operations 
we have seen an increase in our claims against project owners for payment and our failure to recover adequately on these and future claims could have a material effect on us 
we have over the past few years seen an increase in the volume and the amount of claims brought by us against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price 
these types of claims occur due to matters such as owner caused delays or changes from the initial project scope  which result in additional costs  both direct and indirect 
often  these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings  and it is difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved 
when these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending  we have used significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims  as in the case of our hamaca project 
in connection with disputes relating to the hamaca project  we have deferred approximately million of incurred costs  as of december  if we fail to obtain a favorable judgment or are unable to collect any awards from a favorable judgment  our profits and financial 
table of contents condition could be materially and adversely affected 
a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition 
we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve 
the demand for our services and products is dependent upon the existence of projects with engineering  procurement  construction and management needs 
although downturns can impact our entire business  our telecommunications and power markets exemplify businesses that are cyclical in nature and continue to be affected by a decrease in worldwide demand for these projects during the past year 
industries such as these and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns and are cyclical in nature 
as a result  our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in these industries 
we have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties 
unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions  increased costs and potential losses 
our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and to changing domestic and international economic and political conditions which are beyond our control 
as of december   approximately of our projected backlog consisted of engineering and construction revenues to be derived from facilities to be constructed in other countries  we expect that a significant portion of our revenues and profits will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeable future 
operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations  embargoes  united states government policies  and international hostilities 
the lack of a well developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights 
we also face significant risks due to civil strife  acts of war  terrorism and insurrection 
our level of exposure to these risks will vary with respect to each project  depending on the particular stage of each such project 
for example  our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development stage will generally be less than our risk exposure with respect to a project in the middle of construction 
to the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions  we may experience project disruptions and losses 
project disruptions and losses could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
we work in international locations where there are high security risks  which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated costs 
some of our services are performed in high risk locations  such as iraq and venezuela  where the country or location is suffering from political  social or economic issues  or war or civil unrest 
in those locations where we have employees or operations  we may incur substantial costs such as security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel 
moreover  despite these activities  in these locations  we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel 

table of contents our government contracts may be terminated at any time 
also  if we do not comply with restrictions and regulations imposed by the government  our government contracts may be terminated and we may be unable to enter into future government contracts 
the termination of our government contracts could significantly reduce our expected revenues 
we enter into significant government contracts  from time to time  such as those that we have with the us department of energy at fernald and hanford 
government contracts are subject to various uncertainties  restrictions and regulations  including oversight audits by government representatives and profit and cost controls 
government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with congressional funding 
the government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for a program may even be eliminated 
in addition  government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio economic requirements 
for example  we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation far  the truth in negotiations act  the cost accounting standards cas  the service contract act and department of defense security regulations 
we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices  environmental protection  recordkeeping and accounting 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  requirements or statutes  our existing government contracts could be terminated  and we could be temporarily suspended or even debarred from government contracting or subcontracting 
we also run the risk of the impact of government audits  investigations and proceedings  and so called qui tam actions that  if an unfavorable result occurs  could impact our profits and financial condition  as well as our ability to obtain future government work 
for example  government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency the dcaa routinely review and audit government contractors 
if these agencies determine that a rule or regulation has been violated  a variety of penalties can be imposed including criminal and civil penalties all of which would harm our reputation with the government or even debar us from future government activities 
the dcaa has the ability to review how we have accounted for costs under the far and cas  and if they believe that we have engaged in inappropriate accounting or other activities  payments to us may be disallowed 
if one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason  if we are suspended from government contract work  or if payment of our costs is disallowed  we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits 
our use of the percentage of completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues or profits 
under our accounting procedures  we measure and recognize a large portion of our profits and revenues under the percentage of completion accounting methodology 
this methodology allows us to recognize revenues and profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the costs incurred to date against the total amount of costs expected to be incurred 
the effect of revisions to revenues and estimated costs is recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated  and these revisions can occur at any time and could be material 
on a historical basis  we believe that we have made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on our long term contracts 
however  given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts  it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made  which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits 
we continue to expand our business in areas where bonding is required  but bonding capacity is limited 
we continue to expand our business in areas where the underlying contract must be bonded  especially in the transportation infrastructure arena 
because of the overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity  we can find it difficult to find sureties who will provide the contract required bonding 
in addition  these contracts are often very large and extremely complex  which often necessitates the use of a joint venture  often with a competitor  to bid on and perform these types of contracts  especially since it may be easier to jointly pursue the necessary bonding 
however  entering into these types of joint ventures or partnerships exposes us to the credit and performance risks of third parties  many of whom are not as financially strong as we are 
if our joint venturers or partners fail to perform  we could suffer negative results 

table of contents our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could increase our us dollar costs or reduce our us dollar revenues 
because our functional currency is the us dollar  we generally try to denominate our contracts in united states dollars 
however  from time to time our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies  which results in our foreign operations facing the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our us dollar costs for  or reduce our us dollar revenues from  our foreign operations 
any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits 
intense competition in the engineering and construction industry could reduce our market share and profits 
we serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete  such as the bechtel group  inc  jacobs engineering group  halliburton s kellogg brown root  washington group international  parsons engineering  chm hill companies  cb i  foster wheeler  technip and amec 
in particular  the engineering and construction markets are highly competitive and require substantial resources and capital investment in equipment  technology and skilled personnel 
competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins 
intense competition is expected to continue in these markets  presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins 
if we are unable to meet these competitive challenges  we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits 
the success of our joint ventures depend on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their joint venture obligations 
the failure of our joint venture partners to perform their joint venture obligations could impose on us additional financial and performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture 
we enter into various joint ventures as part of our engineering  procurement and construction businesses  such as ica fluor and project specific joint ventures 
the success of these and other joint ventures depend  in large part  on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partners of their joint venture obligations 
if our joint venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their joint venture obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties  the joint venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services 
under these circumstances  we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
these additional obligations could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture 
we could incur substantial tax liabilities if certain representations and warranties made by our predecessor in interest are inaccurate 
prior to the reverse spin off involving our former coal segment  our predecessor in interest received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the reverse spin off qualified as a tax free spin off under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the ruling was granted based upon certain representations made by our predecessor in interest 
while we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause those representations to be incorrect or incomplete  if those representations were inaccurate  it is possible that the ruling would no longer be valid 
in such event  we could incur a significant corporate tax liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
past and future environmental  safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits 
we are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations 
our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which  if improperly handled or disposed of  could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities 
it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial  legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations 
the applicable regulations  as well as the technology and length of time available to comply with those regulations  continue to develop and change 
in addition  past activities could also have a material impact on us 
for example  when we sold our mining business formerly conducted through st 
joe minerals corporation  we retained responsibility for certain non lead related environmental liabilities  but only to the extent that such liabilities were not covered by st 
joe s comprehensive 
table of contents general liability insurance 
while we are not currently aware of any material exposure arising from our former st 
joe s business or otherwise  the costs of complying with rulings and regulations or satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we are found responsible could be substantial and could reduce our profits 
we are also subject to a number of asbestos related lawsuits 
if we experience delays and or defaults in customer payments  we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover all expenditures 
because of the nature of our contracts  at times we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on client projects as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment 
if a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources  it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 
our recent and any future acquisitions may not be successful 
we expect to continue to pursue selective acquisitions of businesses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions will be successful 
acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
we also may encounter difficulties integrating acquisitions and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 
we are a delaware corporation 
various anti takeover provisions under delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
in addition  certain provisions of our bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover 
for example our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms  vacancies on the board can only be filled by other directors  there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election  and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares 
these types of provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
accordingly  shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares 
as a holding company  we are dependent on our subsidiaries for cash distributions to fund debt payments 
because we are a holding company  we have no true operations nor significant assets other than the stock we own of our subsidiaries 
we depend on dividends  loans and other distributions from these subsidiaries for us to be able to pay our debt and other financial obligations 
contractual limitations and legal regulations may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make such distributions or loans to us or  if made  may be insufficient to cover our financial obligations  or to pay interest or principal when due on our debt 
we maintain a workforce based upon current and anticipated workloads 
if we do not receive future contract awards or if these awards are delayed  significant costs may result 
our estimates of future performance depend on  among other matters  whether and when we will receive certain new contract awards 
while our estimates are based upon our good faith judgment  these estimates can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information 
in the case of large scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain  it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when we will receive a contract award 
the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contract needs 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we could incur costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that would have the effect of reducing our profits 

table of contents our credit facilities restrict our ability and the ability of some of our subsidiaries to engage in certain business activities 
on july   we entered into a new senior unsecured credit facility which provides for the financing of our business operations for up to million in both loans and other financial commitments 
this credit facility places certain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to  among other things  incur additional debt beyond specified limits  create or permit liens  consolidate or merge  make material changes in the nature or conduct of our business  or transfer or sell assets 
this credit facility contains relatively standard provisions for companies similar to us in size and credit rating 
our ability to continue to borrow under this credit facility depends upon the satisfaction of covenants  some of which are beyond our control to satisfy 
if we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this credit facility  we could be called into default which  if not cured or waived  would allow the lender to accelerate repayment of the debt 
we cannot be certain that we can remedy all defaults  and if our debt repayment is accelerated  we may not have the ability to either pay back or refinance the debt

table of contents item legal proceedings fluor and its subsidiaries  as part of their normal business activities  are parties to a number of legal proceedings and other matters in various stages of development 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  in our opinion and based on reports of counsel  any liability arising from these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial position  or the results of operations of the company  after giving effect to provisions already recorded 
in addition to the matters described above  we are involved in disputes with respect to the hamaca crude upgrader project located in jose  venezuela 
we are part of a joint venture which is actively proceeding on a number of issues under binding arbitration to recover certain costs we have incurred with respect to this project and  if we are not successful in this arbitration  it could have a material adverse effect on us

in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin or the interpretation 
fin expands on the accounting and disclosure requirements under existing accounting standards 
it clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation 
disclosures required by the interpretation are provided below in the financial position and liquidity section of this management s discussion and analysis and in the footnotes to the accompanying financial statements 
the accounting requirements of the interpretation are applicable to transactions entered into beginning january  application of this interpretation did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position in or in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
fin r provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary 
in general  a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
the company s engineering office facilities in aliso viejo  california aliso viejo and calgary  canada calgary were leased through arrangements involving variable interest entities 
beginning in the first quarter of  the company consolidated these entities in its financial statements as prescribed by fin r 
at december   the effect of this consolidation resulted in an increase of million and million in reported short term and long term debt  respectively  and an increase in property  plant and equipment of million 
none of the terms of the leasing arrangements or the company s obligations as a lessee were impacted by this change in accounting 
the cumulative impact of the difference in earnings  amounting to a charge of million net of tax  relating to prior years was reported in the first quarter of as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during  the company exercised options to purchase both the aliso viejo million and calgary million engineering and office facilities 
these amounts are reported as repayments of facilities financing in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows 
contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionally consolidated in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures eitf and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
the company evaluates the applicability of fin r to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards 

table of contents on december   the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
in may  the fasb issued staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp providing guidance on accounting for the effects of the act and specific disclosure requirements 
based on an analysis of the act  the company has concluded that its retiree medical plans provide benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the company adopted the provisions of fsp as of july  and recorded the effects of the subsidy in measuring net periodic postretirement benefit cost during the quarter ended september  this resulted in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related to benefits attributed to past service of million and a pretax reduction in net periodic postretirement benefit costs of million for the second half of the year 
in september  the eitf reached a final consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share issue  that became effective for the company on december  contingently convertible debt instruments commonly referred to as co cos are financial instruments that add a contingent feature to a convertible debt instrument 
the conversion feature is triggered when one or more specified contingencies occur and at least one of these contingencies is based on market price 
prior to the issuance of the final consensus on issue no 
by the eitf  the company applied a widely held interpretation that statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share  allowed the exclusion of common shares underlying contingently convertible debt instruments from the calculation of diluted earnings per share eps in instances where conversion depends on the achievement of a specified market price of the issuer s shares and such price had not been attained 
issue requires that these underlying common shares be included in the diluted eps computations  if dilutive  regardless of whether the market price contingency or any other contingent factor has been met 
however  principal amounts that must be settled entirely in cash may be excluded from the computations 
prior to the end of  the company irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash  and therefore  there will be no dilutive impact until the average price of the company s stock exceeds the conversion price of 
subsequent to december   the conversion price has been exceeded 
if the company s stock price is in excess of the conversion price as of march   the company will then use the treasury stock method of accounting for the excess of the market stock price over in calculating diluted eps 
upon conversion  any stock appreciation amount above the conversion price of will be satisfied by the company through the issuance of common stock which thereafter will be included in calculating both basic and diluted eps 
because the company has irrevocably elected to pay the principal amount of the debt in cash  previously reported diluted eps for the first  second  and third quarters of will not change as a result of the consensus on issue in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
upon adoption of sfas r  pro forma disclosure of the impact of share based payments to employees is no longer permitted 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company expects to adopt sfas r on january   using the modified retrospective method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method pursuant to apb and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have an impact on results of operations  although it will have no impact on overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r will not be material based on unvested options outstanding at december  had sfas r been adopted in prior periods  the impact would be as presented in the disclosure of pro forma earnings and earnings per share in the stock plan footnote under major accounting policies in the 
table of contents accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
this requirement will generally impact cash provided or utilized by operating activities with offsets in cash flows from financing activities in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
discussion of critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply the following critical accounting policies 
engineering and construction contracts engineering and construction contract revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
this method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials  labor costs and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes  or achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract costs and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
the majority of the company s engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in the highly competitive markets served by the company  there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
as of december   percent of the company s backlog was cost reimbursable while percent was for guaranteed maximum  fixed or unit price contracts 
in certain instances  the company has provided guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs  which could exceed revenues realized from the projects 
claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients  and the company has made certain claims against clients for costs 
the company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred costs when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated 
recognized claims amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
in circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenues cannot be reliably estimated  costs attributable to change orders are deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price 
backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress 
although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations  deferrals and revised project scope and costs  both upward and downward 
engineering and construction partnerships and joint ventures certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties 
the company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportional consolidation basis 
under this method of accounting  the company consolidates its proportional share of venture revenues  costs and operating profits in the consolidated statement of earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant application of the proportional consolidation method is in the power  oil gas and industrial infrastructure segments 
the company s accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established 
the company 
table of contents engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution 
frequently  these arrangements are characterized by a percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment 
execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements 
when the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution  the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenues using appropriate contract accounting principles 
foreign currency the company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in us dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred 
as a result  the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed 
under certain limited circumstances  such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives 
as of december  and  the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts 
managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies 
the company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure 
the objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made 
the company does not engage in currency speculation 
in connection with the hamaca crude upgrader project located in jose  venezuela  the company has incurred foreign currency exposures and related translation losses due to weakness in the venezuelan bolivar compared with the us dollar 
see additional discussion concerning the hamaca project below under results of operations oil gas 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
at december  the company had deferred tax assets of million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
this allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards  net operating and capital loss carryforwards for us and us subsidiaries  and certain project performance reserves 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended sfas 
as permitted by sfas  changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods 
assumptions concerning discount rates  long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period 
the company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations and other factors 
recent decreases in long term interest rates have the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved  future funding obligations could increase substantially 
assuming no changes in current assumptions  the company expects to fund between million and million for the calendar year if the discount rate were reduced by basis points  plan liabilities would increase by approximately million 

table of contents results of operations summary of overall company results during  revenue and earnings from continuing operations increased by percent and percent  respectively  compared with revenue of the oil gas segment was favorably impacted during the year by increased work performed associated with the transition to field activities on two major international projects 
additionally  a positive trend for new awards in the government segment resulted in a significant increase in work performed in iraq on projects for the us government in the company also benefited from increased revenues beginning in the first quarter of from business acquisitions completed in and early offsetting these improvements has been a continued trend away from power projects 
revenues and earnings from continuing operations were also negatively impacted by the lower level of new project awards in the economically sensitive mining  chemicals and manufacturing markets experienced in in addition  the company s decision to suspend performance on a mining project and withdraw from certain commercial projects had a negative impact on backlog and the volume of work performed in revenue declined percent in compared with primarily due to declines in the power and oil gas segments 
earnings from continuing operations increased percent primarily due to the improved performance of the government  industrial infrastructure and global services segments 
also contributing to the improvement was lower reported corporate administrative and general expense due to the absence of several non operating charges that were included in  and a lower tax rate on earnings from continuing operations 
the company experienced a significant decline in power segment revenue and earnings over the last two years as projects in the segment were completed and the contribution from new awards declined due to the cyclical downward trend in the demand for new power plant construction 
partially offsetting this trend in power is an increasing trend for new awards in the industrial infrastructure and government segments 
following a low level in  new awards in the oil gas segment have rebounded in and the company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in the early stages of a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next three to five years 
new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment increased significantly in and were distributed primarily across the mining  chemicals and life sciences markets  reflecting improved economics supporting capital spending commitments 
in addition  the trend for new awards in the government segment has increased due to awards for work in iraq as well as the completion of the acquisitions of the international division of ja jones construction company ja jones and trend western technical corporation trend western 
these acquisitions improve the company s service offering to both the department of state and department of defense 
earnings from continuing operations before taxes for the three years ended december  were million  million and million  respectively 
because of the decline in power segment earnings  which related largely to projects located in the united states  domestic operating profit declined significantly during  offset by increases in foreign operating profits 
the company had net earnings of per share in compared with per share in and in results in were negatively impacted by a loss from discontinued operations of per share and a loss of per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
results in include a loss from discontinued operations of per share 
the results of discontinued operations are further discussed below 
the loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is discussed above under accounting pronouncements 
following is a discussion of the operating performance of each business segment  corporate administrative and general expense and other items 
the company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering  procurement  construction and maintenance epcm and is organized into five business segments oil gas  industrial infrastructure  government  global services and power 
the oil gas segment provides engineering and construction professional services for upstream oil and gas production  downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets 
the industrial infrastructure segment provides engineering and construction professional services for manufacturing and life sciences facilities  commercial and institutional buildings  mining  microelectronics  chemicals  telecommunications and transportation projects and other facilities 
the government segment provides project management  engineering  construction  and contingency response services to the united states government 
the global services segment includes operations and maintenance  
table of contents construction equipment  temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement services 
the power segment provides professional services to engineer and construct power generation facilities 
through the second quarter of  services provided by the power segment were conducted through two joint ventures  duke fluor daniel  a percent owned partnership with duke energy  and ica fluor daniel ica fluor  a percent owned joint venture with grupo ica  a mexican company 
as a result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ica fluor  commencing in the third quarter of  its operating results  new awards and backlog are included in the oil gas segment 
prior periods have not been restated for the change in segment classification of ica fluor 
in july  the company jointly announced with duke energy corporation the decision to terminate the duke fluor daniel partnership d fd as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants 
the dissolution is not expected to have a material impact on results of operations or financial position of the company 
the dissolution is in progress and is expected to be completed in as remaining project activities are concluded 
the company has continued to identify and pursue power generation opportunities and future projects will be performed percent by fluor 
oil gas revenue in the oil gas segment amounted to billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the percent increase during resulted from a global increase in project activity which includes the impact of the transition to field activities on two major international projects where the volume of labor  material and subcontract work is greatest 
the decrease in revenue during reflects the completion of several projects during the year and revenue recognition from projects awarded in that did not fully replace the revenue on the completed projects 
operating profit margin in the oil gas segment increased slightly  to percent in compared with the operating profit margin in increased to percent compared with percent in due to the higher content of project completions combined with improved execution performance 
a major project that has reached mechanical completion in the oil gas segment is the hamaca crude upgrader project hamaca located in jose  venezuela 
hamaca is a billion lump sum project including million of approved change orders of grupo alvica ga  a joint venture including fluor daniel percent and inelectra ca percent  to design and build a petroleum upgrader for a consortium of owners called petrolera ameriven pa including petroleos de venezuela sa  chevrontexaco and conocophillips 
the ga joint venture is pursuing cost and schedule relief through arbitration proceedings for the following three issues modifications and extra work arising from differing site soil conditions  costs arising from the site labor agreement for called acta convenio and events in venezuela in early  including a national strike and other force majeure incidents 
arbitration proceedings were commenced by ga in late the site soil conditions issue was the subject of arbitration hearings in november there are no monetary cross claims by pa in the arbitration 
the amount of the claim for site soil conditions of million includes the direct costs as well as significant delay related and indirect costs 
in april  the arbitration panel awarded ga million for direct cost of the site soil conditions remediation work  virtually all of the amounts sought by ga for this issue 
the client had previously conditionally accepted responsibility relating to the soil conditions matter and million had been paid 
the balance of the award amount was received in april the award confirmed ga s methodology for computing the amount of all change orders arising under the contract 
in addition  the award also granted ga approximately weeks of schedule relief 
the delay and indirect costs were the subject of hearings in june and a decision is expected shortly 
the hearings on the fundamental cost differences between the earlier labor agreement and the acta convenio were held in april and a decision on this issue is also expected shortly 
the amount of the claim for acta convenio is million and no payments have been made by the client relating to this matter 
in accordance with the contract  the joint venture is entitled to cost and schedule relief for the impact of the national strike in venezuela 
a change order relating to the national strike in the approximate amount of million was submitted by ga 
this action was followed by the filing of an arbitration claim relating to this issue in january hearings on this issue are now scheduled for march and april other force majeure incidents occurring prior to the national strike also were the subject of arbitration hearings in october 
table of contents incurred costs associated with delay and indirect costs related to the soil conditions  acta convenio  the national strike and other claims are probable of being recovered and thus are being deferred 
these costs will be recognized in revenue when a change order is approved or payment is received 
as of december   incurred costs amounting to million have been deferred 
subcontractor close outs will result in additional costs as contracts are settled 
the company believes that schedule relief awarded in connection with the direct costs of the site soil conditions  along with other delay days requested on the other issues  will be sufficient to avoid the imposition of liquidated damages 
if costs relating to acta convenio  soil conditions  the national strike or other claims are determined to be not recoverable or liquidated damages are assessed  the company could face materially reduced profits or losses on this project  along with lower levels of cash and additional borrowings 
new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in  roughly equal to the billion in new awards in increased percent compared with billion in new project awards in included a million oil sands project and a million clean fuels project  which are both in canada  a million refinery complex modernization project in mexico and a million refinery upgrade project in south africa 
new project awards in include the tengizchevroil tco project  a major oil and gas development in kazakhstan 
the increase in new awards is partly attributable to the tco project which was expected to be awarded in but was temporarily suspended due to funding considerations that were resolved early in also included in new awards in is the sakhalin i program and construction management project led by exxonmobil and a project for lukoil  a major russian oil company 
the lower level of new awards in was primarily due to the previously mentioned temporary suspension of the tco project 
the large size and uncertain timing of complex  international projects can create variability in the segment s award pattern  consequently  future award trends are difficult to predict with certainty 
backlog for the oil gas segment was billion at december   an increase of percent compared with billion at december  the backlog growth included the impacts of new awards and the reclassification of ica fluor during the year 
the billion backlog at december  compared with billion at december  this increase was due to the higher level of new awards in and the lower level of work performed on these new awards that were in the early stages of project execution where activity is focused on engineering and project planning 
total assets in the oil gas segment increased to million at december  compared with million at december  the increase includes the impact of the growth in segment revenues  as well as increased deferred costs on the hamaca project of million 
industrial infrastructure the industrial infrastructure segment had revenues of billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the percent decline in revenues during resulted from slow start up progress on recently awarded projects and a lower level of new awards in the latter half of in addition  as discussed below  certain projects that were removed from backlog in the third quarter of also had a negative impact on the volume of work performed in the percent increase in revenues during primarily reflects the higher volume of work performed on life sciences projects awarded in partially offset by lower volume of work performed on mining projects as a number of projects were completed in operating profit margin for the industrial infrastructure segment increased to percent in compared with percent in operating profit for the segment has been impacted in all three years by provisions relating to specific projects 
during  a million provision due to estimated cost overruns resulting in a loss on a transportation infrastructure project was partially offset by a million positive impact from recovery of insurance proceeds relating to the verde gold project  which is further discussed below 
in operating profit was negatively impacted by a million charge relating to the write down of an equity investment in a magnesium smelter project in australia 
the investment was committed in previous years as part of a consulting arrangement with the client wherein the company agreed to be compensated for its services in shares of the client s capital stock 
due to funding considerations  continued development of the project was suspended  resulting in the client seeking bankruptcy protection 
because the company was not the execution contractor there was no impact on backlog or operating results from project execution 
the operating profit margin in the industrial infrastructure segment was essentially flat with in margins were reduced by the equity investment write down discussed above  a higher volume of construction management work which has reduced margins due to lower risk and lack of project margin on projects that were removed from backlog which are discussed further below 
a million dispute resolution provision in primarily relates to an unfavorable 
table of contents arbitration ruling on the verde gold project in chile  a gold ore processing facility completed in during the second quarter of  the company recognized a loss provision from verde gold of million representing the arbitration award plus applicable interest  less a million reserve provided in prior years and expected insurance recoveries 
the net impact on results of operations for was a charge of million 
new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment increased to billion during  compared with billion during and billion in new awards in include a variety of mining  pharmaceuticals  chemicals and manufacturing projects throughout the world 
the decline in new awards in resulted from economic weakness in the mining  telecommunications and manufacturing markets reflecting overcapacity and poor commodity pricing in these industries 
new awards in included a substantial award for the sh toll road project in texas 
backlog for the industrial infrastructure segment grew to billion during following a decline to billion at the end of  compared with billion at december  the growth during was reflective of the substantial new awards during the year 
contributing to the decline was the removal of million for three projects that had been booked during the previous two years 
one of these was a mining project that was removed due to considerations relating to ongoing financing 
the other two were commercial projects that the company decided not to execute due to evolving changes in industry liability 
government the government segment had revenues of billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the percent increase in revenue during resulted principally from reconstruction activity in iraq  strong performance on environmental remediation programs for the department of energy doe  and businesses acquired over the last two years 
del jen  inc del jen was acquired late in the first quarter of and ja jones was acquired in the fourth quarter of in addition  trend western was acquired by del jen in the first quarter of in total  these acquired businesses contributed million of revenue in  compared with million from the acquired businesses in in addition to the impact of business acquisitions  the percent increase during included a substantial increase in work performed for the department of defense on the midcourse missile defense test bed facilities in alaska  the department of state for an embassy project in brazil and new awards for task orders in iraq 
revenue in all periods includes work for ongoing environmental restoration  engineering  construction  site operations and maintenance services at two major doe sites the fernald environmental management project fernald in ohio and the hanford environmental management project in washington 
the operating profit margin for the government segment was percent during  up from percent during this improvement reflects improved contract performance and a higher level of costs related to proposal activity in the prior year 
operating profit margin for the government segment declined to percent in compared with percent in contributing to this decline was the impact of a particularly high level of proposal costs during as the segment pursued a number of new opportunities 
many projects performed on behalf of us government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding 
as a result  new awards for the government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing months 
total assets in the government segment increased to million at december  compared with million at december  the segment has recognized unbilled fees totaling million related to the fernald project 
the project has moved into the closeout stage and contract terms provide that a portion of the earned fees will not be billed until project completion in deferred fees recognized in revenue in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
also contributing to the increase in segment assets was a significant increase in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to projects performed in the middle east 
global services the global services segment had revenues of billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the percent growth during was primarily the result of increased operations and maintenance activity 
the percent increase in revenue in includes million from plant performance services ps  which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of that year 
revenue during also reflects the impact of selectivity to improve margins and depressed economic conditions resulting in lower operations and maintenance activity in the manufacturing sector during that year 

table of contents operating profit margin in the global services segment was percent  percent and percent  and  respectively 
the declines during and were the combined result of lower levels of company wide construction activity  which impacted the segment s construction equipment business  and reduced margins that resulted from competitive factors in the operations and maintenance business 
new awards in the global services segment for operations and maintenance projects increased percent  to billion during  compared to billion during a significant multi year contract for a new client in the united kingdom was awarded during the fourth quarter of new awards for of billion represented an increase of percent over this increase is primarily due to the contribution from ps  as well as a lower level of new awards in that was attributable to increased selectivity and the depressed economic conditions in the manufacturing sector 
backlog for the global services segment increased by percent  to billion  at december   compared with billion at december  this growth was principally the result of the large new award discussed in the preceding paragraph 
in previous years  backlog was fairly stable at billion at december  and billion as of december  this relative stability is due in part to the multi year nature of operations and maintenance contracts where consistent and efficient performance results in long term client relationships 
the equipment  temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement operations do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue 
accordingly  new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only 
power the power segment has experienced significant declines in revenue during recent years  to million during from million for the year ended december  and billion in this decline is due to the substantial work off of projects in backlog that were awarded in prior years 
the segment has experienced a substantial reduction in new awards over the last several years as demand for new power generation has diminished following a strong cycle of power plant construction activity 
as a result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ica fluor  commencing in the third quarter of  its operating results  new awards and backlog are included in the oil gas segment rather than the power segment where it was previously reported 
operating profit margin in the power segment declined to percent during from a very strong percent for the year ended december  the current year performance was negatively impacted by the completion of a major cycle of investment in power projects and unexpected costs associated with the start up and commissioning of a waste coal power plant during the third quarter of the year 
operating profit margin during was percent 
although operating profit declined in to million compared to million in due to the decline in the power market  the strong margin performance in was attributable to highly successful execution resulting in early completion of projects 
projects in the power segment are primarily bid and awarded on a fixed price basis 
this method of contracting exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays 
new awards in the power segment recovered somewhat during  to million from million for two awards during the fourth quarter were the largest contributors to this growth 
one was for the recommissioning of a power plant in south africa and the other was for the completion of a partially constructed natural gas fired plant in nevada 
new awards declined to million for the year ended december   compared with billion in backlog for the power segment decreased to million at december  compared with million at december  and million at december  the decline includes the impact of the movement of ica fluor to the oil gas segment 
most of the projects awarded in prior years have now been completed 
new award activity for the near term future is expected to be modest as existing power generation capacity is expected to meet anticipated demand 
corporate for the year ended december  corporate administrative and general expenses were million  compared with million in the prior year 
included in the amount are non operating pretax gains of million related to the final disposal of a residual interest in a property that was sold by the company in and million from real estate sales

table of contents compared with primarily due to higher management incentive compensation costs 
non operating items in included charges relating to the reevaluation of the company s enterprise resource management erm system  recognition of a provision for a guarantee obligation and a provision to recognize impairment related to an investment in the beacon group energy investment fund  lp that were recognized in that year 
partially offsetting these charges in was the recognition of a gain relating to the demutualization of an insurance company in which the company had an investment 
during significant cost reductions were realized as a result of the company s reevaluation of the scope of implementation and deployment of its erm system formerly known as knowledge work 
as part of this reevaluation effort the company altered the original erm implementation plan and recognized a charge of million in for abandonment of certain system functionality and to adjust depreciation expense 
this charge partially offset the impact of the cost reductions realized upon changing the implementation and deployment plan 
net interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
lower net interest income in and compared with is primarily the result of lower cash balances and increased short term borrowings 
the effective tax rates on the company s continuing operations were percent  percent and percent for the years  and  respectively 
the slight rise in the tax rate in compared with is primarily due to the increase in non deductible expenses as well as capital and foreign losses that received no tax benefits 
such increase  however  was partially offset by the decrease in state income taxes largely attributable to the utilization of prior year net operating losses in california  which losses were suspended in and due to the state s deficit position 
in addition  during the company disposed of certain business assets  which resulted in a favorable effective tax rate variance due to certain permanent book tax basis differences 
the tax rate in compared with was lower substantially due to the tax benefits from favorable tax return adjustments and settlements

the company expects the net effect of the phase out of the eti and the phase in of this new deduction to result in an increase in its effective tax rate for fiscal years and of approximately one to two percentage points  based on anticipated earnings levels 
in the long term  the company does not expect to receive significant tax benefits from this new qualified domestic production deduction due to a shift of project mix to more international projects 
under the guidance in fasb staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the act  the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in fasb statement no
