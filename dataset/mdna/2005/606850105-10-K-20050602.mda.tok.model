multipurpose room furniture 
the company s multipurpose room furniture line consists of lightweight  durable  folding leg tables  stacking and folding chairs  lecterns  portable partitions  and other related products 
these products are used in multipurpose rooms of educational  recreational  hotel and hospitality  government  office  healthcare  religious and other public assembly facilities 
historically  growth in this segment has come from an expanding base of new customers  from increasing sales to existing customers and from expansion of the company s multipurpose room product line 
the current and future growth of the company s multipurpose room furniture operations is largely dependent upon its ability to successfully introduce and market new product lines of multipurpose room furniture and its ability to profitably increase its market penetration into existing and new markets 
multipurpose room furniture outlook 
after three years of declines in the office furniture marketplace due to the downturn in the domestic and international economy  the office furniture marketplace started to grow again in calendar year during  industry shipments increased percent over calendar year this trend has continued in the first quarter of calendar year with shipments increasing percent for the office furniture marketplace as compared to the march quarter of for the company s fiscal year ending march   the company experienced growth of percent which outpaced the industry growth during the same time period of percent 
this increase was particularly strong in the fourth quarter with sales volumes increasing by percent as compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
for the current calendar year  industry analysts are estimating that shipments will slow down from the fast pace of the first quarter and are estimating quarterly growth for the remainder of the year of between and percent  bringing the total growth for calendar year to about percent as compared to calendar year the company is encouraged by these forecasts as well as the strengthening of the economy in general  and is cautiously optimistic that the industry will continue its rebound and that the company s multipurpose room sales volumes will likewise continue to grow 
in january  the company announced its intention to cut off funding on its current next generation table 
the company had been developing a table with improved performance characteristics than its existing table 
with the decision to discontinue funding on the new table  the company has refocused its efforts on the existing table to enhance its performance as well as attempt to further drive out costs 
the company is also pursuing uses for the rotational molding facility that was invested in for the new table 
the company believes that it will be able to use this facility initially for contract manufacturing  but ultimately for products designed by the company  which may be outside of its current marketplace 
during the past few years  chair sales have begun to make up a larger portion of the sales of the company s multipurpose room operations 
although table sales still predominate the volume of this operation  much of the increases in sales can be attributed to increases in chair sales 
during the upcoming fiscal year  the company anticipates launching four additional product lines of chairs to complement its existing chair lines 
beyond the upcoming year  the company anticipates developing additional complementary chair lines to continue to grow this portion of its business as well as further penetrating its existing marketplace with its current lines of chairs 
however  the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to successfully develop and launch such chair lines or further penetrate its existing marketplace 
on april   the company purchased the assets of versipanel llc  a privately owned designer  manufacturer and marketer of a variety of portable partitions based in phoenix  arizona 
for the year ended december   versipanel generated sales of approximately million 
the company plans to sell the versipanel products through its existing sales system to current customers 
the company believes that this product will allow it to expand its product line and better penetrate the institutional furniture market 
healthcare seating 
through broda  the company markets a line of healthcare seating products primarily to customers in canada and the united states 
broda s operations are based in waterloo  ontario  canada 
broda focuses on providing products which assist long term care patients with advanced needs due to a debilitating condition or disease  and has developed a line of premium priced geriatric seating products 
broda chairs are serving a very specific niche in the healthcare market and thus are not competing in the commodity oriented general healthcare seating market 
healthcare seating outlook 
the company believes that the specialty healthcare seating market is less subject to economic pressures than the company s multipurpose room furniture operations 
however  the medical and healthcare industry is more subject to regulatory changes that could affect the demand for broda s products 
the company is not aware of any regulatory changes in the near future that would have a substantial and negative impact on this business 
the company s healthcare seating operation s future growth depends largely upon increasing its market penetration into the us market and other foreign markets as well as its ability to successfully introduce new product lines 
general near term outlook 
based on the reasons stated above  the company anticipates that sales volumes during the quarter ending june  will be up to percent higher as compared to the prior year s first quarter 
despite these expectations  the company  for a variety of reasons including those described in risk factors that may affect future operations  may not be successful in achieving this sales level in the first quarter 
discontinued operations 
in november  the company completed its plan for exiting and selling the assets of the specialty office seating and systems segment of its business the centercore and do group businesses 
this plan was originally approved by the company s board of directors on june since that time and in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  the company treated the do group and centercore segment of its operations as a discontinued operation 
at the time that the plan was originally formulated  an estimated  loss was accrued for in the three months ended june  to account for the expected losses on disposal and estimated operating losses through the disposal date 
after the completion of the plan  the actual net loss  after tax was determined to be  since the amount of loss that was originally estimated and accrued for in the june quarter of  was higher than this amount  the company recognized a gain  net of tax  of  in the three month period ended december  the sale of the assets of this segment was completed in three transactions 
the first two transactions took place in september and october the final transaction occurred in november critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and footnotes 
the critical accounting policies for the company which require management to make judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the reserve for obsolete inventory  accruals for warranty expense  values for the discontinued operations  assets related to the discontinued next generation table line see note  impairment of assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  notes receivable  income taxes  pension liability and wage dispute  and revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company exercises considerable judgment in determining the ultimate collectability of its accounts receivable 
several factors are used in making these judgments including the customer credit quality  historical write off experience and current economic trends 
the company reviews these factors quarterly  and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  an additional allowance may be required 
reserve for obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market 
additionally  the company evaluates its inventory reserves in terms of excess and obsolete exposures 
this evaluation includes such factors as anticipated usage  inventory turnover and ultimate product sales value see note in the financial statements 
accruals for warranty expense the company s warranty service costs for fiscal years ended march    and totaled percent of net sales or  percent of net sales or  and percent of net sales or  respectively 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
this warranty obligation is affected by failure rates  the introduction of new products  and the costs of material and labor to repair or replace the product 
the company regularly assesses the adequacy of its accrual for warranty expense based upon historical warranty rates and anticipated future warranty rates 
values for the discontinued operations on november   the company completed its plan for exiting and selling the assets of the specialty office seating and systems segment of its business 
this plan was originally approved by the company s board of directors on june  during the quarter ended june   the company developed and approved a plan for exiting and selling the specialty office seating and systems furniture segment of its operations 
since that time and in accordance with apb  the company has treated the do group and centercore segment of its operations as a discontinued operation 
at the time that the plan was originally formulated  an estimated  loss was accrued for in the three months ended june  to account for the expected losses on disposal and estimated operating losses through the disposal date 
after the completion of the plan  the actual net loss  after tax has been determined to be  since the amount of loss that was originally estimated and accrued for in the june quarter of  was higher than this amount  the company recognized a gain  net of tax  of  in the period ended december  the company did retain certain assets and liabilities of the segment after completion of the sales plan 
considerable judgment was used to estimate the value of these assets and liabilities based on many factors including the net expected realizable value of the remaining accounts receivable  the realization of tax benefits  and potential remaining expenses 
assets related to the discontinued next generation table line due to the decision by the board of directors in january to discontinue the next generation table project  the company has impaired certain long term assets during the quarter ending march  this resulted in an impairment charge of million related to the fixed assets see note  impairment of assets 
the company utilized an outside specialist to help establish the fair value of the assets which involved considerable judgment 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company reviews annually the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
the goodwill arose from the broda and versipanel acquisitions 
the other intangible asset at march  was intellectual property related to certain rights the company obtained to utilize new technology in its next generation table product development efforts 
during the quarter ended june   the company reviewed the goodwill related to the broda acquisition and the intellectual property related to the startup development company 
this review is performed by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
no impairment charges have been recorded related to the broda or versipanel goodwill 
however  due to the decision by the board of directors in january to discontinue the next generation table project  the company has fully impaired the other intangible asset related to this intellectual property during the quarter ended march  this resulted in an impairment charge of  related to other intangible assets in addition to the million related to fixed assets see note to the financial statements 
notes receivable the company reviews its notes receivable to determine likely collectability 
since the notes are with entities without a long history of an ability to create future cash flows  the company bases its belief in their collectability upon its understanding of what the liquidation value of the operation would be and the likelihood of the company being able to recover the outstanding balances 
at this time  the company has created reserves on one of these notes receivable 
due to the level of uncertainty in the success of these entities  these notes receivable ultimately may not be fully realized 
income taxes the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that future earnings will be sufficient to recover deferred tax assets 
pension liability and wage dispute the company has certain alleged obligations of up to million related to a defined benefit pension plan and million related to a wage dispute resulting from exiting and selling its specialty office seating and systems business 
the company does not believe that it is liable for these amounts and plans to vigorously defend its positions 
at this time  the company is unable to determine what its liability will be 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  as revised by sab no 
sales are recorded when title passes and collectability is reasonably assured under its various shipping terms 
revenue is normally recognized upon shipment of goods to customers 
in certain circumstances revenue is not recognized until the goods are received by the customer based on the terms of the sale agreement 
discounts directly related to the sale are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
recently issued financial accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the company has not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas r  but it is expected that the new standard will result in significant stock based compensation expense 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of original sfas on stock compensation awards rather than applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion are shown in note to the financial statements 
although such pro forma effects of applying original sfas may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas r  the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects 
the actual effects of adopting sfas r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by the company to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method as described below chosen for adopting sfas r 
sfas r  as amended by the sec  will be effective for the company s fiscal year beginning april   and requires the use of the modified prospective application method 
under this method  sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas in addition  companies may use the modified retrospective application method 
this method may be applied to all prior years for which the original sfas was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption 
if the modified retrospective application method is applied  financial statements for prior periods shall be adjusted to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards on a consistent basis with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods under the original sfas in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company intends to adopt sfas no 
on april  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin no 
an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 
 as amended  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
fin no 
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
fin no 
applies in the first year or interim period ending after december  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company does not have an interest in any variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of fin no 
did not impact the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity in its statement of financial position 
sfas no 
is effective for new or modified financial instruments beginning june   and for existing instruments beginning august  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the company does not have any derivative instruments and therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

table sales also increased by percent 
international sales for all product lines represented percent and percent of net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent as compared to percent in the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to three factors 
the first was higher labor and overhead costs associated with the attempted startup of manufacturing operations for the company s next generation table 
prior to the decision in january to discontinue the funding on this operation  a considerable amount of labor and overhead costs related to this potential new product line were expended 
these costs account for approximately percentage points of the deterioration in gross margin in the current year as compared to percentage points in the prior year 
the second factor was higher material costs due to increases in almost all of the company s raw materials 
these increases were partially offset by sales price increases that were implemented earlier in the year  but were not enough to fully offset the costs 
material costs as a percentage of sales increased by percentage points 
the third factor was a charge to inventory related to the next generation table project 
this charge reduced its value from cost to its market valuation resulting from the company s decision to discontinue funding this operation

for fiscal  selling expenses were down at percent of net sales as compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
actual expenses increased by million  or percent 
virtually all of this increase was attributable to increases in expenses in the healthcare seating operation primarily due to higher personnel and commission costs on the increased sales volume and higher travel and vehicle expenses 
multipurpose room furniture selling costs were essentially unchanged compared to the prior fiscal year 
higher commission costs on the increased sales volume were offset by lower advertising  literature  and trade show costs 
general and administrative expenses were percent of net sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and percent in actual expenses increased by percent or million in fiscal over fiscal the increase was due to the receipt in the prior year of a settlement in a legal suit as well as higher professional fees in the current year 
this increase was partially offset by lower insurance costs 
actual general and administrative expenses decreased by percent  or million in fiscal over fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a charge in the prior fiscal year of million fully reserving a note receivable to a startup development company 
the decrease was also due to the receipt of a settlement in a law suit as well as lower professional fees 
research and development expenses were percent of sales in fiscal  percent of sales in fiscal  and percent of sales in fiscal for fiscal  actual spending decreased by percent  or million  as compared to fiscal this decrease resulted mainly from lower costs for personnel at the company s multipurpose room operations

this decrease was partially offset by cash of million generated from continuing operations  and the net proceeds related to the exercise of stock options of million 
historically  the company has financed its growth primarily through cash from operations 
the company s subsidiary  broda enterprises  has a line of credit 
the limit on this facility is million 
as of march   no amount was drawn under this facility 
among other restrictions  this credit facility requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and levels of working capital 
as of march   the company was in full compliance with the loan covenants related to this credit facility 
the company s material cash commitments at march  consisted primarily of current liabilities of million to be paid from funds generated from operations 
current liabilities consisted of the following year ended march  accounts payable   accrued payroll and payroll taxes   accrued warranty   deferred revenue  income taxes payable  other   total current liabilities   the company s contractual commitments consisted of two lease agreements for broda s production and office facilities under which it is obligated to pay  canadian approximately us  per month through august the company also leases a building in phoenix  arizona related to its versipanel operations which requires lease payments of  per month through september as of march   the company had no operating leases with terms in excess of one year 
at march   the company also has committed to purchasing  in raw material inventory during the following year 
the company currently believes that cash flow from its current operations together with existing cash reserves and available lines of credit will be sufficient to support its working capital requirements for its existing operations for at least the next months 
the company cannot guarantee that its working capital will be sufficient to support the company s operations 
if the existing cash reserves  cash flow from operations and debt financing are insufficient or if working capital requirements are greater than currently estimated  the company could be required to raise additional capital 
the company may not be capable of raising additional capital or the terms upon which such capital may be available to the company may not be acceptable 
additional sources of equity capital are available to the company through the exercise by holders of outstanding options 
at march   the proceeds which would have been received by the company upon exercise of outstanding options which were exercisable on that date were approximately million 
there is no assurance that such options will be exercised 
impact of inflation and environmental regulations during the fiscal year ended march   the company has experienced inflation on several of its raw materials including steel  plastic and wood 
transportation costs have also increased as fuel prices have increased 
the company has implemented price increases on its products in response to these increases and has been able to recover part of its increased costs 
however  the company has been unable to fully maintain its previous margins 
the company plans to continue to implement these price increases and is hopeful to regain its previous position with respect to margins  but can give no assurance that it will be successful in doing so 
the company estimates that the effects of inflation on its material costs has been to increase the costs of materials as a percent of sales by percentage points during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
at the current time  pricing of the company s raw materials has seemed generally to stabilize 
however  significant increases in the price of raw materials could reignite and have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company believes that compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not materially affected the company s operations
