revenues include sales to affiliates 
expenses increased in the period due to increased abandonment expense  exploration expense  production taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and lease operating expense 
questar e p results questar e p net income was million compared to million in  a increase 
higher profits were driven by increased production and higher realized natural gas  oil and ngl prices

production from rockies legacy properties was bcfe in compared to bcfe in  an increase 
legacy properties include all of questar e p s rocky mountain producing properties except pinedale and the uinta basin 
continued good performance from questar e p s hartshorne coalbed methane development project in the arkoma basin of eastern oklahoma and ongoing infill development drilling on the elm grove properties in northwest louisiana drove midcontinent results

hedging reduced oil revenues million during market resources may hedge up to of its forecasted production from proved developed reserves to lock in acceptable returns on invested capital and to protect cash flows and earnings from a decline in commodity prices 
market resources has continued to take advantage of higher natural gas and oil prices to add to its hedge positions in  and natural gas and oil hedges as of december   are summarized in item a of this report 
questar e p pre income tax cost structure is summarized in the following table 
year ended december  per mcfe lease operating expense production taxes lifting costs depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative expense allocated interest expense total lifting costs were per mcfe higher in versus due primarily to a increase in production taxes resulting from higher sales prices of natural gas  oil and ngl 
most production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of commodity sales prices 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased in compared to a year ago due to higher reserve replacement costs and ongoing depletion of older  lower cost successful efforts pools 
increased competition for rigs and other services in core operating areas  along with sharply higher steel prices  has increased drilling and completion costs 
general and administrative expenses increased per mcfe  or  in versus due primarily to higher labor and employee benefit costs and higher compliance costs 
allocated interest decreased about on a unit of production basis to per mcfe versus per mcfe in due primarily to increased production volumes 
lease operating expenses were lower in the period after the sale of higher cost canadian and other properties 
higher sales prices in compared with resulted in higher production taxes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization rates increased in over due to higher costs and  in part  lower estimated reserves in questar e p s uinta basin properties 
in impairments totaling million were recognized for bovina field in mississippi due to collapsed casing on one well  and the uneconomic coalbed methane play at the copper ridge unit in wyoming 
dry hole expense of million was recorded for the unsuccessful exploratory zones in the brady field 
pinedale anticline drilling activity during market resources drilled and completed wells  had four additional wells drilled to intermediate casing point and suspended until may  and had three wells waiting on completion at year end 
two of the wells waiting on completion were completed and turned to sales in january in addition  two rigs were actively drilling on the winter pad on december  in mid july  market resources commenced drilling a well to test the deep potential of its pinedale acreage 
the  foot stewart point well  designed to test the potential of the rock springs and blair formations beneath the lance pool pay zones at pinedale  was delayed over two months due to sage grouse activity 
the pace of drilling on the well was hampered by chronic mechanical problems with the contracted drilling rig and inexperienced rig crews 
in november  drilling operations were suspended at intermediate casing point at a depth of  feet and the rig was released 
a different rig will be used to finish drilling the well to total depth when operations resume in may pinedale anticline year round drilling proposal on april   market resources submitted a proposal to the blm seeking a long term exception to the winter drilling restrictions on its pinedale acreage from november through may on november   a blm decision gave market resources approval to phase in over the next year the company s proposed year round drilling program 
the blm decision allows market resources to operate two drilling rigs on one pad during the winter of after a proposed water and condensate gathering line is completed in  market resources will be allowed to operate six rigs from three active pads beginning in the winter of through the winter of market resources believes that year round drilling from pads is the most efficient and environmentally responsible approach for developing its pinedale acreage 
market resources year round drilling program will shorten the anticipated development drilling period from years to about years 
market resources can drill up to directional wells per single surface pad 
with year round drilling  surface disturbance will be reduced initially by about two thirds from almost  acres currently allowed to around acres 
surface disturbance would be further reduced to less than acres with post drilling reclamation 
other benefits of market resources year round drilling program include a substantial reduction in emissions  noise  dust and traffic compared to the current situation in which activities are compressed into the summer months 
year round drilling also creates year round jobs and thus a more stable  better trained  more productive and safer workforce in the drilling and completion service industries 
market resources has committed to build pipelines to transport condensate and water production off the portion of the pinedale anticline where market resources acreage is located 
the pipelines will eliminate the need for storage tanks at each location and up to  tanker truck trips per year at peak production 
other key components of the blm decision are funding for continued monitoring of mule deer and other critical wildlife  monitoring air quality  and habitat enhancement on contiguous undeveloped areas of market resources pinedale leasehold 
pinedale anticline acre spacing approved during the third quarter of  the wyoming oil and gas conservation commission issued a formal order approving acre density drilling of lance pool lance and mesaverde formation wells on all of market resources pinedale anticline acreage held at the end of approximately  acres 
with acre spacing market resources has up to total well locations on its pinedale leasehold including several recently acquired tracts that have not yet been approved for acre spacing with approximately locations remaining to be drilled at the end of market resources has over  gross acres under lease at pinedale 
questar e p and wexpro have a combined average working interest in the total development locations covering approximately  productive acres in the lance pool combined lance and mesaverde formations at pinedale 
of the gross lance pool development locations on market resources leasehold  questar e p has about net locations and wexpro has about market resources estimates that each acre spaced well drilled and completed in the lance and mesaverde formations will recover between and bcfe of gross incremental reserves 
questar e p s average working interest in horizons beneath the productive limits of the lance pool is approximately 
wexpro has no working interest in deeper horizons 
new pinedale leases during the third quarter of  questar e p acquired additional federal leases on  acres adjacent to the southwest side of the current  acre leasehold 
subject to approval of acre spacing  this newly acquired pinedale acreage may add up to drilling locations 
questar e p has a working interest in these new leases 
several groups have appealed the issuance of these leases 
wexpro wexpro net income increased to million in compared to million in wexpro manages  develops and produces gas reserves for affiliated company questar gas 
wexpro activities are governed by a long standing agreement wexpro agreement with the states of utah and wyoming 
pursuant to the wexpro agreement  wexpro recovers its costs and receives an unlevered after tax return of approximately on its net investment in commercial wells and related facilities known as the investment base adjusted for working capital  deferred taxes  and depreciation 
wexpro s net investment base increased to million at december   up million over wexpro s net income also benefited from higher oil and ngl prices in wexpro earned million in compared to million in due to increased investment in gas development wells  higher realized prices for oil  capitalized interest associated with construction  and lower debt expense 
wexpro s results included a million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change for asset retirement obligations 
gas gathering and processing net income from gas gathering and processing services increased to million in versus million in gathering margins increased by million due to an increase in volumes and a cent per mmbtu increase in gathering rates 
pinedale production and new projects serving third parties in the uinta basin are driving the expanded service 
gas management gas processing margins revenue from the sale of natural gas liquids less natural gas purchases and operating expenses improved by cents per gallon due to higher ngl sales prices 
to reduce processing margin volatility  gas management began hedging ngl prices in using forward sales contracts 
hedging reduced ngl revenues by million in net income from gas gathering and processing operations increased to million in compared to gathering volumes increased mmbtu to mmbtu in as the result of increased investment in gathering facilities in the pinedale area 
pre tax earnings from gas management s interest in rendezvous increased to million in from million for and million in rendezvous provides gas gathering services for the pinedale and jonah producing areas 
gas and oil marketing and trading  risk management and gas storage net income from energy trading was million in compared to a loss of million in the year earlier period 
gross margins for gas and oil marketing gross revenues less the costs to purchase gas and oil  commitments to gas transportation contracts on interstate pipelines  and gas storage costs  increased to million for versus million for current year results were positively impacted by higher unit margins and increased sales volumes 
gross margins declined in compared with due primarily to losses from long term transportation contracts that were above market rates for much of energy trading is the sole member in clear creek storage  llc  which owns and operates the clear creek natural gas storage facility in southwestern wyoming

questar pipeline did not increase transportation capacity during questar pipeline s existing transportation system is nearly fully subscribed 
as of december   questar pipeline had firm transportation contracts of  mdth per day compared with  mdth per day as of december   and  mdth per day as of december  the amounts include mdth per day capacity on the eastern segment of southern trails  which was placed in service in june questar pipeline s firm transportation contracts had a weighted average remaining life of years as of december  questar gas is questar pipeline s largest transportation customer with contracts for mdth per day  including mdth per day for winter peaking service 
the majority of questar gas s transportation contracts extend to questar pipeline s primary storage facility is clay basin in eastern utah 
this facility was contracted as of december  one contract expires in the first quarter of but is expected to be resold 
in addition to clay basin  questar pipeline also owns and operates three smaller aquifer gas storage facilities 
questar pipeline s firm storage contracts had a weighted average remaining life of years as of december  questar gas has contracted for of firm storage capacity at clay basin for terms extending from four to years  and of the firm storage capacity at the aquifer facilities for terms extending for years 
during the fourth quarter of  the ferc issued an order to questar pipeline in a case involving the annual fuel gas reimbursement percentage fgrp 
as a result questar pipeline recorded a revenue reduction in of million  which included million for prior years  as a potential credit to customers 
the ferc previously granted questar pipeline s request to increase the fgrp effective january  in its order  the ferc approved the fgrp but also ruled that questar pipeline is required to credit to transmission customers proceeds from the sale of natural gas liquids recovered from its hydrocarbon dew point facilities at the kastler plant in northeastern utah 
questar pipeline has filed a request for rehearing with the ferc 
questar pipeline believes that any credit to customers should be reduced by the plant s cost of service 
until the issue is resolved  questar pipeline will continue to accrue a potential liability equal to any liquid revenues from the dew point plant 
questar pipeline charges ferc approved transportation and storage rates that are based on straight fixed variable rate design 
under this rate design all fixed costs of providing service  including depreciation and return on investment  are recovered through a fixed reservation charge per unit of contracted transportation capacity  or a demand charge 
about of questar pipeline costs are fixed and recovered through these demand charges 
questar pipeline s earnings are driven primarily by demand revenues from firm shippers 
operating costs that vary based on throughput are recovered through volumetric charges 
since demand charges are based on contract levels and volumetric charges are about of the total customer charge  period to period changes in firm transportation volumes do not have a significant impact on earnings 
questar transportation services  a subsidiary of questar pipeline  owns nonjurisdictional gathering lines and a processing plant near price  utah 
transportation services built the plant in for questar gas to remove carbon dioxide from gas prior to delivery to questar pipeline 
questar gas has contracted for of the plant s firm capacity and pays the cost of service for operating the plant 
expenses operating and maintenance expenses increased in compared with and in compared with the increases were primarily due to higher employee benefit costs  and higher costs associated with maintenance and continued marketing of the western segment of the southern trails pipeline 
operating and maintenance expenses per dth transported were in compared with in and in depreciation expense increased in over and in over  reflecting increased pipeline investment 
clay basin storage questar pipeline continues to investigate a potential discrepancy of up to bcf between the book volumes of cushion gas at clay basin and cushion gas volumes implied by pressure survey data obtained in recent field tests 
the current book volume of the cushion gas is bcf with a value of million 
questar pipeline has not determined if any gas is missing from the reservoir 
analysis to date has not revealed any leaks or gas migration out of the reservoir 
additional reservoir tests and analysis  including reservoir modeling  are under way to identify the cause of the potential discrepancy and may continue for several years 
the gas may still be in the reservoir but not detectible with short duration pressure surveys 
pressure survey tests were conducted during october to evaluate the reservoir when it was nearly full 
the preliminary results of these tests show that the discrepancy may not be significant 
this potential discrepancy has not affected questar pipeline s ability to meet its obligations to storage customers 
if questar pipeline determines that the discrepancy is due to changes in the physical conditions in the storage reservoir  the financial impact may include some additional investment in cushion gas to meet service obligations 
if the discrepancy is due to lost and unaccounted for gas in the measurement process  questar pipeline would expense the cost of replacement gas and could file with the ferc to recover costs from customers 
new long term contracts during first quarter questar pipeline signed long term contracts to support a million expansion of its central utah transmission system 
the expansion will add mdth per day of capacity from the piceance and uinta basins to the kern river pipeline  a power generation facility  and questar gas s distribution system 
questar pipeline will start construction in the summer of for a late in service date 
on january   the ferc approved the expansion 
questar pipeline has signed a long term contract supporting a million extension from the west end of its mainline near goshen  utah  to a new power plant near mona  utah 
construction was completed in december on this mdth per day line and service should begin during the first quarter of southern trails the eastern segment of the southern trails line  which runs between the san juan basin and the california border  was placed into service in mid capacity on this segment is fully contracted  although these contracts expire in mid at this time  market transportation rates between the receipt and delivery points are less than current contract rates 
earnings on the eastern segment may decrease when these contracts expire 
the western segment of the southern trails line  which runs from the california arizona border to long beach  california  is currently not in service 
questar pipeline s investment is approximately million 
additional investment would be required to complete the conversion of the pipeline from a liquid pipeline to a natural gas pipeline and make connections to customers 
the los angeles department of water and power ladwp budgeted funds to acquire a gas pipeline to serve a power generation facility and issued a request for proposal on october  questar pipeline filed a response to the request in november on february   ladwp notified questar pipeline of its intent to pursue the proposal  although it is uncertain whether negotiations will be successful 
regulation ferc order no 
 which defines standards of conduct for transmission providers  became effective on september  these standards of conduct are designed to ensure that employees engaged in transmission system operations function independently from employees of marketing and energy affiliates 
in addition  a transmission provider must treat all transmission customers on a non discriminatory basis and must not operate its transmission system to preferentially benefit its marketing or energy affiliates 
questar pipeline has determined that all market resources subsidiaries except gas management are marketing or energy affiliates 
questar gas is not an energy or marketing affiliate 
questar pipeline and other questar companies have adopted new procedures to comply with this order 
questar pipeline is required to comply with the pipeline safety improvement act of this act and the rules issued by the department of transportation dot require interstate pipelines and local distribution companies to implement a year program of risk analysis  pipeline assessment and remedial repair for transmission pipelines located in high consequence areas such as densely populated locations 
questar pipeline s plan for complying with the act was filed with the dot during questar pipeline estimates that its annual cost to comply with the act will be approximately million  not including costs of pipeline replacement  if necessary 
questar pipeline made an annual fgrp filing with the ferc on november   requesting an increase in the fgrp to

the pscu based the increase on november rate base  operating costs and usage per customer 
at december   questar gas was serving  customers 
customer growth remained above industry averages at over the prior year 
housing construction in utah remained strong 
usage per customer  adjusted for normal temperatures  declined in compared with after increasing in compared with usage per customer has been decreasing due to more efficient appliances and construction and customer response to higher prices 
weather  as measured in heating degree days for the questar gas service area  was colder than normal in  warmer than normal in and colder than normal in a weather normalization adjustment on customer bills generally offsets financial impacts of moderate temperature variations 
however  significantly warmer than normal weather during september and october resulted in a margin reduction of million 
questar gas s results included million in recovery of previously denied gas processing costs 
these costs are part of a continuing dispute as discussed below 
the results also included revenues of million due to up front customer contributions in aid of construction for new connections 
accounting for customer contributions changed beginning in as a result of the utah general rate case 
customer contributions are now recorded as a reduction of investment instead of revenues 
industrial deliveries declined in versus and in versus due primarily to lower usage of gas for power generation 
operating expense cost of natural gas sold increased in the versus and in versus the year earlier period 
the change was due to increased volumes and higher natural gas purchase costs 
the increase over was due to higher cost of purchased natural gas 
questar gas accounts for purchased gas costs in accordance with procedures authorized by the pscu and the pscw 
purchased gas costs that are different from those provided for in present rates are accumulated and recovered or credited through future rate changes 
as of december   questar gas had a million balance in the purchased gas adjustment account representing gas costs incurred but not yet recovered from customers 
effective october   the pscu and pscw authorized questar gas to increase customer rates by about to reflect higher projected gas costs and to recover the balance in the purchased gas adjustment account 
operating and maintenance expenses increased in compared with  after decreasing in compared with higher employee benefit costs  contracted services and bad debt costs in were partially offset by lower information technology costs 
the decrease was due to lower information technology and bad debt expenses 
depreciation expense increased in compared with and in compared with plant additions  including a customer information system that was placed in service in july  have increased depreciation expense 
in july  questar gas implemented a new customer information system 
the new system provides critical customer service functions including billing  collections  cash receipts  customer sign up  service requests and dispatch 
the implementation took approximately months and cost approximately million 
rate refund obligation on august   the utah supreme court issued an order reversing an august decision made by the pscu concerning certain natural gas processing costs incurred by questar gas 
the court ruled that the pscu did not comply with its statutory responsibilities and regulatory procedures when approving a stipulation in questar gas s general rate case 
the stipulation permitted questar gas to collect million per year  a portion of the processing costs  through may the committee of consumer services  a utah state agency  appealed the pscu s decision  arguing that the pscu had failed to explicitly address whether the costs were prudent 
as a result of the court s order  questar gas recorded a liability for a potential refund to gas distribution customers 
a total liability of million  including million recorded in the first nine months of  includes revenue received for processing costs and interest from june through september on august   the pscu ruled that questar gas failed in to prove that its decision to contract for gas processing with an affiliate was prudent 
the pscu rejected the stipulation  denied the request for rate recovery and ordered the refund of gas processing costs previously collected in rates 
because questar gas had previously accrued a liability for the refund  the order did not have a material impact on earnings 
questar gas reduced its rates on september   to eliminate the collection of gas processing costs and on october began refunding previously collected costs  plus interest  over a month period 
as of december   questar gas had a liability of million of remaining refunds to customers 
in response to a questar gas petition  the pscu clarified that its order did not preclude recovery of ongoing and certain past processing costs 
ongoing processing costs are approximately million per year 
questar gas has requested ongoing rate coverage for gas processing costs in its pass through filings  but is not currently collecting these costs in rates 
the pscu has conducted several technical conferences to determine what should be done to manage the heat content of the gas supply 
on january   questar gas filed a rate request with the pscu to recover million per year of gas processing costs through its gas balance account 
regulation questar gas is subject to the requirements of the pipeline safety improvement act 
questar gas estimates that it will cost to million per year to comply with the act  not including costs of pipeline replacement if necessary 
the pscu has allowed questar gas to record incremental operating costs to comply with this act as a regulatory asset until the next rate case or three years  whichever is sooner

the company typically has negative net working capital at december because of short term borrowing 
the borrowing is seasonal and generally peaks at the end of the year because of the lag in receivables related to cold weather gas purchases for distribution customers 
contractual cash obligations and other commitments in the course of ordinary business activities  questar enters into a variety of contractual cash obligations and other commitments 
the following table summarizes the significant contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by year total after in millions long term debt gas purchase contracts transportation contracts operating leases total  critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions questar s significant accounting policies are described in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management 
successful efforts accounting for gas and oil operations the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions  exploration  development and production activities 
under this method  the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties  successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed 
costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred 
the capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties 
individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment 
capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned 
capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves 
the calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement  surface restoration and property abandonment costs  net of estimated equipment salvage values 
other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants 
a gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned  or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected 
questar e p engages independent reservoir engineering consultants to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves 
reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available 
long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis 
if the undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the net book value of the asset group  the asset value is written down to estimated fair value which is determined using discounted future net revenues 
accounting for derivatives the company uses derivative instruments  typically fixed price swaps  to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production 
accounting rules for derivatives require that these instruments be marked to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date 
the change in fair value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives 
the company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in sfas as amended 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced 
when a derivative is terminated before its contract expires  the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered 
questar e p uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas  oil and ngl sold to purchasers 
revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity index prices and volumes supplied by field operators 
a liability is recorded to the extent that questar e p has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property 
energy trading revenues are presented on a gross revenue basis 
questar gas estimates revenues on a calendar basis even though bills are sent to customers on a cycle basis throughout the month 
the company estimates unbilled revenues for the period from the date meters are read to the end of the month  using usage history and weather information 
approximately one half month of revenues is estimated in any period 
the gas costs and other variable costs are recorded on the same basis to ensure proper matching of revenues and expenses 
questar gas s tariff provides for monthly adjustments to customer charges to approximate the impact of normal temperatures on nongas revenues 
questar gas estimates the weather normalization adjustment for the unbilled revenue each month 
the weather normalization adjustment is evaluated each month and reconciled on an annual basis in the summer to agree with the amount billed to customers 
rate regulation regulatory agencies establish rates for the storage  transportation  distribution and sale of natural gas 
the regulatory agencies also regulate  among other things  the extension and enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional natural gas facilities 
regulation is intended to permit the recovery  through rates  of the cost of service  including a return on investment 
questar gas and questar pipeline follow sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  that requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities by companies subject to cost based regulation 
the ferc  pscu and pscw have accepted the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities 
employee benefit plans the company has pension and post retirement benefit plans covering a majority of its employees 
the calculation of the company s expense and liability associated with its benefit plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expenses and liabilities and actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
independent consultants hired by the company use actuarial models to calculate the yearly expenses of pension and post retirement benefits 
the models consider mortality estimations  liability discount rates  long term rate of return on investments  rate of increase of compensation  amortizing gain or loss from investments and medical cost trend rates among the key factors 
management makes assumptions based on parameters and advice from the consultants 
the company believes that the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are critical assumptions 
the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
management considered the rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments and compared those results with a bond defeasance technique 
the company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of and as of december   and  respectively 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the company s annual expense by million 
the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year giving consideration to the pension plan s investment mix and the historical and forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company as of january   and  was 
pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return causes a million increase in the annual pension expense

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk questar s primary market risk exposures arise from commodity price changes for natural gas  oil and ngl  estimation of gas and oil reserves and volatility in interest rates 
energy trading has long term contracts for pipeline capacity and is obligated for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments 
commodity price risk management market resources bears the risk associated with commodity price changes and uses gas and oil price hedging arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of adverse price movements 
however these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements 
hedging contracts are used for a significant share of questar e p owned gas and oil production and for a portion of gas and oil marketing transactions and for some of gas management s ngl 
market resources has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives 
natural gas and oil price hedging supports market resources rate of return and cash flow targets and protects earnings from downward movements in commodity prices 
the volume of hedged production and the mix of derivative instruments are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions and reviewed periodically by the finance and audit committee of the board of directors 
market resources may hedge up to of forecast nonregulated production from proved developed reserves when prices meet earnings and cash flow objectives 
proved developed production represents production from existing wells 
market resources does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes and does not hedge undeveloped reserves or equity ngl 
hedges are matched to equity gas and oil production  thus qualifying as cash flow hedges under the accounting provisions of sfas as amended and interpreted 
gas hedges are typically structured as fixed price swaps into regional pipelines  locking in basis and hedge effectiveness 
any ineffective portion of hedges is immediately recognized in the income statement 
the ineffective portion of hedges was not significant in and as of december   approximately bcf of forecast full year gas production was hedged at an average price of per mcf  net to the well 
market resources enters into commodity price hedging arrangements with several banks and energy trading firms 
generally the contracts allow some amount of credit before market resources is required to deposit collateral for out of the money hedges 
in some contracts the amount of credit varies depending on the credit rating assigned to market resources debt 
market resources current ratings support individual counterparty lines of credit of million to million 
if market resources credit ratings fall below investment grade bbb by standard poor s or baa by moody s  counterparty credit generally falls to zero 
in addition to the counterparty arrangements  market resources has a million revolving credit facility in place with banks 
a summary of market resources hedging positions for equity production as of december   is shown below 
prices are net to the well 
currently all hedges are fixed price swaps with creditworthy counterparties  allowing market resources to achieve a known price for a specific volume of production delivered into a regional sales point 
the swap price is then reduced by gathering costs and adjusted for product quality to determine the net to the well price
