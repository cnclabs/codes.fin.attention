industry background the conversion of analog to digital technology is creating a revolution in audio and video consumer electronics 
digital technology continues to improve the consumer entertainment experience with such products as large screen televisions  multi featured dvd players  home theater systems  navigational systems  digital still cameras  camera enabled cellular phones  and digital camcorders 
technology advancements have enhanced the clarity  color  sound  functionality and convenience of consumer entertainment products 
in particular  the transition from analog to digital formats has allowed audio and video data to be compressed with little or no perceptible audio and image degradation  improving storage and transmission efficiency 
digital formats provide users with several benefits  including greatly expanded content selection  accelerated transmission of video and audio content  random access to data  superior editing capabilities and enhanced security features such as protection against unauthorized copying 
the television  the telephone and the personal computer pc have emerged as the three principal systems that manage digital entertainment and information 
the television and the pc are the principal devices for viewing and manipulating digital content 
digital set top boxes  dvd players and game consoles connected to televisions are emerging as the principal platforms for viewing and listening to entertainment  
table of contents while pcs remain the principle platform for storing  and manipulating data and accessing the internet 
the cellular phone is emerging as the principal mobile device for viewing and transmitting digital content 
however  because of size limitations for screens and keypads other mobile devices such as pdas  mpeg audio players mps  and portable dvd players also enjoy sizable end markets 
increasing advances in semiconductor technology are allowing digital products to converge  resulting in cost savings and added convenience for consumers 
at the same time  advances in communication allow better distribution of information and entertainment content and provide opportunities for further development of multimedia products 
as digital processing and transmission technology improves  we believe additional entertainment products will continue to be introduced 
some of the more significant digital entertainment products available today include dvd players 
dvd players provide significantly higher quality playback than is possible with vcr or vcd technology through the use of motion picture experts group mpeg and mpeg video decoding and high quality digital audio technologies 
video cd vcd players 
vcd players are music cd players that have been modified to display video on a television and typically sell for less than a low end vcr 
vcd offers quality comparable to vcr  but is limited to approximately minutes of video information  using an mpeg format standard for compression 
the vcd market is divided into the standard vcd market  and the subsequently developed super vcd svcd market 
vcd is popular in many developing countries while svcd is almost exclusively sold in china 
digital set top boxes stbs 
digital stbs enable subscriber based television through cable  terrestrial broadcast  digital subscriber line  or dsl  and satellite transmissions 
digital video recorders dvrs 
dvrs provide local hard disk memory storage and enable storage and playback of live video streams on a real time basis 
dvrs can be in the form of standalone players or be incorporated into digital stbs to enhance their functionality 
recordable dvd players 
recordable dvd players add high quality video and audio recording capabilities to the dvd disc through the addition of a writable optical drive 
consumer digital audio players 
consumer digital audio players include multi channel surround sound products with movie theater quality sound systems 
our chips incorporate this digital audio processor as components of a home entertainment system 
digital amplifiers 
consumer video and audio players require an amplifier to boost the sound signal to drive loudspeakers in automobiles  homes and mobile devices 
our chips convert the digital sound into pulse width modulation pwm digital pulses enabling them to be directly and digitally amplified without sacrificing sound quality while drastically reducing size and power requirements 
our digital amplifier chips interface directly with digital audio sources such as dvd and cd players  surround sound systems  audio receivers  boom boxes and televisions sets 
camera enabled cellular phones 
camera enabled cellular phones use a lens module made up of a lens  cmos image sensor  housing and flex cable to enable cellular phones to have image capture and processor capabilities and display those images on the cell phone display or transmit them to someone else 
camera enabled cell phones may use either a stand alone image processor chip or a broadband processor chip to process the image

no other end customers accounted for more than of our net revenues during and information on net sales from external customers and long lived assets attributable to our geographic regions is included in note  business segment information and concentration of certain risks  to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
sales and distribution we market our products worldwide through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
we have sales and support offices in the united states  china  hong kong  taiwan  japan and korea 
we believe customer service and technical support are important competitive factors in selling to major customers 
sales representatives and distributors supplement our efforts by providing additional customer service at the local level 
we believe close contact with our customers not only improves the customer s level of satisfaction  but also provides important insight into future market direction 
international sales comprised approximately of our net revenues in  and international sales are based upon destination of the shipment 
our international sales in  and were derived primarily from asian customers who manufacture dvd  vcd  cameras  cell phones  communications and pc audio products 
companies in asia manufacture a large percentage of the worldwide supply of these products 
we believe a significant portion of our chip products are incorporated into consumer electronic devices that are ultimately sold into the united states 
we have direct sales personnel and technical staff located in hong kong  taiwan  china  korea and japan where significant portions of our sales have historically been derived 
our products are also sold internationally through distributors and sales representatives located in hong kong  korea  japan and singapore 
for fiscal year  net sales to customers including distributors in each region as a percentage of our total net sales were hong kong  taiwan  japan  china  korea  turkey  and singapore 
all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
our business is usually seasonal due to the christmas holiday season in america and europe  and the chinese new year season in china and asia 
our sales representatives and distributors are not subject to minimum purchase requirements and can discontinue marketing any of our products at any time 
in addition  certain of our distributors have rights of return for unsold product and rights to pricing allowances to compensate for rapid  unexpected price changes 
we rely on our largest distributor  dynax electronics hk dynax electronics  for a significant portion of our revenues 
sales through dynax electronics were approximately  and of our net revenues in  and  respectively 
dynax electronics is not subject to any minimum purchase requirements and can discontinue marketing any of our products at any time 
in addition  dynax electronics has rights of return for unsold product and rights to pricing allowances to compensate for rapid  unexpected price changes  therefore we do not recognize revenue until dynax electronics sells through to our end customers 

table of contents manufacturing we contract with third parties for all of our fabrication and assembly as well as the majority of our test operations 
this manufacturing strategy enables us to focus on our design and development strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing capabilities 
semiconductor manufacturing consists of foundry activity where wafer fabrication takes place  as well as chip assembly and testing activities 
we use several independent foundries that use advanced manufacturing technologies to fabricate our chips 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  which has manufactured products for us since  united microelectronics corporation umc  which is also located in taiwan  and other independent asian foundries 
most of our products are currently fabricated using both mixed signal and logic cmos to micron process technologies 
manufacturing requires raw materials and a variety of components to be manufactured to our specifications 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers to obtain adequate supplies of quality raw materials on a timely basis 
we do not generally have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers  and we depend on foundries such as tsmc  umc and others for foundry capacity to produce products of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yields in a timely manner 
as of december   we believe we have sufficient foundry capacity to meet our forecasted needs for the next months 
after wafer fabrication by the foundry  all of our semiconductor products and lens modules are assembled and tested by third party vendors  primarily advanced semiconductor engineering and amkor technology 
we have internally designed and developed our own test software and purchased certain test equipment  which are provided to our test vendors 
see item  factors that may affect future results our products are manufactured by independent third parties 
competition our markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  price reductions and rapid product obsolescence 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  where the customer evaluates alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits 
because of shortened product life cycles  there are frequent design win competitions for next generation systems 
we expect competition to remain intense from existing competitors and from companies that may enter our existing or future markets 
in general  product prices in the semiconductor industry have decreased over the life of a particular product 
the markets for our products are characterized by intense price competition 
as the markets for our products mature and competition increases  we anticipate that prices for our products will continue to rapidly decline 
our existing and potential competitors consist of medium and large domestic and international companies  many of whom have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater intellectual property rights  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
our competitors also include a number of smaller and emerging companies 
our principal competitors in the dvd market include mediatek incorporation mediatek  zoran  sony  panasonic  stmicroelectronic  lsi logic  sunplus and cirrus logic 
in addition  we expect that the dvd platform will face competition from other platforms including stbs  as well as multi function game boxes 
some of our competitors may supply chips for multiple platforms  such as lsi logic and stmicroelectronics  each of which makes chips for both dvd players and stbs 
we also face strong competition from sunplus  a competitor in the vcd and dvd market 
our competitors in the digital imaging market include omnivision  as well as other emerging companies 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories as well as greater name recognition than we have 
any of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 

table of contents in addition  as the market for the digital home system develops  a number of companies with significantly greater resources than us could attempt to increase their presence in the market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors resulting in increased competition to us 
in the past years  lsi logic acquired c cube microsystems  cirrus logic acquired luxsonor semiconductors  oak technology acquired teralogic  and zoran acquired oak technology 
proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
as of december   we had patents granted in the us  and at least applications on file with the united states patent and trademark office uspto 
in addition  as of december  we had approximately corresponding foreign patents granted and applications pending 
we intend to seek further us and international patents on our technology whenever possible 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
as of december   there was one intellectual property litigation matter pending against us which we are vigorously defending and believe will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
see item  legal proceedings 
we currently license certain of the technology we use in our products  and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
we have  in the past  granted limited licenses to certain of our technology  some of which have expired 
see item  factors that may affect future results we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use and we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
backlog our products are generally sold pursuant to standard purchase orders  which are often issued only days in advance of shipment and are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customers requirements 
product deliveries are scheduled when we receive purchase orders 
generally  these purchase orders allow customers to reschedule delivery dates and cancel purchase orders without significant penalties 
for these reasons  we believe that our backlog  while useful for scheduling production  is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 
delays in delivery schedules and or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as of december   our backlog amounted to approximately million 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including in research and development  in marketing  sales and support  in finance and administration and in manufacturing 
over of our employees are engineers  and a significant number of them are software engineers 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel  particularly highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software engineers involved in new product development  for whom competition can be intense  particularly in the silicon valley 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good

executive overview we design  develop and market highly integrated analog and digital processor chips  imaging sensor chips  digital amplifiers  and camera lens modules 
our digital processor chips are the primary processors driving digital video and audio devices  including dvd  video cd vcd  consumer digital audio players  and digital media players 
our imaging sensor chips utilize advanced complimentary metal oxide semiconductor cmos sensor technology to capture an image for cellular camera phone applications 
our digital amplifiers boost the digital sound to a level required to drive loudspeakers  in such applications as dvd and cd players  home theater systems  audio receivers  boom boxes and television sets 
our camera lens modules provide camera capabilities to electronic devices such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants pdas 
we have also developed and marketed encoding processors to address the growing demand for digital video recorders dvrs and recordable dvd players 
we believe that multi featured dvd  dvr and recordable dvd players will serve as a platform for the digital home system dhs  integrating various digital home entertainment and information delivery products into a single box 
we are also a supplier of chips for use in modems  other communication devices  and pc audio products 
our chips use multiple processors and a programmable architecture that enable us to offer a broad array of features and functionality 

table of contents we focus on our design and development strengths and outsource all of our chip fabrication and assembly as well as the majority of our test operations 
we market our products worldwide through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
substantially all of our sales are to customers in china  hong kong  taiwan  japan  korea  turkey and singapore 
we employ sales and support personnel located outside of the united states in china  taiwan  hong kong  korea and japan to support these international sales efforts 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues 
in addition  substantially all of our products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
we also have a number of employees engaged in research and development efforts outside of the united states 
there are special risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states 
see item  factors that may affect future results we have significant international sales and operations that are subject to the special risks of doing business outside the united states

see note  significant business combinations  to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended december  were impacted by the fact that demand for digital media products continued to be slower in the fourth quarter of than expected 
consequently  we booked additional excess and obsolete reserves of million and additional lower of cost or market inventory reserves of million in the fourth quarter 
the discussion in this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition inventories and inventory reserves goodwill and other intangible assets impairment of long lived assets income taxes legal contingencies in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also cases in which management s judgment is required in selecting appropriate accounting treatment among available alternatives under gaap 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit 
table of contents committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition except for sales to distributors  revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time of shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for products sold to certain distributors with certain rights of return and allowances  revenue is deferred until the distributor resells the products to a third party 
we provide for rebates based on current contractual terms and future returns based on historical experiences at the time revenue is recognized as reductions to product revenue 
actual amounts may be different from management s estimates 
such differences  if any  are recorded in the period they become known 
income from mediatek royalties for the sale of products utilizing licensed technology is reported as revenue based on the number of units sold as reported to us by mediatek 
inventories and inventory reserves our inventory is comprised of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  all of which are manufactured by third party contractors 
inventory is valued at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated slow moving  excess  obsolete  damaged or otherwise unmarketable products by an amount that is the difference between cost and estimated market value based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
we evaluate excess or obsolete inventory primarily by estimating demand for individual products within specific time horizons  typically one year or less 
we generally provide a reserve for the cost of products with on hand and committed quantities in excess of the estimated demand after considering factors such as product life cycles 
once established  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory are only released when the reserved products are scrapped or sold 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory at the lower of standard cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are based on the difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is the forecasted selling price of the product less the estimated costs of completion and disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value 
the estimates of future demand  forecasted sales prices and market conditions used in the valuation of inventory form the basis for our published and internal revenue forecast 
if actual results are substantially lower than the forecast  we may be required to record additional write downs of product inventory in future periods and this may have a negative impact on gross margins 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 

table of contents significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
the impairment evaluation of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
if we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
we completed the annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of and found no impairment 
our impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value 
unless there are indicators of impairment  our next impairment review will be completed in the fourth quarter of if our revenue and cost forecasts are not achieved  we may incur charges for goodwill impairment  which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our net equity and results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of timing differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
us deferred income taxes are not provided on un remitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered permanently invested 
assumptions underlying recognition of deferred tax assets and non recognition of us income tax on un remitted earnings can change if our business plan is not achieved or if congress adopts changes in the internal revenue code of  as amended 
legal contingencies from time to time  we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of patents  trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising out of the ordinary course of business 
further  we are currently engaged in certain shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits 
these contingencies require management judgment in order to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach

the new standard indicates that abnormal freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be treated as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory cost 
additionally  the standard clarifies that fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of a production facility

as such  we are not yet in a position to decide on whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments  as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired

although asp generally increased in as compared to the preceding year  in the third quarter of  we began experiencing increased competition and pricing pressures for both our dvd and vcd products resulting in an adverse effect on our margins in the second half of the year

unit sales decreased by and asp per unit decreased by 
we believe this decrease resulted from the entry in the third quarter of of mediatek  who introduced to the marketplace a dvd chip that we believed infringed our intellectual property rights 
we filed a lawsuit in the united states against mediatek requesting both damages and an injunction to stop the importation into the united states of dvd players containing products we believe infringed our intellectual property rights 
on june   we entered into the settlement agreement with mediatek relating to this lawsuit 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  both sides terminated all claims against each other and mediatek received a non exclusive worldwide license of our proprietary dvd user interface and other key dvd software 
we sold approximately million units of our dvd chip products in as compared to approximately million units in vcd revenues were million in  a decrease of million  or  from to  primarily due to lower asp per unit 
asp per unit decreased by while unit sales increased by 
the changes were primarily due to the change in the product mix of the vcd group from to beginning in  the vcd chipsets were being phased out and replaced by visba integrated chips 
as a result  unit sales of the visba increased significantly while the unit sales of the vcd chipsets declined 
however  asp per unit of the visba was lower than the asp per unit of the vcd chipsets 
therefore  the overall asp per unit dropped

to date  we have not declared or paid cash dividends to our shareholders and do not anticipate paying any dividend in the foreseeable future due to a number of factors  including the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential requirement to finance working capital in the event of a significant upturn in business 
we reevaluate this practice from time to time but are not currently contemplating the payment of a cash dividend 
we have no long term debt 
our capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be approximately million 
we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary business or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of  or investment in  such businesses  products or technologies owned by third parties 
also  from time to time the board of directors may approve the expenditure of cash resources to repurchase our common stock as market conditions warrant 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash and short term investments as of december   together with funds expected to be generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  strategic investment requirements  acquisitions of property and equipment  stock repurchases and other potential needs for the next twelve months

additionally  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners  principally for service  license and other operating supplies 
as of december   commitments under these arrangements totaled million 
there are no material commitments for these arrangements extending beyond from time to time  we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising out of the ordinary course of business

either of these results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see part i  item  legal proceedings 
factors that may affect future results we operate in highly competitive markets 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological changes  price reductions and short product life cycles 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  when customers evaluate alternative design approaches requiring integrated circuits 
because of short product life cycles  there are frequent design win competitions for next generation systems 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with products that may be provided at lower costs or provide higher levels of integration  higher performance or additional features 
in some cases  our competitors have been acquired by even larger organizations  giving them access to even greater resources with which to compete with us 
advancements in technology can change the competitive environment in ways that may be adverse to us 
for example  today s high performance central processing units in pcs have enough excess computing capacity to perform many of the functions that formerly required a separate chip set  which has reduced demand for our pc audio chips 
the announcements and commercial shipments of competitive products could adversely affect sales of our products and may result in increased price competition that would adversely affect the asp and margins of our products 

table of contents the following factors may affect our ability to compete in our highly competitive markets the timing and success of our new product introductions and those of our customers and competitors  the timely shipment of our vibratto ii chip with our own servo ip in it  the timely shipment of a recordable servo product  the timely shipment of our new vcd chip  the timely shipment of our new megapixel sensor chip  the timely shipment of our new univga and new uni megapixel products  the timely shipment of our new vibratto ii cl and vibratto iii products  the price  quality and performance of our products and the products of our competitors  the emergence of new multimedia standards  the development of technical innovations  the ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity and sources of raw materials  the rate at which our customers integrate our products into their products  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and the protection of our intellectual property rights 
our business is highly dependent on the expansion of the consumer electronics market 
our primary focus has been developing products primarily for the consumer electronics market 
currently  our sales of video system processor chips to the dvd and vcd including vcd and svcd player markets account for a majority of our revenues 
we expect these products will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
given the current economic environment  consumer spending on dvd players and cellular camera phones may not increase as expected or may even weaken or fall 
consequently  we continue to invest in new product lines for the consumer electronics market 
nonetheless  our strategy in these new markets may not be successful 
if the markets for these products and applications decline or fail to develop as expected  or if we are not successful in our efforts to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate our chip into their products 
it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations 
in addition  the potential decline in consumer confidence and consumer spending that may be occasioned by natural disasters  epidemics  terrorist attacks or armed conflict could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations that may cause volatility or a decline in the price of our stock 
historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly 
our future quarterly operating results will likely fluctuate from time to time and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in a particular future period 
the price of our common stock could decline due to such fluctuations 
the following factors may cause significant fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results charges related to the net realizable value of inventories and or excess inventories  changes in demand for our products  changes in the mix of products sold and our revenue mix  increasing pricing pressures and resulting reduction in the asp of any or all of our products  gain or loss of significant customers  
table of contents seasonal customer demand  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the timing of our and our competitors new product announcements and introductions and the market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our and our customers products  the timing of significant customer orders  loss of key employees which could impact sales or the pace of product development  the turns basis of most of our orders  which makes backlog a poor indicator of the next quarter s revenue  the lead time we normally receive for our orders  which makes it difficult to predict sales until the end of the quarter  availability and cost of raw materials  significant increases in expenses associated with the expansion of operations  availability and cost of foundry capacity  and a shift in manufacturing of consumer electronic products away from china 
we often purchase inventories based on sales forecasts and if anticipated sales do not materialize  we may continue to experience significant inventory charges 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase our products from independent foundries and other vendors on an approximately three month rolling basis  while our customers generally place purchase orders frequently with short lead times with us that may be cancelled without significant penalty 
some of these customers may require us to demonstrate our ability to deliver in response to their short lead time 
in order to accommodate such customers  we have to commit to certain inventories before we have a firm commitment from our customers 
if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are cancelled or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and we may be required to record significant inventory charges in our statement of operations in a particular period 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we reduce the carrying value of our inventories for estimated slow moving  excess  obsolete  damaged or otherwise unmarketable products by an amount that is the difference between cost and estimated market value based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
as our business grows  we may increasingly rely on distributors  which may further impede our ability to accurately forecast product orders 
additionally  we may venture into new products with different supply chain and logistics requirements which may in turn cause excess or shortage of inventory 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net inventory provision of million and we may continue to experience these charges in future periods 
we may need to acquire other companies or technologies to successfully compete in our industry and we may not be successful acquiring key targets or integrating our acquisitions into our business 
we will continue to regularly consider the acquisition of other companies or the products and technologies of other companies to complement our existing product offerings  improve our market coverage and enhance our technological capabilities 
there may be technologies that we need to acquire or license in order to remain competitive 
however  we may not be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisitions and investments or be able to acquire them at costs that are competitive 
acquisitions and investments carry risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including the failure of the acquired products or technology to attain market acceptance  which may result from our inability to leverage such products and technology successfully  the failure to integrate acquired products and business with existing products and corporate culture  
table of contents the inability to retain key employees from the acquired company  diversion of management attention from other business concerns  the potential for large write offs  issuances of equity securities dilutive to our existing shareholders  the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities  and our ability to properly access and maintain an effective internal control environment over an acquired company in order to comply with the recently adopted and pending public reporting requirements 
our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of purchase accounting treatment and the impact of amortization and impairment of intangible assets relating to business combinations 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we accounted for our acquisitions of divio and pictos using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  we have allocated the cost of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable intangible assets such as existing and core technology and customer and distributor relationships and in process research and development  based on their respective fair values at the date of the completion of the business combinations 
intangible assets are required to be amortized prospectively over their estimated useful lives 
any excess of the purchase price over those fair market values will be accounted for as goodwill 
we are not required to amortize goodwill against income but will be subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
if we are required to recognize impairment charges  the charges will negatively impact reported earnings in the period of the charges 
our research and development investments may fail to enhance our competitive position 
we invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development activities to maintain and enhance our competitive position 
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and the commitment of extensive engineering resources 
we incur substantial research and development costs to confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product that in the end may not be successful 
if we are not able to successfully complete our research and development projects on a timely basis  we may face competitive disadvantages 
there is no assurance that we will recover the development costs associated with these projects or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development efforts 
some of our significant projects include the development of a next generation dvd chip that will incorporate our servo technology and a recordable product that will incorporate our encoder technology 
this will require a new architecture and a complete system on a chip design  which is extremely complex and may not ultimately be feasible 
if we are unable to successfully develop this next generation dvd processor chip  or complete other significant research and development projects  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our sales may fluctuate due to seasonality and changes in customer demand 
since we are primarily focused on the consumer electronics market  we are likely to be affected both by changes in consumer demand and by seasonality in the sales of our products 
historically  over half of consumer electronic products are sold during the holiday seasons 
consumer electronic product sales have historically been much higher during the holiday shopping seasons than during other times of the year  although the manufacturers shipments vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including retail levels and retail promotional activities 
in addition  consumer demand often varies from one product to another in consecutive holiday seasons and is strongly influenced by the overall state of the economy 
because the consumer electronic market experiences substantial seasonal fluctuations  seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly and our inability to forecast these trends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
for instance  in the future  as asps for 
table of contents dvd products decline  customer demands for vcd products may shift to dvd products and ultimately render our vcd products  from which we enjoy a healthy product margin  obsolete 
in the future  if the market for our products is not as strong during the holiday seasons  whether as a result of changes in consumer tastes or because of an overall reduction in consumer demand due to economic conditions  we may fail to meet expectations of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall 
our success within the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to develop new products in response to rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards and product obsolescence 
our success is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive prices and performance levels 
the success of new products depends on a number of factors  including anticipation of market trends  timely completion of product development  design and testing  market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  offering new products at competitive prices  meeting performance  quality and functionality requirements of customers and oems  and meeting the timing  volume and price requirements of customers and oems 
our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards  however  we have no control over future modifications to these standards 
manufacturers may not continue to follow the current standards  which would make our products less desirable to manufacturers and reduce our sales 
our success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop new products in response to these changing industry standards 
our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures 
the markets for most of the applications for our chips are characterized by intense price competition 
the willingness of oems to design our chips into their products depends  to a significant extent  upon our ability to sell our products at cost effective prices 
we expect the asp of our existing products particularly our dvd decoder chip products to decline significantly over their product lives as the markets for our products mature  new products or technology emerge and competition increases 
during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded a charge of million for lower of cost and market reserves 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in product prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins  our gross margins may decline in the future 
we may lose business to competitors who have significant competitive advantages 
our existing and potential competitors consist  in part  of large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater intellectual property rights  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
our competitors also include a number of independent and emerging companies who may be able to better adapt to changing market conditions and customer demand 
in addition  some of our current and potential competitors maintain their own semiconductor fabrication facilities and could benefit from certain capacity  cost and technical advantages 
we expect that market experience to date and the predicted growth of the market will continue to attract and motivate more and stronger competitors 
dvd and vcd players face significant competition from video on demand  vcrs and other video formats 
in addition  we expect that the dvd platform for the dhs will face competition from other platforms including set top boxes  as well as multi function game boxes being manufactured and sold by large companies 
some of our competitors may be more diversified than us and supply chips for multiple platforms 
a decline in dvd sales may have a disproportionate effect on us as it is currently our most important product 
table of contents line 
any of these competitive factors could reduce our sales and market share and may force us to lower our prices  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent upon retaining key personnel and attracting new employees 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of fred sl chan  our chairman of the board  and robert l 
blair  our president and ceo 
in the past  mr 
chan has served as our president and chief executive officer in addition to being our chairman of the board 
mr 
chan is critical to maintaining many of our key relationships with customers  suppliers and foundries in asia 
the loss of the services of mr 
chan  mr 
blair  or any of our other key executives could adversely affect our business 
on october   patrick ang resigned as our executive vice president and chief operating officer 
while in the case of mr 
ang  it was for reasons unrelated to the company s business  we may not be able to retain our other key personnel and searching for key personnel replacements could divert the attention of other senior management and increase our operating expenses 
we currently do not maintain any key person life insurance 
additionally  to manage our future operations effectively  we will need to hire and retain additional management personnel  design personnel and software engineers 
we may have difficulty recruiting these employees or integrating them into our business 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly design personnel and software engineers  could make it difficult to implement our key business strategies  such as timely and effective product introductions 
we rely on a single distributor for a significant portion of our revenues and if this relationship deteriorates our financial results could be adversely affected 
sales through our largest distributor dynax electronics a hong kong based company were approximately  and of our net revenues as of the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
dynax electronics is not subject to any minimum purchase requirements and can discontinue marketing any of our products at any time 
in addition  dynax electronics has rights of return for unsold product and rights to pricing allowances to compensate for rapid  unexpected price changes  therefore we do not recognize revenue until dynax electronics sells through to our end customers 
if our relationship with dynax electronics deteriorates  our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly as we experience short term disruption to our sales and collection processes  particularly in light of the fact that we maintain significant accounts receivable from dynax electronics 
as our business grows  we may increasingly rely on distributors  which may reduce our exposure to future sales opportunities 
although we believe that we could replace dynax electronics as our distributor for the hong kong and china markets  there can be no assurance that we could replace dynax electronics in a timely manner or if a replacement were found that the new distributor would be as effective as dynax electronics in generating revenue for us 
our customer base is highly concentrated  so the loss of a major customer could adversely affect our business 
a substantial portion of our net revenues has been derived from sales to a small number of our customers 
during the fiscal year december   sales to our top five end customers including end customers that buy our products from our largest distributor dynax electronics accounted for approximately of our net revenues 
this risk is particularly acute in our digital imaging business  which currently has few customers and low sales volume 
we expect this concentration of sales to continue along with other changes in the composition of our customer base 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers or the loss of one or more major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial condition 

table of contents we may continue to expand into new businesses and product lines in which there may be a concentrated customer base and for which we may be required to purchase custom inventories to meet our customers needs 
we have in the past and will continue to regularly consider the expansion into new businesses and product lines by acquisition or otherwise 
as a result of our prior expansions into new businesses and new product lines  we may continue to sell our products to a highly concentrated customer base 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers or the loss of one or more major customers in these new businesses or product lines could render our venture in a new product line  such as digital imaging  unsuccessful  and resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of our acquisitions such as pictos  we currently purchase custom inventories for certain of our product lines such as image sensor modules for camera enabled cellular phones 
this custom inventory is highly tailored to each customer s specifications 
in the event that these customers reduce or cancel their orders for these products  we may not be able to re sell the custom inventory to any of our other customers 
we may also be forced to write off such custom inventory  which may result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use and we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures 
we have numerous patents granted in the united states with some corresponding foreign patents 
these patents will expire at various times 
we cannot assure you that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or applications in preparation or that any claims allowed from pending applications or applications in preparation will be of sufficient scope or strength 
we may not be able to obtain patent protection in all countries where our products can be sold 
also  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken to protect our intellectual property will adequately prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable determination for us 
any claim  even if without merit  may require us to spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or cross licensing arrangements  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may be required to pay substantial damages or cease the use and sale of infringing products  or both 
in general  a successful claim of infringement against us in connection with the use of our technologies could adversely affect our business and our results of operations could be significantly harmed 
see part i  item  legal proceedings 
we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation our business could be materially harmed 
we have significant international sales and operations that are subject to the special risks of doing business outside the united states 
substantially all of our sales are to customers including distributors in hong kong  taiwan  china  japan  singapore  korea and turkey 
during the fiscal year december   sales to customers in hong kong  taiwan and china were approximately of our net revenues 
if our sales in one of these countries or territories  such as hong kong  were to fall  our financial condition could be materially impaired 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues 
in addition  
table of contents substantially all of our products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
there are special risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements and related compliance problems  political  social and economic instability  lack of adequate protection of our intellectual property rights  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  including changes in most favored nations trading status  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles and greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax consequences  including withholding in connection with the repatriation of earnings and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  difficulties in obtaining export licenses for technologies  language and other cultural differences  which may inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our us and foreign counterparts  and currency exchange risks 
our products are manufactured by independent third parties 
we rely on independent foundries to manufacture all of our products 
substantially all of our products are currently manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  ltd  united microelectronics corporation and other independent asian foundries in asia 
our reliance on these or other independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the possibility of an interruption or loss of manufacturing capacity  reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and the inability to reduce our costs as rapidly as competitors who perform their own manufacturing and who are not bound by volume commitments to subcontractors at fixed prices 
any failure of these third party foundries to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
to address potential foundry capacity constraints in the future  we may be required to enter into arrangements  including equity investments in or loans to independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or take or pay contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
these arrangements could require us to commit substantial capital or to grant licenses to our technology 
if we need to commit substantial capital  we may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing  which could result in dilution to our shareholders 
because we are dependent upon a limited number of suppliers  we could experience delivery disruptions or unexpected product cost increases 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers to obtain adequate supplies of quality raw materials on a timely basis 
we do not generally have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
if we have difficulty in obtaining materials in the future  alternative suppliers may not be available  or if available  these suppliers may not provide materials in a timely manner or on favorable terms 
if we cannot obtain adequate materials for the manufacture of our products  we may be forced to pay higher prices  experience delays and our relationships with our customers may suffer 

table of contents in addition  we license certain technology from third parties that is incorporated into many of our key products 
if we are unable to obtain or license the technology on commercially reasonable terms and on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver products to our customers on competitive terms and in a timely manner and our relationships with our customers may suffer 
we have extended sales cycles  which increase our costs in obtaining orders and reduce the predictability of our earnings 
our potential customers often spend a significant amount of time to evaluate  test and integrate our products 
our sales cycles often last for several months and may last for up to a year or more 
these longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources prior to the generation of revenues and subject us to greater risk that customers may not order our products as anticipated 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
any cancellation or delay in ordering our products after a lengthy sales cycle could adversely affect our business 
our products are subject to recall risks 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of our products increase the risk that our customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults in our products 
these discoveries could occur after substantial volumes of product have been shipped  which could result in material recalls and replacement costs 
product recalls could also divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development needs and could adversely impact our customer relationships 
in addition  we could be subject to product liability claims that could distract management  increase costs and delay the introduction of new products 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand  the timing  length and volatility of which are difficult to predict 
downturns in the industry have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of asp 
upturns in the industry have been characterized by rising costs of goods sold and lack of production capacity at our suppliers 
these cyclical changes in demand and capacity  upward and downward  could significantly harm our business 
our quarterly net revenues and gross margin performance could be significantly impacted by these cyclical variations 
a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that the market will improve from a cyclical downturn or that cyclical performance will stabilize or improve 
we may need additional funds to execute our business plan  and if we are unable to obtain such funds  we may not be able to expand our business  and if we do raise such funds  your ownership in ess may be subject to dilution 
we may be required to obtain substantial additional capital to finance our future growth  fund our ongoing research and development activities and acquire new technologies or companies 
to the extent that our existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund our activities  we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time 
if our performance or prospects decrease  we may need to consummate a private placement or public offering of our capital stock at a lower price than you paid for your shares 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of new securities at a lower price than you paid for your shares  you will be subject to additional dilution 
further  such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us when needed or  if available  it may not be available on terms favorable to us 

table of contents the value of our common stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly 
many factors influence the price of our common stock  including future announcements concerning us  our competitors or our principal customers  such as quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  or litigation  changes in accounting rules  particularly those related to the expensing of stock options  the liquidity within the market for our common stock  sales by our officers  directors  other insiders and large shareholders  investor perceptions concerning the prospects of our business and the semiconductor industry  market conditions and investor sentiment affecting market prices of equity securities of high technology companies  and general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations 
we are incurring additional costs and devoting more management resources to comply with increasing regulation of corporate governance and disclosure 
we are spending an increased amount of management time and external resources to analyze and comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules and listing requirements 
devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards may result in increased general and administrative expenses and attention to these compliance activities and divert management s attention from our on going business operations 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to include an internal controls report of management s assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our annual report on form k 
our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to  and report on  our management s assessment 
in order to issue our report  our management must document both the design for our internal controls and the testing processes that support management s evaluation and conclusion 
during the course of testing our internal controls each year  we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate  document and retest in time  due to difficulties including those arising from turnover of qualified personnel  to meet the deadline for management to complete its report and our independent registered public accounting firm may not have sufficient time to retest those remediated deficiencies for its attestation of management s report 
upon the completion of our testing and documentation  certain deficiencies may be discovered that will require remediation  the costs of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
moreover  our independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with our management s assessment and may send us a deficiency notice that we are unable to remediate on a timely basis 
in addition  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time we may not be able to ensure that our management can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section and we may not be able to retain our independent registered public accounting firm with sufficient resources to attest to and report on our internal control 
in the future  if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated  if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on our management s evaluation or on the effectiveness of the internal controls  or if our independent registered public accounting firm expresses an adverse opinion on 
table of contents our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely impact our reported operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
technology companies like ours have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas allowed companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options  which would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value option expense recognition method 
we have previously applied apb and accordingly we generally have not recognized any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options were granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
on december   the fasb issued statement of sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for our quarter ending september  and will apply to all share based awards granted after the effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
sfas r will have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock options rather than disclosing the impact on our consolidated result of operations within our footnotes in accordance with the disclosure provisions of sfas this may result in lower reported earnings per share which could negatively impact our future stock price 
in addition  this could impact our ability to utilize broad based employee stock plans to reward employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes which may lead to changes in the market values of our investments 
foreign exchange risks we fund our operations with cash generated by operations  the sale of marketable securities and short and long term debt 
as we operate primarily in asia  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  our product sales and all of our arrangements with our foundries and test and assembly vendors are denominated in us dollars 
we have not entered into any currency hedging activities 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the foreign subsidiaries and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect 
interest rate risks we also invest in short term investments 
consequently  we are exposed to fluctuation in rates on these investments 
increases or decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair 
table of contents value of these investments 
in addition  the credit worthiness of the issuer  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument  and other general market conditions may affect the fair values of interest rate sensitive investments 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in interest rates  we invest in highly liquid governmental notes and bonds with contractual maturities of less than two years 
all of the investments have been classified as available for sale  and at december   the fair value of our investments approximated their costs 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments in public companies 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for business and strategic purposes and we have classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments  primarily in technology companies  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
our objective in managing our exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to our earnings and cash flows 
there are  however  a number of factors beyond our control 
continued market volatility  as well as mergers and acquisitions  have the potential to have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods 
we are also exposed to changes in the value of our investments in non public companies  including start up companies 
these long term equity investments in technology companies are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the industries in which these companies participate and other factors
