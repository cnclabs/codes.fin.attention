see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
effective with the september  reporting period  certain components of the company s strategic business units were reorganized to better align services offered to clients and to ensure a more integrated selling effort 
specifically  the company s clinical operations were consolidated by moving phase i and some small parts of the regulatory business from pcg to crs  and phase iv clinical operations from mms to crs 
the remaining businesses of pcg and mms were then combined to form the new pcms business segment 
these changes resulted in various reclassifications to the historical segment information presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in this annual report  but had no impact on the company s total revenue  expenses  operating income  net income  or balance sheet 
additionally  an accounting reclassification in the amount of million  million  and million for the fiscal years   and  respectively has been made from service revenue to other income loss to reflect a change in the accounting treatment with respect to the impact of foreign exchange rates on certain crs contracts denominated in a currency other than the prime contract holder s functional currency 
the change had no impact to expenses  net income  or earnings per share  but did impact gross margin and operating income 
the company conducts a significant portion of its operations in foreign countries 
approximately and of the company s service revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  were from non us operations 
because the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on its operating results 
for the fiscal year ended june   approximately of total service revenue was denominated in british pounds and approximately of total service revenue was denominated in euros 
for the fiscal year ended june   approximately of total service revenue was denominated in british pounds and approximately of total service revenue was denominated in euros 
as a result of the weakened us dollar against the british pound and the euro in fiscal year  the company s revenues and the company s costs increased in from the comparable period 
approximately of the company s contracts are fixed rate  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flow from these contracts typically consists of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized as work is performed 
as a result  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
generally  the company s clients can terminate their contracts with the company upon thirty to sixty days notice or can delay execution of services 
clients may terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including  among others merger or potential merger related activities involving the client  the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  client cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  or production problems resulting in shortages of the product 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company regards an accounting estimate underlying its financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to level of subjectivity and judgment involved or the susceptibility of such matter to change and if the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
the company believes that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results revenue recognition service revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized as services are performed 
the company measures progress for fixed price contracts using the concept of proportional performance based upon a unit based output method 
this method requires the company to estimate total expected units  as well as the costs and revenue per unit 
generally  the assigned financial manager or financial analyst reviews contract estimates on a monthly basis 
adjustments to contract estimates are made in the periods in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  there have not been any significant variations between contract estimates and the actual cost incurred which were not recovered from clients 
in the event that future estimates are materially incorrect  they could materially impact the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
billed accounts receivable  unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or payments received for which revenue has not yet been earned 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collectability and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
in the event the company is unable to collect portions of its outstanding billed or unbilled receivables  there may be a material impact to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
income taxes the company s global provision for corporate income taxes is calculated using the tax accounting rules established by sfas no 
income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before tax amongst the various taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates  adjusted as required by the tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction 
changes in the distribution of profits and losses between taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the provision is a combination of current year tax liability and future tax liability benefit that results from differences between book and taxable income that will reverse in future periods 
deferred tax assets and liabilities for these future tax effects are established on the company s balance sheet 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized 
monthly interim tax provision calculations are prepared during the year 
differences between these interim estimates and the final results for the year could materially impact the company s effective tax rate and its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing or more frequent testing if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit below its fair value 
the company has assessed the impairment of goodwill under sfas no 
in fiscal years and the impairment testing involves determining the fair market value of each of the reporting units with which the goodwill was associated and comparing the value with the reporting unit s carrying value 
based on this assessment  there was no impairment identified at june  and any future impairment of goodwill could have a material impact to the company s financial position or its results of operations

liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its operations and growth  including acquisition costs  with cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
investing activities primarily reflect acquisition costs and capital expenditures for information systems enhancements 
approximately of the company s contracts are fixed rate  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flow from these contracts typically consists of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized as work is performed 
as a result  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
days sales outstanding the company s operating cash flow is heavily influenced by changes in billed and unbilled receivables and deferred revenue 
these account balances as well as days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  net of deferred revenue  can vary based on contractual milestones and the timing and size of cash receipts 
days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable  net of deferred revenue  was days at june  and days at june  the increase in dso as of june as compared with june  was due primarily to slow collections and heavy levels of billing in june accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  was million million in billed accounts receivable and million in unbilled accounts receivable at june  and million million in billed accounts receivable and million in unbilled accounts receivable at june  deferred revenue was million at june  and million at june  days sales outstanding is calculated by adding the end of period balances for billed and unbilled account receivables  net of deferred revenue and allowances for doubtful accounts  then dividing the resulting amount by gross revenue service revenue  reimbursement revenue  and investigator fees for the most recent quarter  and multiplying the resulting fraction by the number of days in the quarter

net cash used by financing activities for the fiscal year totaled million as million generated from the issuance of common stock in connection with the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans and million from borrowings under lines of credit were essentially offset by million used to repurchase the company s common stock pursuant to its stock repurchase program 
lines of credit the company has a line of credit with abn amro bank  nv in the amount of euro million 
this line of credit is not collateralized  is payable on demand  and bears interest at a rate ranging between to 
the line of credit may be revoked or cancelled by the bank at any time at their discretion 
the company primarily entered into this line of credit to facilitate business transactions with the bank 
at june   the company had approximately euro million available under this line of credit 
the company has other foreign lines of credit with banks totaling approximately million 
these lines are used as overdraft protection and bear interest at rates ranging from to 
the lines of credit are payable on demand and are supported by parexel international corporation 
at june   the company had approximately million available under these credit arrangements 
the company has a cash pooling arrangement with abn amro bank 
pooling occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the net position is used as a basis by the bank for interest calculation 
each legal entity owned by the company and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit or debit balance 
therefore  interest income is earned in legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged in legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s overall balance  the bank then recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of previously charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference 
interest income and interest expense are recorded separately in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
financing needs the company s primary cash needs are for the payment of salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting expenses  business development costs  acquisition related costs  capital expenditures  and facilities related expenses 
the company s principal source of cash is from contracts with clients 
if the company is unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients and or if the level of contract cancellations increases  revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected see risk factors for further detail 
absent a material adverse change in the level of the company s new business bookings or contract cancellations  parexel believes that its existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs over the next months and on a longer term basis 
in the future  the company expects to consider acquiring businesses to enhance its service offerings  expand its therapeutic expertise  and or increase its global presence 
any such acquisitions may require additional external financing  and the company may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuance of equity or debt securities 
the company may be unable to secure such financing on terms acceptable to the company 
the company expects capital expenditures to total approximately million in fiscal year  primarily for computer software and hardware 
on september   the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million of the company s common stock to be repurchased in the open market subject to market conditions 
as of june   the company had acquired  shares at a total cost of million under this program

certain executive officers and directors of parexel held shares of perceptive common stock prior to the merger 
in addition  under the terms of the merger  parexel assumed all outstanding stock options under perceptive s stock incentive plan 
as a result  the holders of perceptive stock options are entitled to receive upon exercise of such options in cash  without interest  for each share of perceptive common stock that was subject to such options immediately prior to the merger 
none of the other terms and conditions of the perceptive stock options have changed 
the stock options will continue to be exercisable only upon payment of the exercise price of such options and to be subject to the vesting schedule to which such stock options were subject immediately prior to the merger 
certain executive officers and directors of parexel held stock options to purchase perceptive common stock prior to the merger 
additionally as part of the merger  parexel has also agreed to make payments totaling million to certain employees of perceptive on the first anniversary of the effective date of the merger  including  to an executive officer 
these payments are not conditioned on these employees remaining as employees of perceptive on the first anniversary of the effective date of the merger 
the terms and conditions of the merger were established and approved by a special committee of the board of directors of parexel consisting of two independent directors of parexel having no interests in perceptive  with consultation from an investment banking firm and legal counsel 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company disposed of a small business by closing an asset sale arrangement with a former non officer employee 
in association with the transaction  the buyer issued a four year promissory note to the company

recently issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the company adopted sfas r on july  using the prospective method as described in sfas no 
and is currently in the process of evaluating an acceptable option valuation model 
because statement r must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date  and because the company adopted statement using the prospective transition method which applied only to awards granted  modified or settled after the adoption date  compensation costs for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under statement will be recognized under statement r 
however  had the company adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company expects pre tax stock based compensation in fiscal year to be approximately million unaudited 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
requires that changes in accounting principle be retrospectively applied 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a
