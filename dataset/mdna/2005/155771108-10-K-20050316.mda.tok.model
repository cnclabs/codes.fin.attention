item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in this section we discuss the general financial condition and results of operations for central vermont public service corporation the company or we or our or us and its subsidiaries 
certain factors that may impact future operations are also discussed 
our discussion and analysis is based on  and should be read in conjunction with  the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
executive overview our consolidated earnings were million  or per diluted share of common stock  compared to earnings of million  or per diluted share of common stock  and earnings of million  or per diluted share of common stock 
in  discontinued operations of connecticut valley electric company inc connecticut valley contributed million  or per diluted share of common stock  to consolidated earnings 
this reflects a million after tax gain related to the january  sale of connecticut valley s plant assets and franchise 
in  discontinued operations of connecticut valley contributed million  or 
per diluted share of common stock  and it contributed million  or 
per diluted share of common stock  in the primary drivers of consolidated earnings for the past three years are discussed in detail in results of operations below 
for accounting purposes  components of the connecticut valley transaction in are recorded in both continuing and discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income 
the gain on the asset sale  net of tax  totaled million  but we recorded a loss on power costs  net of tax  of million relating to termination of the power contract between us and connecticut valley 
the loss is recorded as purchased power expense in the consolidated statement of income 
when the two accounting transactions are combined to assess the total impact of the transaction  the result is a gain of million  or 
per diluted share of common stock 
key financial initiatives for the company in included our request for a retail rate increase  discussed in vermont retail rates  refinancing second mortgage bonds that matured on august   discussed in liquidity and capital resources  our continued investments in vermont electric power corporation  discussed in liquidity and capital resources  catamount s continued investments in wind energy projects and the sale of certain of its investments in non wind energy projects  discussed in diversification  and january  sale of substantially all of connecticut valley s plant assets and its franchise  discussed in discontinued operations

page of company overview we are a vermont based electric utility that transmits  distributes and sells electricity and invests in renewable and independent power projects 
we are regulated by the vermont public service board psb  the connecticut department of public utility and control and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  with respect to rates charged for service  accounting  financing and other matters pertaining to regulated operations 
on january   our wholly owned regulated subsidiary  connecticut valley  sold its plant assets and franchise to public service company of new hampshire psnh 
prior to the sale  connecticut valley distributed and sold electricity in new hampshire  and its activities were regulated by the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc 
our wholly owned unregulated subsidiaries include catamount energy corporation catamount  which invests primarily in wind energy projects in the united states and united kingdom  and eversant corporation e versant  which operates a rental water heater business through its subsidiary  smartenergy water heating services  inc the vermont utility operation is our core business 
as a regulated electric utility we have an exclusive right to serve customers in our service territory  which can generally be expected to result in relatively stable revenue streams 
however  the ability to increase our customer base is limited to growth within the service territory  which has been relatively flat for several years 
given the nature of our customer base  weather and economic conditions are factors that can significantly affect our retail sales revenue 
we currently have sufficient power resources to meet our forecasted load requirements  mostly through long term power contracts 
we sell any excess power we have in the wholesale markets administered by iso new england or to third parties in new england 
such sales help to mitigate overall power costs  but wholesale power market volatility can affect these mitigation efforts 
our retail rates are set by the psb after considering recommendations of vermont s consumer advocate  the vermont department of public service dps 
while vermont does not have a fuel or power adjustment clause  it is customary for the psb to approve deferral of extraordinary costs incurred that might normally be expensed by unregulated businesses in order to match these expenses with future revenues 
vermont regulatory issues remain our top priority 
on july   we made two separate filings with the psb a cost of service filing in the psb s rate investigation  and a request for a percent rate increase 
we also continue to monitor several state initiatives  one of which could  over time  shift utility regulation away from cost based regulation 
in  we refinanced our million second mortgage bonds  which matured on august   by issuing million of first mortgage bonds 
the lower interest rates resulting from the refinancing will reduce annual interest expense by about million on a pre tax basis 
during  we invested million toward velco s planned transmission upgrade projects 
investments are made in catamount on a project level basis upon review and approval of the company s management and board of directors 
the vermont utility continues to generate sufficient cash flow to support ongoing operations 
however  the outcome of the current rate case could negatively impact the utility s ongoing cash flow 
while catamount has sufficient cash flow to cover its operating expenses  additional project investments will require financing or additional funding by the company 
catamount is also seeking investors and partners to co invest in the development  ownership and acquisition of projects 
see liquidity and capital resources below for more detail regarding cash flow  investment opportunities and the bond refinancing 
vermont retail rates our current retail rates are based on a june  psb order approving a settlement with the dps  which included a percent rate increase effective july  as part of the settlement  we also agreed to a million write off million after tax of regulatory assets and a rate freeze through january  the order also ended uncertainty over hydro quebec cost recovery by providing full cost recovery  made the january  temporary rates permanent  allowed the vermont utility a return on common equity of percent for the year ending june  capped through january  and created new service quality standards 
lastly  the rate order requires us to return up to million to ratepayers if there is a merger  acquisition or asset sale that requires psb approval 
in april  we filed cost of service studies for rate years and  in accordance with the psb s approval of the vermont yankee sale 
the purpose was to determine whether a rate decrease was warranted in either year as a result of the sale of the vermont yankee plant 
in july  we agreed to a memorandum of understanding mou with the dps regarding that filing 
the mou concluded that a rate decrease was not warranted  we would decrease our allowed page of return on common equity from percent to percent effective july   any earnings over the allowed cap of percent would be applied to reduce deferred charges on the balance sheet  we would file a fully allocated cost of service plan and a proposed rate redesign  and we would work cooperatively with the dps to develop and propose an alternative regulation plan 
hearings on the mou were conducted by the psb in december  and the psb issued an order on january  providing conditional approval for the mou 
it included the following significant modifications that the allowed return on common equity be reduced to percent  starting january  we would begin new amortizations of deferred charges on the balance sheet at december  of about million annually  and that we would file with the psb a proposal to apply the million payment we received in connection with the connecticut valley sale to write down deferred charges 
on february   we filed a request for reconsideration and clarification  and in march participated in a workshop to review the filing 
on april   the psb denied our request 
while the psb agreed to remove the third modification  absent our acceptance of the remaining modifications  the psb concluded that it would open a rate investigation 
consequently  the psb issued an order opening investigation and notice of prehearing conference in docket no 
to investigate current rates 
on july   we filed a cost of service study in the rate investigation that demonstrated a rate deficiency of percent  and recommended that rates should not be decreased retroactively to april  also on july   we filed a request with the psb for a percent rate increase  expected to be effective april   and requested that the two cases be consolidated 
on september   the psb consolidated the two cases and confirmed a schedule for proceedings through  with a final order in march on october   the dps filed its testimony with the psb related to the rate investigation and our request for a rate increase 
the dps s major findings and recommendations included a rate refund to ratepayers retroactive to april  of percent or million  and a rate reduction of percent or almost million on an annual basis effective with service rendered april  on october   aarp  an intervener in the case  filed testimony that supported a rate increase of up to percent effective april  technical hearings with the psb began in early november hearings and filings continued through february in filings with the psb on february and   the dps suggested a rate refund or credit to our ratepayers retroactive to april  of about percent or million  and a rate reduction of about percent or million effective with service rendered april  while supporting the dps position  aarp proposed the following modifications allow a percent return on equity the dps recommended percent  amortize deferred debits over a six year period the dps recommended a three year period  and exclude the costs associated with or resulting from the connecticut valley asset sale from our cost of service 
on february   the psb approved our request for an accounting order that  among other things  allowed for deferral of certain utility earnings 
the approved accounting order permitted us to record in other regulatory liabilities any earnings achieved by the utility in excess of the percent return on equity 
the earnings to be deferred were calculated by the same method we used for determining and reporting earnings for  and under the mandated earnings cap of percent per our july psb approved rate order 
in  utility earnings above the percent return on equity amounted to million pre tax 
we recorded this pre tax amount as a regulatory liability  which will be accounted for as determined by the psb in its final order 
the issuance of the accounting order does not create any expectations  set any precedent  or in any other way impair the psb s ability to rule on the contested issues in our rate case 
the dps opposed our request for an accounting order and expressed concern that psb approval of the accounting order would create the perception that regulators supported our proposed percent return on equity and the method for calculating the earnings cap for the to period 
the dps suggested alternative methods to mitigate the financial impacts of a potential adverse decision 
those alternatives were not accepted by the psb 
however  the psb s approval of the accounting order made clear that the percent return on equity and the method for calculating overearnings for the period of to are in dispute in the rate proceedings and that the accounting order does not decide these issues 
page of the last psb hearing was held on february and the parties filed reply briefs on february  our february  reply brief demonstrates that a reduction in rates for the period april  through march  would not be just or reasonable 
instead a modest increase about percent in our rates beginning april  is justified 
we based our conclusion on the terms of the power cost settlement reached with the dps and application of the million deferred earnings to reduce deferred charges eligible for recovery in rates 
both of these items require approval by the psb 
a final decision from the psb is expected on march  we cannot predict the outcome of the rate case at this time 
energy initiatives in vermont the state of vermont continues to examine changes to the provision of electric service absent introduction of retail choice 
the following discussion highlights initiatives of potential significance 
renewable portfolio standard in and several bills were introduced in the vermont general assembly to establish a renewable portfolio standard rps requirement 
the introduction of an rps could require that we purchase certain amounts of our energy supply requirement from new renewable sources while maintaining existing renewable power content 
although none of those bills were enacted into law  there remains an interest in rps  and several proposals have been introduced in the legislative session 
these proposals are similar to a proposal in the psb s report to the vermont general assembly 
based on activity in the current legislative session  we expect that a mandatory rps  in some form  will be approved 
renewable pricing programs beginning in  the vermont general assembly authorized the establishment of utility sponsored renewable pricing programs to permit customers to voluntarily elect to purchase all or part of their electric energy from renewable sources  or cause the purchase and retirement of tradable renewable energy credits on the participating customers behalf 
in either case  the purpose of such pricing programs is to increase the utility s reliance on renewable sources of energy beyond those the utility would otherwise be required to provide under its psb approved integrated resource plan 
our first renewable pricing program  cvps cow power tm  was approved by the psb on july  the program promotes the production of renewable energy from cow manure from certain vermont farms  and was made available to customers for energy use starting september  pricing for the program is in the form of a premium relative to the tariff that would otherwise appl y 
the premium is cost based so that it reasonably reflects the difference between acquiring the renewable energy and our alternative cost of power 
the program also requires that any costs of power in excess of our alternative cost of power be borne by those customers participating in the program 
by year end  about customers had signed up for cvps cow power tm 
alternative forms of regulation in  the vermont general assembly authorized alternative forms of regulation for electric utilities that  besides other criteria  establish a reasonably balanced system of risks and rewards to encourage utilities to operate as efficiently as possible 
the psb may only approve an alternative regulation plan if it finds that the plan will not adversely affect our eligibility for rate regulated accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and reasonably preserves the availability of equity and debt capital resources to us on favorable terms and conditions 
at this time  we have not sought authorization to implement an alternate form of regulation 
business risks regulatory risk on july   we made two separate filings with the psb a cost of service in the psb s rate investigation  and a request for a percent rate increase 
these matters are discussed in more detail above 
historically  electric utility rates in vermont have been based on a utility s costs of service 
as a result  electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that apply only to regulated businesses 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
allows regulated entities  such as the company  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
the company currently complies with the provisions of sfas no 
for its regulated vermont service territory and ferc regulated wholesale businesses 
if we determine the company no longer meets the criteria under sfas no 
 the accounting impact would be an extraordinary charge to operations of about million on a pre tax basis as of december   assuming no stranded cost recovery w ould be allowed through a rate mechanism 
page of although not currently under consideration  if retail competition were implemented in our vermont service territory  we are unable to predict the impact on our revenues  our ability to retain existing customers with respect to their power supply purchases and attract new customers or the margins that will be realized on retail sales of electricity  if any such sales are sought 
wholesale power market risk our material power supply contracts and arrangements are principally with hydro quebec and vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vynpc 
these contracts support the majority of our total annual energy mwh purchases 
our exposure to market price volatility is limited for power supply purchases given that our long term power forecast reflects energy amounts in excess of that required to meet load requirements 
however  if one or both of these sources becomes unavailable for an extended period of time  we would be subject to wholesale power price volatility and that amount could be material 
additionally  we rely on the sale of our excess power to help mitigate overall net power costs and price risk 
the volatility of wholesale power market prices can impact these mitigation efforts 
we also continue to monitor  and adapt to  changes to new england wholesale power markets and open access transmission systems 
these are discussed in more detail in power supply matters below 
inflation the annual rate of inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  was percent for  percent for and percent for our revenues are based on rate regulation that generally recognizes only historical costs  therefore  inflation continues to have an impact on most aspects of the business 
unregulated business catamount is wholly focused on the development  ownership and asset management of wind energy projects 
catamount s future success is dependent on continued acceptance of wind power as an energy source by large producers  utilities and other purchasers of electricity 
in addition  many potential customers believe that wind energy is an unpredictable and inconsistent resource  is uneconomic compared to other sources of power and does not produce stable voltage and frequency 
there is no guarantee of wind power acceptance by potential customers as an energy source 
the following highlights the wind related risks that we believe are most critical to catamount 
wind resource and weather pattern risks generation of electricity by wind energy projects is highly dependent upon wind conditions at the site 
although wind energy projects are developed with careful review of available historic wind and weather patterns at a particular site  there is no assurance that catamount can accurately forecast future long term wind resources at any one site 
in addition  average wind speeds and resources can vary widely in any year  resulting in significant annual revenue variability 
power purchase agreement risk catamount will only invest in wind power projects that have power purchase agreements in place with acceptable third parties 
the creditworthiness of such acceptable third parties varies and can result in risk to catamount 
additionally  competitive bidding generally has reduced the price utilities pay independent power producers  which  in turn  reduces the profitability of many independent power projects 
wind turbine generator technology risk wind turbine generators wtgs of the size catamount intends to utilize have only been commercially available for three or four years 
long term reliability of this equipment has yet to be proven 
wind turbine technology is rapidly changing with wtgs growth in size and rated output every year 
problems with key components in newer turbine models without long track records could result in unexpected availability losses  increased and unbudgeted maintenance and repair costs  and lack of electric production affecting revenue generations 
wind energy projects typically consist of many wtgs of one particular make and model 
therefore  any failure of a key component could result in serial failures of such component throughout the wind energy project  resulting in significantly diminished revenues and materially increased maintenance and repair costs 
dependence on governmental policies the wind energy industry is highly dependent upon governmental policies and laws enacted to stimulate growth of clean renewable energy through tax credits and other incentive plans  including mandatory purchasing requirements by local utilities of renewable energy  including wind energy 
while the trend worldwide is to increase the use of renewable energy sources  there is no assurance that any particular governmental policy or tax credit or incentive program will be continued in any jurisdiction where catamount conducts business 
credit risk recent events  including uncertainties concerning operations of wholesale markets and the demise of major wholesale power marketing companies  have increased credit concerns in the energy industry specifically with unregulated energy companies 
obtaining or renewing corporate credit facilities is challenging and there is no guarantee credit will either be extended or renewed 
catamount terminated its credit facility in may catamount solicits  as needed  proposals from selected financial institutions for corporate and or development credit facilities that will meet its business needs 
catamount cannot predict whether it will be able to ultimately solicit and enter into an appropriately priced corporate and or development credit facility 
page of capital requirements catamount will require additional capital to pursue its business plan 
catamount is seeking investors and partners to co invest in the development  ownership and acquisition of projects 
there can be no assurance that catamount will be successful in securing a partner or obtaining additional funding from us

discontinued operations on january   connecticut valley completed the sale of substantially all of its plant assets and its franchise to psnh 
the sale  including termination of the power contract between us and connecticut valley  resolved all connecticut valley restructuring litigation in new hampshire and our stranded cost litigation at ferc 
cash proceeds from the sale amounted to about million  with million representing the net book value of connecticut valley s plant assets plus certain other adjustments  and million as described below 
in return  psnh acquired connecticut valley s franchise  poles  wires  substations and other facilities  and several independent power obligations 
as a condition of the sale  connecticut valley paid us million to terminate its long term power contract 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 in the first quarter of  we recorded a million pre tax loss accrual related to termination of the power contract 
the loss accrual represented management s best estimate of the difference between expected future sales revenue  in the wholesale market  for the purchased power that was formerly sold to connecticut valley and the cost of purchased power obligations 
see discussion of reserve for loss on power contract in critical accounting policies below 
for accounting purposes  components of the sale transaction are recorded in both continuing and discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement 
in  income from discontinued operations included a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of about million  pre tax  or million  after tax  reflecting the million payment from psnh  net of various other adjustments 
in addition to the gain on disposal  we recorded a loss on power costs  net of tax  of million relating to termination of the power contract with connecticut valley as described above 
the loss is included in purchased power on the consolidated statement of income 
when the two accounting transactions are combined to assess the total impact of the sale  the result is a gain of million recorded in on january   connecticut valley also paid in full a million inter company promissory note that was payable to us 
there are no remaining significant business activities related to connecticut valley 
summarized results of operations of the discontinued operations are as follows in thousands for the years ended december operating revenues operating expenses purchased power other operating expenses income tax benefit expense total operating expenses operating loss income other expense  net net loss income  net of tax gain from disposal  net of  tax income from discontinued operations  net of tax purchased power in the table above includes about million in and million in related to the purchase of power from the company  under connecticut valley s long term contract with the company 
these amounts are included in operating revenue on the consolidated statements of income 
accounts receivable from connecticut valley were of a nominal amount in and million in page of the major classes of assets and liabilities reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets are as follows in thousands assets net utility plant other current assets total assets of discontinued operations liabilities accounts payable short term debt a total liabilities of discontinued operations a related to an inter company note that was paid on january  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
the decrease resulted from the following million used by investing activities mostly for catamount investments  construction expenditures  investment in velco and investments in available for sale securities as described below  partly offset by sales of projects from catamount s portfolio  million used in financing activities primarily related to dividends paid on common and preferred stock and retirement of long term debt and preferred stock  million provided by operating activities  and million provided by discontinued operations 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased million 
the decrease resulted from the following million used by investing activities for available for sale securities  construction expenditures  partially offset by the vermont yankee sale proceeds received in  million used in financing activities mostly related to retirement of long term debt and dividends paid on common and preferred stock and million for restricted cash used to reduce non utility long term debt and redeemable preferred stock  and million provided by operating activities 
in the first quarter of  we invested proceeds received from the connecticut valley sale and other cash on hand in available for sale securities with various maturities 
at december   these investments included million with maturities from days up to one year and million with maturities greater than one year 
we are considering investment alternatives and plan to continue investing additional funds in vermont electric power corporation  inc s velco planned transmission upgrades 
our investments in velco will contribute toward increasing velco s common equity from about percent to percent of its total capitalization 
on august   ferc approved our joint filing with green mountain power corporation gmp for authorization to purchase stock to be issued by velco in and in connection with financing its planned transmission upgrades 
we invested about million in december and intend to invest about million in the latter part of velco will require additional equity capital beyond in order to finance all of the proposed transmission upgrades and we will consider additional investments in velco 
in total  our investments in velco  including our december investment  could amount to about million to million through catamount has sufficient cash flow to cover its ongoing operating expenses  but additional project investments will require financing or additional funding from us 
catamount is also seeking investors and partners to co invest in the development  ownership and acquisition of projects 
we believe that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our business for the foreseeable future  although without a rate increase  vermont utility cash flow from operations will decrease in when compared to material risks to cash flow from operations include adverse rate case outcome  loss of retail sales revenue from unusual weather  slower than anticipated load growth and unfavorable economic conditions  and increases in net power costs largely due to lower than anticipated margins on sales revenue from excess power 
page of capital commitments and contractual obligations the vermont utility is a capital intensive operation  as it requires annual construction expenditures to maintain the distribution system 
our capital expenditure plan is expected to range from million to million for the three year period between and our significant contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in the table below 
contractual obligations payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt utility interest on long term debt utility a redeemable preferred stock purchased power contracts b nuclear decommissioning and other closure costs c capital leases operating vehicle lease a total contractual obligations a 
based on interest rates as of december  b 
includes power contract commitments with hydro quebec  vynpc and various independent power producers 
see power supply matters below for more information related to these contracts 
c 
includes estimated decommissioning and all other closure costs related to maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic 
see power supply matters below for more information regarding these plants 
pension and postretirement benefits see note to the consolidated financial statements for expected cash flows related to pension and postretirement benefits 
financing utility on july   we issued million of percent first mortgage bonds  due in  and million of percent first mortgage bonds  due in the proceeds were used to repay in full our million second mortgage bonds  at a rate of percent that matured on august  the refinancing and lower interest rates will reduce annual interest expense by about million on a pre tax basis 
the first mortgage bonds are callable at our option at any time upon payment of a make whole premium  calculated as the excess of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments to bondholders  discounted at a rate that is percent higher than the comparable us treasury bond yield  over the early redemption amount 
currently  the vermont industrial development authority bonds and the connecticut development authority bonds are callable at par at the option of the company or bondholders on each monthly interest payment date  or at the option of the bondholders on any business day 
we have always been able to remarket any bonds submitted for prepayment by the bondholders 
the new hampshire industrial development authority bonds are no longer callable at our option or at the bondholders option  except in special circumstances involving unenforceability of the indenture or a change in the usability of the project 
none of our debt financing documents contain cross default provisions to affiliates outside of the consolidated entity 
certain of our debt financing documents contain cross default provisions to our wholly owned subsidiaries  east barnet  cv realty and custom investment corporation 
these cross default provisions generally relate to an inability to pay debts or debt acceleration  inappropriate affiliate transactions or the levy of significant judgments or attachments against our property 
currently  we are not in default under any of our debt financing documents 
based on outstanding debt at december   no principal payments are due on long term debt from through at december   substantially all utility property and plant were subject to liens under the first mortgage bond indenture 
also  the first mortgage bond indenture restricts financial support to catamount and other unregulated subsidiaries at million plus percent of annual net income starting january and prevents any guarantee of catamount s or other unregulated subsidiaries obligations 
in return  the first mortgage bond indenture eliminates the risk of cross default by catamount and other unregulated subsidiaries 
page of at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our various debt agreements  articles of association and letters of credit  these agreements contain financial and non financial covenants 
dividend restrictions the first mortgage bond indenture and the company s articles of association contain certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends on capital stock 
under the most restrictive of such provisions  approximately million of retained earnings was not subject to dividend restriction at december  non utility in january  catamount paid off a million balance on its term loan  and in february  catamount notified the lender of its intent to terminate the credit facility 
effective may   the credit facility was officially terminated 
catamount s office building mortgage matured on april   and catamount paid the outstanding balance in full 
catamount solicits  as needed  proposals from selected financial institutions for corporate and or development credit facilities that will meet its business needs 
catamount cannot predict whether it will be able to ultimately enter into an appropriately priced corporate and or development credit facility 
as part of its windfarm development efforts  in august  catamount entered into a construction lending arrangement for about million for a wind project located in the united states 
at december   catamount advanced million for construction of the project 
on february   the construction loan was paid off and catamount made an equity investment in the wind project  referred to as sweetwater in november  catamount entered into an agreement with a third party developer for the purchase of wind turbines for a joint development project 
pursuant to the agreement  catamount made a total of million of payments to the turbine supplier in the fourth quarter of the turbine supply agreement calls for payments of million in march and million in september  with the remaining contract amount of million due based on milestones established in the agreement 
catamount expects third party construction financing  for the wind project that the turbine agreement is associated with  to be in place in the second quarter of once the construction financing is in place  catamount would be relieved of making the september and remaining payments to the turbine supplier 
the turbine supply agreement allows for termination in full up to days prior to the delivery of the first turbines 
after that date  catamount can terminate future turbines partial terminati on days prior to scheduled delivery 
in the event of a termination of the turbine supply agreement in whole or in part for the joint development project  the third party developer or catamount has up to months from the termination date to utilize the turbines and receive reimbursement of percent of the turbine down payments 
off balance sheet arrangements letters of credit we renewed million of unsecured letters of credit issued by a financial institution to november  these letters of credit support three series of industrial development revenue bonds  totaling million 
at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under these letters of credit 
operating leases we lease our vehicles and related equipment under one operating lease agreement 
the leases are mutually cancelable one year from each individual lease inception 
we have the ability to lease vehicles and related equipment up to an aggregate unamortized balance of million  of which about million was outstanding for the years ended and under the terms of the vehicle operating lease  we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor in the event the leased items are sold 
the guarantee provides for reimbursement of up to percent of the unamortized value of the lease portfolio 
under the guarantee  if the entire lease portfolio had a fair value of zero at december   we would have been responsible for a maximum reimbursement of million and at december   we would have been responsible for a maximum reimbursement of million 
we had a liability of million at december  representing our obligation under the guarantee based on the fair market value of the entire portfolio 
other operating lease commitments are considered minimal  as most are cancelable after one year from inception 
total rental expense  including the operating lease agreement described above  included in the determination of net income  amounted to about million in  million in and million in power supply commitments we have material power supply commitments that are discussed in detail in note commitments and contingencies 
page of equity investments we own an equity interest in velco in which we are required to pay a portion of velco s operating costs based on our network load percentage and to contribute additional capital if velco s transmission rates do not provide for full cost recovery 
we own an equity interest in vynpc in which we are obligated to pay a portion of vynpc s operating costs based on our entitlement percentage 
see note investments in affiliates for additional information related to these equity investments 
other we do not use off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as securitization of receivables  or obtain access to assets through special purpose entities 
credit ratings on november   standard poor s s p affirmed our corporate credit rating at bbb  and reported the rating outlook as stable 
s p indicated that the affirmation was based upon an average business profile and a somewhat below average financial profile 
our financial profile is pressured by adjustments made by s p related to some of our long term purchased power contracts 
our business profile is characterized by a diverse customer mix  stable demand growth and low operating risk 
these strengths are offset by significant regulatory uncertainty and our continued commitment to non regulated businesses  including wind power projects in the united states and united kingdom 
s p s stable outlook was based upon expectations that our regulatory environment will not deteriorate and that future financial support of unregulated businesses will be measured 
on december   fitch ratings fitch upgraded our preferred stock rating to bbb from bb 
fitch also affirmed our first mortgage bond rating at bbb and reported the rating outlook as stable 
fitch indicated that the higher ratings reflect the company s strengthening credit measures and lower business risk related to the rate order  which provided full recovery of hydro quebec purchased power agreement costs 
another factor was the sale of vermont yankee  eliminating the company s nuclear operating risk 
our credit is currently investment grade 
credit ratings should not be considered a recommendation to purchase stock 
current credit ratings are as follows standard poor s fitch corporate credit rating bbb n a first mortgage bonds bbb bbb preferred stock bb bbb outlook stable capitalization our capitalization for the past two years is as follows amount in millions percent common stock equity preferred stock long term debt capital lease obligations includes current portion critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  requiring us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements

 the company s rates must be designed to recover its costs of providing service and the company must be able to collect those rates from customers 
if rate recovery of these costs becomes unlikely or uncertain  whether due to competition or regulatory action  this accounting standard would no longer apply to our regulated operations 
criteria that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas no 
include increasing competition that restricts the ability to establish prices to recover specific costs  and a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to another form of regulation 
we periodically review these criteria to ensure that the continuing application of sfas no 
is appropriate 
if we determine the company no longer meets the criteria under sfas no 
 the accounting impact would be an extraordinary charge to operations of about million on a pre tax basis as of december   assuming no stranded cost recovery would be allowed through a rate mechanism 
based on a current evaluation of the factors and conditions expected to impact future cost recovery  we believe future recovery of our regulatory assets in the state of vermont for our retail and wholesale businesses is probable 
discontinued operations the assets and liabilities of connecticut valley are classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with sfas no 
in addition  as required by sfas no 
 the results of operations related to connecticut valley are reported as discontinued operations  and prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation 
for presentation purposes  certain of the company s common corporate costs  which were previously allocated to connecticut valley  have been reallocated back to continuing operations to reflect the sale s impact on continuing operations 
these common costs amounted to about million in  million in and million in  on an after tax basis 
we began to present connecticut valley as discontinued operations in the second quarter of based on the nhpuc s approval of the sale of connecticut valley s plant assets and franchise to psnh 
prior to the second quarter of  connecticut valley was repo rted as a separate segment 
unregulated business results of operations of our unregulated subsidiaries are included in the other income and deductions section of the consolidated statements of income 
catamount s policy is to expense all screening  feasibility and development expenditures associated with determining viability of investments in new projects 
catamount s project costs incurred subsequent to obtaining financial viability are recognized as assets subject to depreciation or amortization 
project viability is obtained when it becomes probable that costs incurred will generate future economic benefits sufficient to recover these costs 
catamount evaluates the carrying value of its investments on a quarterly basis  or when events and circumstances warrant 
the carrying value is considered impaired when the anticipated fair value  based on undiscounted cash flows  is less than the carrying value of each investment 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment 
in  catamount determined that its investments in wind projects in germany were impaired by about million based on their current market value  and its appomattox investment was impaired by about million 
in  catamount determined that its investments in rupert and glenns ferry were impaired by amounts that were not significant  and in  catamount recorded after tax asset impairment charges of million related to certain of its investments 
these asset impairments were based on underlying purchase and sale contracts 
see diversification below for additional information 
revenues electricity sales to customers are based on monthly meter readings 
estimated unbilled revenues are recorded at the end of each monthly accounting period 
in order to determine unbilled revenues  we make various estimates including energy generated  purchased and resold  losses of energy over transmission and distribution lines  kilowatt hour usage by retail customer mix residential  commercial and industrial  and average retail customer pricing rates 
we use these estimated amounts to calculate the amount of revenue that has been earned  but not billed  due to the timing of billing cycles used for retail customers 
page of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we recognize tax assets and liabilities for the cumulative effect of all temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
investment tax credits associated with utility plant are deferred and amortized ratably to income over the lives of the related properties 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management determines it is more likely than not such tax assets will not be realized 
see income tax issues below for additional information 
reserve for loss on power contract in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 we recorded a million pre tax loss accrual related to termination of our long term power contract with connecticut valley in the contract was terminated as a condition of the connecticut valley sale 
the loss accrual represented management s best estimate of the difference between expected future sales revenue  in the wholesale market  for the purchased power that was formerly sold to connecticut valley and the cost of purchased power obligations 
the estimated life of the power contracts that were in place to supply power to connecticut valley extends through the loss accrual was estimated based on assumptions about future power prices  the reallocation of power from the state appointed purchasing agent veppi and future load growth 
management will continue to review this estimate at the end of each reporting period and will increase the reserve if the revised estimate exceeds the recorded loss accrual 
additionally  the loss accrual is being amortized on a straight line basis  as required by gaap  through in  we recorded million of amortization 
the loss accrual and amortization are included in purchased power on the consolidated statement of income in the amount of million for the period ended december  derivative financial instruments we account for various power contracts as derivatives under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   which amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments collectively sfas no 

these statements require that derivatives be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
adoption and application of these statements did not impact our results of operation 
at december   we had two power contract derivatives  one valued at quoted market prices and one based on modeling techniques  as described below 
our long term contracts for the purchase of power from vynpc and independent power producers do not meet the definition of a derivative under the requirements of sfas no 
because delivery of power under these contracts is contingent on plant output 
additionally  our long term power contract with hydro quebec does not meet the definition of a derivative because there is no defined notional amount 
see discussion of power supply matters below for additional information related to these contracts 
we have a long term purchased power contract that allows the seller to repurchase specified amounts of power with advance notice hydro quebec sellback 
this contract has been determined to be a derivative and is being accounted for under sfas no 
the derivative s year end estimated fair value was an unrealized loss of million in and an unrealized loss of million in the change in value for versus reflects higher forecasted market prices during the contract term 
the estimated fair value of this derivative is valued using a binomial tree model  and quoted market data when available along with appropriate valuation methodologies 
in november  we entered into two forward sale contracts  one through october and one through december the sole purpose of entering into these contracts is to manage price risk from power supply resources used to serve our customers 
we enter into forward sale contracts when we forecast excess supply  and to minimize the net costs and risk of serving our customers 
both of these forward sale contracts require the physical delivery of power  but one is contingent upon vermont yankee plant output 
we have assessed these two contracts and determined that one is a derivative under sfas no 
 and the other  due to the unit contingent nature of the contract  is not a derivative 
the derivative contract is for delivery of about mw per hour  or a total of  mwh for the contract term  which extends from november  through december  at december   this contract had an estimated fair value of a million unrealized gain 
we used over the counter quotations or broker quotes at december  to determine the fair value of this contract 
page of in december  we entered into a forward sale contract for about  mwh for the period beginning january and ending march   and a forward purchase contract for about  mwh for the month of april we entered into these contracts to minimize the net costs and risks of serving customers  including replacement power related to the vermont yankee plant s april scheduled refueling outage 
we determined that both contracts did not meet the normal purchase and sale exclusion under sfas no 
at december   the forward sale contract had an estimated fair value of a million unrealized gain  and the forward purchase contract had an estimated fair value of a million unrealized loss 
we used over the counter quotations or broker quotes at december  to determine the fair value of these contracts 
these derivative contracts were settled by december   and are included in operating revenue or purchased power on the consolidated statement of income f or we record derivative contracts on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
based on a psb approved accounting order  the changes in fair value are recorded as deferred charges or deferred credits on the consolidated balance sheets depending on whether the fair value is an unrealized loss or gain 
decommissioning cost estimates accounting for decommissioning costs of nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to decommissioning costs to be incurred many years in the future 
primary drivers of changes to these estimates include  but are not limited to  increases in projected costs of spent fuel storage  security and liability and property insurance 
we own  through equity investments  percent of maine yankee  percent of connecticut yankee and percent of yankee atomic 
all three plants are completely shut down and are conducting decommissioning activities 
we are responsible for paying our equity ownership percentage of decommissioning costs and all other costs for these plants 
as of december   based on the most recent estimates provided  our share of remaining costs to decommission these nuclear units is about million for maine yankee  million for connecticut yankee and million for yankee atomic 
these estimates are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as nuclear decommissioning liabilities current and non current with a corresponding regulatory asset or other deferred charge 
we will adjust associated regulatory assets  other deferred charges and nuclear decommissioning liabilities when revised estimates are provided 
based on the current regulatory process  we believe our proportionate shares of maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic decommissioning costs will be recovered through rates 
see power supply matters nuclear generating companies below for more information 
we are also responsible for our joint ownership percentage of millstone unit decommissioning costs  and we have an external trust to fund our share of decommissioning costs 
contributions to the trust fund have been suspended based on the lead owner s representation to various regulatory bodies that the trust fund  for its share of the plant  exceeded the nuclear regulatory commission s minimum calculation required 
we could choose to renew funding at our discretion as long as the minimum requirement is met or exceeded 
currently  we are recovering these costs in rates 
prior to january   these amounts were applied to reduce certain regulatory assets 
since january   funds collected through retail rates are being recorded as a regulatory liability  which is being addressed in our current rate proceeding 
pension and postretirement benefits we record pension and other postretirement benefit costs in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and those assumed is a required principle of these standards 
this approach allows for systematic recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the following assumptions are reviewed annually  for a september measurement date discount rate the discount rate is used to record the value of benefits  which are based on future projections  in terms of today s dollars 
the selection methodology used in determining the discount rate includes portfolios of aa bonds  all are united states issues and non callable or callable with make whole features and each issue is at least million 
as of september   the discount rate remained at percent 
expected return on plan assets roa we project the future roa based principally on historical returns by asset category and expectations for future returns  based in part on simulated capital market performance over the next years 
the projected future value of assets reduces the benefit obligation a company will record 
at september   the roa was percent 
this rate was used to determine the annual expense for and the same rate will be used to determine the expense 
page of rate of compensation increase we project employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
as of september   the rate of compensation increase remained at percent 
health care cost trend we project expected increases in the cost of health care 
for measurement purposes  we assumed an percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for pre claims  and a percent increase for post claims  for fiscal these assumptions were based on expected higher health care costs 
amortization of gains losses we can select the method by which gains or losses are recognized in financial results 
these gains or losses are created when actual results differ from estimated results based on the above assumptions 
we recognize these gains and losses ratably over a five year period 
pension costs and cash funding requirements are expected to increase in future years 
as of december   the market value of pension plan trust assets was million  including million in marketable equity securities and million in debt securities 
pension plan trust assets were million at december   including million in marketable equity securities and million in debt securities 
favorable market returns of about million in and about million in helped to offset the adverse effect of sharp declines in the capital markets in and annual pension cost increased by million in of that amount  million is reflected in results of operations and the remaining amount is capitalized 
postretirement costs also increased by million for due to higher than expected medical claims experience 
of that amount  million is reflected in results of operations and the remaining amount was capitalized 
pension and postretirement assumption sensitivity analysis fluctuations in market returns may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods

this discussion follows the order of the consolidated income statements 
operating revenues the majority of our operating revenues are generated through retail sales from the regulated vermont utility business 
other resale sales are related to the sale of excess power from our owned and purchased power supply portfolio

vs 
retail revenues change in mwh volume change in price customer mix subtotal firm resale sales rs power contract other resale sales other revenues increase decrease in operating revenues vs 
operating revenues decreased million  or percent  in compared to due to the following factors retail and firm sales increased million primarily due to higher sales volume 
these sales are affected by weather and economic conditions 
lower average industrial prices due to higher usage per customer partially offset the favorable effect of higher sales volume 
the january  termination of the power contract with connecticut valley decreased resale revenue by million  but made about  mwh available for use by the company or for other resale sales 
the effects of the contract termination are reflected as higher resale revenue or lower short term purchases 
page of other resale revenue increased million due to higher average market prices  partly offset by lower sales volume 
the lower volume resulted from fewer mwh available for resale due to scheduled nuclear plant outages at vermont yankee and millstone unit in the second quarter of  and a day unscheduled outage at the vermont yankee plant that ended july  the lower volume was partially offset by termination of the connecticut valley power contract 
other operating revenue increased million primarily due to service billings related to mutual aid work in florida 
revenue related to fees charged for use of utility poles  referred to as pole attachments  increased as a result of a field inventory completed in  and transmission revenue also increased slightly 
vs 
operating revenues increased million  or percent  in compared to due to the following factors retail and firm sales increased million primarily due to a percent increase in sales volume 
these sales are affected by weather and economic conditions 
in  colder weather in the first quarter increased residential sales volume  while relatively weak economic conditions decreased sales volume for our commercial and industrial customers 
sales to connecticut valley under the rs power contract decreased million due to lower volume and lower unit costs under the contract 
other resale sales increased million due to higher rates for contract sales and wholesale market prices in iso new england and more power available for resale in the higher contract rates were related to a forward sale in in which we sold about  mwh during the period february through december in most of our resale sales were made at iso new england market prices 
we had more mwh available for resale primarily due to increased output from vermont yankee and millstone  as neither plant was off line for scheduled refueling and maintenance in also  vermont yankee had a second quarter unscheduled outage for fuel rod repairs 
other operating revenue increased about million 
purchased power most of our power purchases are made under long term contracts 
these contracts  power supply management and nuclear investments are described in more detail in power supply matters below 
the primary components of purchased power expense are as follows in thousands for the years ended december vynpc a hydro quebec independent power producers ipps subtotal long term contracts short term purchases miscellaneous purchases sfas no 
loss accrual net of amortizations nuclear decommissioning costs accounting deferrals amortizations b total purchased power a includes about million in and in related to insurance refunds that we deferred per psb approval 
see note summary of significant accounting policies 
b accounting deferrals amortizations are based on permitted regulatory accounting guidance in which certain incurred costs  typically treated as expenses by unregulated entities  are deferred and expensed when recovered in future periods 
such accounting treatment allows for the matching of expenses with revenues over the period of recovery  and for purchased power are typically related to incremental replacement energy costs that result from nuclear plant outages  and for also include items related to sale of the vermont yankee nuclear power plant 
for year over year comparison purposes these items are included in the variance explanations for individual sources as described below 
page of the related mwh purchases and unit price from these sources are summarized below mwh mwh mwh mwh mwh mwh vynpc hydro quebec ipps short term purchases miscellaneous purchases total mwh vs 
purchased power expense increased million  or percent  in compared to as a result of the following factors in the first quarter of  in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded a million pre tax loss accrual related to termination of the power contract with connecticut valley 
the loss accrual represents management s best estimate of the difference between expected future sales revenue  in the wholesale market  for the purchased power that was formerly sold to connecticut valley and the cost of purchased power to be incurred to realize those future sales 
in accordance with gaap  the loss accrual is being amortized on a straight line basis through  which represents the estimated life of our power contracts that were in place to source the connecticut valley power contract 
in  amortizations reduced purchased power expense by million  for a net impact of million 
short term purchases  which include purchases from iso new england and third parties in new england  increased million primarily due to replacement energy for the millstone unit refueling outage and the vermont yankee outages 
we deferred about million for incremental replacement energy costs related to the millstone unit refueling outage and vermont yankee unscheduled outage  compared to million of amortizations of replacement energy deferrals related to a millstone unit refueling outage 
these deferrals and amortizations are included in accounting deferrals amortizations in the table above 
ipp purchases increased million  primarily due to higher output from these facilities and higher rates 
the majority of ipps are hydro facilities and output is based on weather conditions that affect water flow 
nuclear decommissioning costs are related to our share of maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic decommissioning costs 
our share of decommissioning costs increased million  due to changes in ferc approved rates in the amounts in the table above are reflected net of accounting deferrals  which are described in more detail in power supply matters nuclear generating companies below 
vermont yankee purchases decreased million  excluding a refund 
about million of the decrease is primarily due to a scheduled refueling outage and a day unscheduled outage in versus no plant outages in also in  vermont yankee received a refund related to defective fuel rods that caused an unscheduled outage in for accounting purposes our share of the refund  about million  was used to decrease deferred charges related to incremental replacement energy costs resulting from the outage 
the refund is included in vermont yankee purchases  while the offset is included in accounting deferrals amortizations in the table above 
hydro quebec purchases decreased million due to fewer deliveries under the hydro quebec contract resulting from interconnection deficiencies 
vs 
purchased power expense increased million  or percent  in compared to as a result of the following factors an million increase in vermont yankee related costs primarily resulting from higher plant output in  which increased purchases by about million 
other factors that resulted in a net million increase when comparing versus included a million reduction in power costs due to state tax benefits realized by vermont yankee that were passed on to the vermont yankee sponsors and million of sale related deferrals in  offset by about million due to elimination of amortizations for vermont yankee nuclear refueling outages 
a million increase in purchases from ipps due to higher volume and rates 
a million decrease in purchases from hydro quebec due to reduced deliveries resulting from interconnection deficiencies 
a million decrease in short term purchases  including the impacts of accounting deferrals and amortizations of replacement energy costs in and the variance when comparing versus is attributed to the following factors a million increase in iso new england capacity charges due to credits we received in for our share of revenues from the iso new england capacity deficiency pool  with no comparable credits in  a million decrease in short term and spot energy purchases  a million decrease in installed capacity purchases due to lower rate and volume  and a million decrease in other costs 
page of operating expenses operating expenses represent costs incurred to support our core business

over under over under amount percent amount percent operation purchased power explained above production and transmission other operation maintenance depreciation other taxes  principally property taxes taxes on income total operating expenses production and transmission these expenses are primarily associated with generating electricity from our wholly and jointly owned units  and transmission of electricity 
the million decrease in is primarily due to lower output from jointly owned units and lower transmission costs 
other operation these expenses are primarily related to operating activity such as customer accounting  customer service  administrative and general and other operating costs incurred to support our core business 
the million increase includes about million related to reducing the vermont utility s earnings to achieve an percent return on equity 
in  based on a psb approved accounting order  this amounted to a million pre tax expense 
in  per the july psb approved rate order  this amounted to a million pre tax expense 
in both years  we recorded related regulatory liabilities for these amounts 
see vermont retail rates discussion above for additional information 
the remaining million increase resulted from higher employee related costs pension and medical  higher pole attachment expenses that are offset in operating revenue above  higher professional services costs related to sarbanes oxley project readiness  the rate case and general legal expenses  and higher bad debt expense related to a second quarter customer bankruptcy 
these increased costs are partially offset by the favorable impact of an insurance settlement received in the second quarter of and the favorable impact of conservation and load management amortizations that ended in the million increase for versus is primarily related to the vermont utility s mandated earnings cap  which resulted in a pre tax expense of million in to achieve the mandated earnings cap 
other factors affecting versus included a million reversal of environmental reserves in  which results in an unfavorable variance when comparing versus  and higher employee related costs  offset by internal cost cutting efforts  and lower bad debt reserve adjustments in compared to due to several customer bankruptcies in maintenance these expenses are primarily related to costs associated with maintaining our electric distribution system 
there was no significant variance for versus or for versus depreciation we use the straight line remaining life method of depreciation 
there was no significant variance for versus or for versus other taxes  principally property taxes this is primarily related to property taxes and payroll taxes 
there was no significant variance for versus or for versus taxes on income federal and state income taxes fluctuate with the level of pre tax earnings in relation to permanent differences and changes in valuation allowances for the periods 
the effective tax rate was percent for  percent for and percent for the effective tax rate decreased significantly in primarily due to tax benefits associated with the sale of certain of catamount s equity investments in the effective tax rate for decreased when compared to primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance 
see income tax matters below and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to income taxes 
page of during  we received three income tax refunds totaling million exclusive of interest 
one refund related to an appeal of an overpayment from a prior federal income tax audit for the tax years through the proceeds from the settlement included a federal income tax refund of million 
the other two refunds related to an appeal of federal and state income tax overpayments for the proceeds from the settlements included a federal income tax refund of million and a state refund of million 
we also decreased the estimate for tax contingencies by million due to a reduction in potential tax liabilities 
on june   the state of vermont enacted legislation that reduced the state income tax rate from percent to percent effective january   and from percent to percent effective january  deferred tax assets and liabilities were adjusted in to reflect the enacted income tax rate change 
this rate change reduced regulatory tax assets by about million  and increased income tax expense by about million 
the decrease in regulatory assets was primarily caused by a decrease in operating deferred tax liabilities 
the increase in tax expense was primarily caused by a reduction in non operating deferred tax assets 
in  taxes on income also included a million benefit related to the loss accrual resulting from the termination of the power contract with connecticut valley as described in discontinued operations above 
other income and deductions these items are related to the non operating activities of the utility business and the operating and non operating activities of our non regulated businesses 
the following table provides the variances in income statement line items for other income and deductions on the consolidated statements of income for the past two years dollars in thousands 
over under over under amount percent amount percent equity in earnings of affiliates equity in earnings of non utility investments gain on sale of non utility investments allowance for equity funds during construction other income other deductions benefit provision for income taxes total other income and deductions equity in earnings of affiliates these are related to our equity investments  primarily velco and vynpc 
the million decrease is primarily related to lower vynpc interest income 
vynpc s interest income was higher in due to sale proceeds that were not disbursed until october the million decrease for versus was primarily related to state tax benefits realized by vermont yankee in as a result of the sale of the plant 
these tax benefits were passed through to the plant owners  partly in the form of higher equity in earnings  with the remaining through lower purchased power expense 
the july sale of the vermont yankee plant has reduced our ongoing equity in earnings from that investment 
equity in earnings of non utility investments these are related to catamount s equity investments in non regulated independent power projects 
the million decrease is primarily due to lower earnings from its investments in glenns ferry  rupert  rumford and catamount energy limited 
the million decrease for versus was primarily due to the october sale of its heartlands investments  lower earnings from its rumford investment due to an accelerated depreciation adjustment and lower earnings from its investments in appomattox and ryegate 
see diversification below 
gain on sale of non utility investments in  catamount completed the sale of its glenns ferry and rupert investments and the sale of its fibrothetford note receivable and equity investment 
these asset sales amounted to a pre tax gain of about million in there were no asset sales in  and in asset sales approximated book value  therefore there were no associated gains or losses 
see diversification below 
allowance for equity funds used during construction this is the cost of equity financing during construction projects 
it is capitalized as part of major utility plant projects when costs applicable to such construction work in progress have not been included in rate base through ratemaking proceedings 
page of other income these income items include interest and dividend income  interest on temporary investments and non utility notes receivable  catamount s operating revenue  regulatory asset carrying costs  amortization of contributions in aid of construction and various miscellaneous other income items 
the million increase is primarily due to higher interest income on temporary investments and available for sale securities  resulting from investment of cash proceeds from the connecticut valley sale and other cash on hand in early other factors include higher interest and dividend income primarily related to interest received as part of an irs tax settlement and higher non utility revenue due to fees associated with catamount s united kingdom development efforts  offset by lower miscellaneous other income 
the million increase for versus is primarily related to higher interest on non utility notes receivable  higher non operating rental income  higher regulatory asset carrying costs and higher miscellaneous other income  offset by lower non utility revenue due to realized development revenue in upon the sale of one of catamount s investments 
other deductions these deductions include catamount s operating expenses  asset impairment charges  supplemental retirement benefits and insurance  including changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies  and miscellaneous other deductions 
the million decrease in is primarily related to lower catamount operating expenses due to lower business development and other consulting expenses 
business development expenses were lower as a result of entering into development arrangements with third parties in other consulting expenses were lower primarily due to the expensing in of previously capitalized costs related to the private equity placement efforts 
the million decrease for versus was primarily related to lower life insurance expense resulting from a significant increase in the cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies due to financial market results  and various one time items in  which result in a favorable variance when comparing versus these one time items included million pre tax asset impairment charges in related to catamount s investments that were sold in the fourth quarter of  a one time payment of million to the non vermont owners related to closing the vermont yankee sale  and lower eversant operating expense due to discontinuance of its efforts to pursue unregulated business opportunities 
benefit provision for income taxes federal and state income taxes fluctuate with the level of pre tax earnings in relation to permanent differences and changes in valuation allowances for the periods 
the increase for is primarily due to higher catamount earnings related to the sales of investment interests 
in the third quarter of there was also a million reduction in income tax valuation allowances associated with previously recorded equity losses from asset impairments 
in  the consolidated federal income tax provision reflected a benefit due to realization of capital gains on the connecticut valley sale  which afforded catamount the opportunity to reduce tax valuation allowances 
also see income tax matters below 
interest expense interest expense includes interest on long term debt and other interest of the utility business and our unregulated businesses  and allowance for borrowed funds during construction 
the following table provides the variances in income statement line items for interest expense on the consolidated statements of income for the past two years dollars in thousands 
over under over under amount percent amount percent interest on long term debt other interest allowance for borrowed funds during construction total interest expense interest on long term debt the million decrease in includes million resulting from lower long term debt and million resulting from lower interest rates due to the august bond refinancing 
the million decrease for versus is primarily related to lower long term debt 
see financing above for additional information 
page of other interest expense the million increase is primarily related to the reclassification of dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to interest expense as described in dividends on preferred stock below  and increased carrying costs on regulatory liabilities 
this was partially offset by the irs tax settlement described above 
the million decrease for versus is primarily related to eversant s settlement of an irs audit resulting in the reversal of a related interest expense accrual previously recorded in the fourth quarter of allowance for borrowed funds during construction this is the cost of debt financing during construction projects that we capitalize as part of the cost of major utility plant projects when costs applicable to such construction work in progress have not been included in rate base through the ratemaking process 
there was no significant variance in these expenses for versus or versus discontinued operations on january   connecticut valley completed the sale of substantially all of its plant assets and its franchise to psnh 
see discussion of discontinued operations above 
dividends on preferred stock preferred stock dividends decreased by million in primarily related to sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with the characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

this statement established standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
we implemented the income statement impacts of sfas no 
in  and as a result about million of dividends on the percent series mandatorily redeemable preferred stock were reclassified from preferred stock dividend requirements to interest expense 
power supply matters sources of energy our power supply portfolio includes a mix of base load  dispatchable and energy constrained schedulable resources 
a breakdown of energy sources is shown below nuclear generating companies canadian hydro contract company owned hydro and thermal jointly owned units independent power producers other our joint ownership interests include percent in unit of the millstone nuclear power station  percent in joseph c 
mcneil  a mw wood  gas and oil fired unit  and percent joint ownership in wyman  a mw oil fired unit 
our wholly owned units include hydroelectric generating units  two oil fired gas turbines and one diesel peaking unit with a combined nameplate capability of mw 
we have a long term power contract with hydro quebec and a long term power contract for purchase of about percent of vermont yankee plant output 
combined  these contracts contributed about percent of our total energy mwh purchases in  compared to percent in and percent in we are also required to purchase power from various independent power producers ipps under long term contracts 
these contracts are discussed in more detail below 
power contract commitments hydro quebec we purchase varying amounts of power from hydro quebec under the vermont joint owners vjo power contract and related contracts negotiated between us and hydro quebec that altered the terms and conditions of the original contract by reducing the overall power requirements and related costs 
our purchases under these contracts extend through there are specific contractual provisions that provide that in the event any vjo member fails to meet its obligation under the contract with hydro quebec  the remaining vjo participants  including the company  must step up to the defaulting party s share on a pro rata basis 
as of december   our obligation is about percent of the total vjo power contract  which translates to about million  on a nominal basis  over the contract term 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this contract 
page of in january  hydro quebec notified the vjo that  due to interconnection deficiencies  it would not be able to reschedule energy not delivered during the and contract years 
we continue to work with hydro quebec to minimize future interconnection deficiencies through various scheduling modifications and use of interconnection facilities 
our estimated cost of energy and capacity under the existing contracts with hydro quebec are million in  million in  million in  million in and million in vynpc we have a percent entitlement in vermont yankee plant output sold by entergy envy to vynpc  through a long term power purchase contract with vynpc 
one remaining secondary purchaser continues to receive a small percentage of our entitlement  reducing our entitlement to about percent 
the long term contracts between vynpc and the entitlement holders and between vynpc and envy became effective on july   the same day that the vermont yankee nuclear plant was sold to envy 
we no longer bear the operating costs and risks associated with running the plant or the costs and risks associated with the eventual decommissioning of the plant 
envy has no obligation to supply energy to vynpc over the amount the plant is producing  so entitlement holders receive reduced amounts when the plant is operating at a reduced level  and no energy when the plant is not operating 
the ppa through which vynpc purchases power from envy and in turn sells to its sponsors includes prices that range from cents to cents per kilowatt hour through march effective november  the contract prices are subject to a low market adjuster that protects us and our power consumers if power market prices drop significantly 
the low market adjuster is a mechanism in which the ppa base contract price for each billing month is compared to a month average ending in same billing month of hourly market prices as defined in the ppa 
if the month average market price is less than percent of the base ppa contract price  then percent of the month average market price will be used for the billing month 
the low market adjusted price cannot exceed the base ppa contract price 
if the market prices rise  however  contract prices are not adjusted upward 
in addition to ppa charges  vynpc s billings to the sponsors include certain of its residual costs of service through a ferc tariff to the vynpc sponsors 
the ppa is expected to result in decreased costs over the life of the ppa when compared to the projected cost of continued ownership of the plant 
purchases from vynpc amounted to about million in  million in and million in  and are included in purchased power on the consolidated statements of income 
accounts payable to vynpc amounted to million at december  and million at december  future vynpc purchases are expected to be million in  million in  million in  million in and million in in  envy sought psb approval to increase generation at the vermont yankee plant by megawatts 
our purchases from vynpc will not be affected by increased generation but our entitlement percentage of plant output will decrease about percent 
on march   the psb approved the proposal  but its approval was conditioned on envy providing an outage protection indemnification ratepayer protection proposal or rpp for us and gmp in case the uprate causes temporary reductions in output that reduce our value of the ppa 
our maximum right to indemnification under the rpp is about million  and will be in place for three years to cover any uprate related reductions in output 
plant output has been reduced since the april scheduled refueling outage  and will continue until envy receives nrc approval for the uprate 
our mw entitlement was reduced by an average of about mw during this period 
the financial effect of such a reduction will be covered under the terms of the rpp 
in  envy made a payment of an undisputed amount under the rpp and we are seeking agreement with envy on a final payment 
on june   an incident that caused a fire at the vermont yankee plant s transformer caused the plant to shut down for about days 
we deferred about million of incremental replacement energy costs incurred as a result of the outage  per the psb s preliminary approval of our request for an accounting order 
the final accounting order is being addressed as part of our rate case 
we believe the plant went off line due to problems associated with uprate related improvements made by envy  and have sought about million from envy to cover the incremental replacement energy costs resulting from the outage 
envy contends that the problem would have occurred regardless of the uprate 
we engaged in discussions with envy relating to settlement of this dispute in accordance with the rpp 
having failed to reach a settlement with envy  we petitioned the psb for resolution 
on february   the psb held a prehearing conference and set a schedule that provides for resolution in the third qua rter of we and envy agreed to remain in settlement discussions relating to this matter 
in april  in response to an nrc inspection conducted during the vermont yankee plant s scheduled refueling outage  envy reported that two short spent fuel rod segments were not in what envy believed to be their documented location in the spent fuel pool 
according to envy  in the rods were placed in a special stainless steel container in the spent fuel page of pool 
after initial document review and visual inspection of the spent fuel pool  envy did not locate the fuel rod segments 
on may   envy notified vynpc that based on the terms of the purchase and sale agreement dated august   and facts at the time  it was their view that costs associated with the spent fuel rod segment inspection effort were the responsibility of vynpc 
on may   vynpc responded that based on the information at the time there was no basis for envy s claim 
subsequently  envy s continuing documentation review led to the discovery of the fuel rod segments in a container in the spent fuel pool 
the nrc has begun its own investigation into envy s accounting for these segments 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time 
nuclear industry practice typically is to maintain the capacity to off load the entire active nuclear fuel core into the spent fuel pool as a safety measure  this is called maintaining full core discharge capability 
envy anticipated that to maintain full core discharge capability  dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel will be needed at the vermont yankee plant by late based on current operations or as early as if the nrc does grant permission to uprate the plant output 
envy requires enabling legislation from the vermont state legislature and psb approval for dry cask storage 
independent power producers ipps we purchase power from a number of ipps who own qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of these qualifying facilities produce energy primarily using hydroelectric and biomass generation 
most of the power comes through a state appointed purchasing agent  vepp inc veppi  which assigns power to all vermont utilities under psb rules 
in  ipp purchases accounted for percent of the company s total mwh purchased and percent of purchased power expense 
purchases from ipps are expected to be million in  million in  million in  million in and million in these amounts reflect annual savings of about million related to the ipp settlement that is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
power supply management we engage in short term purchases and sales in the wholesale markets administered by the new england independent system operator iso new england and with other third parties  primarily in new england  to minimize net power costs and risks to our customers 
we enter into forward purchase contracts when additional supply is needed  such as for a vermont yankee nuclear plant refueling outage 
we enter into forward sale contracts when we forecast excess supply and to minimize the net cost and risks of serving customers 
on an hourly basis  power is sold or bought through iso new england to balance our resource output and load requirements  through the normal settlement process 
on a monthly basis  we aggregate the hourly sales and purchases through iso new england and record them as operating revenue or purchased power  respectively 
our long term power forecast shows that energy purchase and production amounts exceed our load requirements 
this is partly attributed to the january  termination of the power contract with connecticut valley  which made an annual average of about mw previously used to source the contract available for load requirements or for resale 
because of this general increase  in november  we entered two separate forward sale transactions  one through october and one through december both contracts require physical delivery of power  but one is contingent upon vermont yankee plant output 
we have assessed these two forward sale contracts and determined that one is a derivative under sfas no 
 and the other  due to the unit contingent nature of the transaction  is not a derivative 
our accounting for derivative power contracts is described in more detail in critical accounting policies and estimates above 
based on existing commitments and contracts  we expect that net purchased power and production fuel costs will average about million to million per year for the years through these projections are dependent  in part  upon wholesale power market prices 
increases in the wholesale price should generally reduce our net power costs  while decreases should generally increase net costs 
we continue to monitor  and adapt to  changes to new england wholesale power markets and open access transmission systems 
in march  iso new england implemented standard market design smd  a significant step to restructuring the wholesale energy markets in the northeast 
we use both the day ahead and real time markets in iso new england 
the day ahead energy market has generally seen slightly higher energy prices and lower price volatility than the real time energy market 
operating reserve prices and their volatility have also generally been lower in the day ahead market 
we apply continuous improvement management techniques in managing our power supply resources and load obligations in smd to minimize the net cost of power supply and related risks 
page of beginning may   we began to settle our power accounts with iso new england on a standalone direct basis 
up until this time  all vermont utilities were settled at iso new england  and velco then performed the settlement within vermont 
with changes in power markets and nepool iso rules and procedures  many of the benefits of a single vermont settlement have disappeared  and direct settlement now provides advantages to us in terms of efficiency and cost savings 
transmission related matters we operate our transmission system under an open access tariff  pursuant to ferc order no 
in  ferc began work to amend regulations and facilitate formation of regional transmission organizations rtos  and in  ferc issued order no 
for that purpose 
since that time  we have participated in numerous related proceedings  including discussions to create an open access transmission tariff and transmission owners agreement to govern the provision of transmission services 
in july  ferc issued a standard market design notice of proposed rulemaking to establish nationwide rules for power markets and rtos 
the rulemaking was designed to separate governance and operation of the transmission system from generation companies and other market participants and facilitate power markets with common rules 
on october   iso new england and the transmission owning entities in new england  including us  filed a joint proposal with ferc to create an rto for new england 
that filing received conditional approval from ferc  and the rto parties have reached agreement in principle to resolve certain outstanding issues with nepool 
the parties have requested that ferc expedite its decision processes on remaining issues  in particular  the rate of return that will be permitted on transmission investments 
on march   ferc conditionally approved the rto filing 
the rto parties submitted a compliance filing to ferc in december in the filing  the highgate facilities are classified as ptf with a five year phase in of regional network service rns reimbursement treatment 
at the end of the phase in period  our net costs will be based on our load ratio rather than our ownership share of the facilities 
this change is expected to significantly decrease our costs for rns service related to that facility 
apart from the new rto  we expect other transmission costs will increase due to growth in new transmission facilities in new england 
the rto began operations on february  our share of savings related to the highgate facilities are expected to be about million in  million in  million in  million in and million in at this time  we are not able to predict the impact of other transmission costs related to the rto 
transmission plays a significant role in the competitive wholesale market 
at this time  much of the cost of new england s existing and new high voltage transmission system kv looped facilities is shared by all new england utilities 
velco is planning several significant upgrades  which have been approved by nepool for shared cost treatment 
vermont has traditionally had higher than average transmission costs 
the current approach provides cost and reliability benefits in providing service to our customers  because our load share is a small fraction of new england s load  and the facilities upgrades velco is planning improve the reliability and efficiency of the transmission network 
we will pay a share of such projects elsewhere in new england  but the net economic effect is expected to be beneficial 
also  better reliability elsewhere in the region benefits vermont s reliability because of the highly integrated nature of new england s high voltage network 
if other future transmission facil ities do not qualify for cost sharing  those costs will be charged only to the requesting entity and our share of such costs will be affected by ferc approved cost allocation rules contained in velco s and our tariffs and agreements 
velco bills us on a monthly basis for transmission and administrative costs associated with power and transmission services  these billings include various credits such as those from iso new england under the nepool open access transmission tariff noatt 
such billings amounted to million in  million in and million in  and are reflected as production and transmission expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
prior to may  velco also billed us for our share of noatt charges  which are now billed directly to us from iso new england 
of the amounts billed to us by velco  about million in  million in and million in are included in velco s revenues 
accounts payable to velco amounted to million at december  and million at december  wholly owned generating units we own and operate hydroelectric generating units  two oil fired gas turbines and one diesel peaking unit with a combined nameplate capability of mw 
we are in the process of relicensing or preparing to license six separate hydroelectric projects under the federal power act 
these projects  some of which are grouped together under a single license  represent about mw  or percent  of our page of total hydroelectric nameplate capacity 
the ferc is expected to impose conditions designed to address impacts on fish and the environment 
we cannot predict the specific impact of any conditions  but capital expenditures and operating costs are expected to increase in the short term and net generation from these projects will likely decrease 
peterson dam in january  we  the vermont agency of natural resources agency  vermont natural resources council and other parties reached an agreement to allow us to relicense the four dams we own and operate on the lamoille river 
according to the agreement  we will receive a water quality certificate from the state  which is needed for ferc to relicense the facilities for years 
the agreement also stipulates that subject to various conditions  we must begin decommissioning peterson dam in about years 
the agreement requires psb approval of full rate recovery related to decommissioning the peterson dam  including recovery of replacement power costs when the dam is out of service 
in july  the agency published its draft water quality certificate and in october  pursuant to the schedule set forth in the agreement  we filed a petition with the psb for approval of the rate recovery mechanisms 
in april  the psb issued an order adopting a schedule intended to permit a final order in the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  at a public hearing  many residents of the town of milton opposed the dam s removal 
the psb held two additional public meetings in september  and testimony was given in support of and opposition to removal of the power station 
the case has continued to progress through the regulatory process  with some delay  and final technical hearings are now scheduled for march and april a final order is now expected in we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
nuclear generating companies we are one of several sponsor companies with ownership interests in maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic  and are responsible for paying our ownership percentage of decommissioning and all other costs for each plant 
we also have a percent joint ownership interest in millstone unit our obligations related to that plant are described in more detail in note commitments and contingencies 
the maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic nuclear plants have been shut down and are undergoing decommissioning 
information related to decommissioning and closure costs  including our share of estimated future payments for each plant  are as follows dollars in millions date of study total expenditures a remaining obligation b revenue requirements c company share d maine yankee connecticut yankee yankee atomic a total cumulative decommissioning expenditures incurred through  net of proceeds received from various legal matters settled prior to december  b estimated remaining decommissioning costs in dollars for the period through for maine yankee and connecticut yankee and through for yankee atomic 
c estimated future payments required by sponsor companies to recover estimated decommissioning and all other costs for and forward  in nominal dollars 
for maine yankee and connecticut yankee includes collections for required contributions to spent fuel funds as described below 
yankee atomic has already collected and paid these required contributions 
d represents our share of revenue requirements based on ownership percentage in each plant 
maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic are seeking recovery of fuel storage related costs stemming from the default of the united states department of energy doe under the fuel disposal contracts that were mandated by the united states congress under the high level waste act 
all three are parties to a lawsuit against the doe seeking damages based on the doe s default 
the trial on determination of damages began on july and ended august  closing arguments were held in january and final post trial briefs were filed in february a decision is expected by the end of  however  an appeal by at least one of the parties is likely 
none of the plants have included any allowance for potential recovery of these claims in their ferc filed cost estimates 
our share of maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic estimated costs are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as regulatory assets or other deferred charges  and nuclear decommissioning liabilities current and non current 
these amounts are adjusted when revised estimates are provided by the companies 
at december   we had regulatory assets of about million related to maine yankee and million related to connecticut yankee 
these estimated costs are being collected from our customers through existing retail rate tariffs 
at december   we also had other deferred charges related to incremental dismantling costs of about million for connecticut yankee and page of million for yankee atomic 
these amounts include payments of about million to connecticut yankee and million to yankee atomic  representing our share of the respective companies collection of incremental costs as of december  these incremental dismantling costs are not being recovered through existing retail rate tariffs  and are being deferred based on an october psb approved accounting order for treatment of these incremental costs as deferred charges  to be addressed in our pending rate proceeding 
maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic collect decommissioning and closure costs through wholesale ferc approved rates charged under power agreements with several new england utilities  including us 
historically  our share of these costs has been recovered from retail customers through psb approved rates 
based on the regulatory process  management believes its share of decommissioning and closure costs for each plant will continue to be recovered through the regulatory process 
although management believes that the decommissioning and closure costs will ultimately be recovered from its customers  there is a risk that the ferc may not allow full recovery of connecticut yankee s incremental increased costs in wholesale rates 
if ferc does not allow these costs to be recovered in wholesale rates  we anticipate that the psb would disallow these costs for recovery in retail rates as well 
see discussion below for additional information related to maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee a tomic 
maine yankee we have a percent ownership interest in maine yankee 
billings from maine yankee amounted to about million in  million in and million in  and are included in purchased power on the consolidated statements of income 
accounts payable to maine yankee for and were of a nominal amount 
in october  maine yankee filed a ferc rate proceeding for collection of estimated decommissioning and long term spent fuel storage costs 
in july  maine yankee and various other parties agreed to an offer of settlement resolving all issues raised by the rate case participants 
on september   ferc approved the settlement  which provides for recovery of all of maine yankee s forecasted costs of providing service through a formula rate contained in its power contracts through october  and replenishment of the doe spent fuel obligation through collections from november through october from january through october   maine yankee s billings to sponsor companies were based on its ferc filing subject to refund 
beginning november   maine yankee s billings have been based on the ferc approved settlement  reduced for excess collections that occurred prior to the effective date 
connecticut yankee we have a percent ownership interest in connecticut yankee 
billings from connecticut yankee amounted to million for  million for and million for  and are included in purchased power on the consolidated statements of income 
accounts payable to connecticut yankee for and were of a nominal amount 
costs currently billed by connecticut yankee are based on its most recent ferc filed rates  which became effective february   for collection through  subject to refund  and pending a final order by ferc 
prior to february   costs were billed by connecticut yankee based on its ferc approved rates that became effective september   for collection through connecticut yankee is currently involved in litigation related to a contract dispute 
also in  connecticut yankee filed a rate application with ferc 
these matters are discussed in more detail below 
bechtel litigation connecticut yankee is involved in a contract dispute with bechtel power corporation bechtel  which resulted in termination of the decommissioning services contract between connecticut yankee and bechtel 
the lawsuit has been assigned to the complex litigation docket and has been set for a jury trial beginning may  connecticut yankee also notified bechtel s surety of its intention to file a claim under the performance bond 
on june   bechtel filed a pre judgment remedy application pjr requesting a million garnishment of the decommissioning trust trust  connecticut yankee shareholder payments to the trust and any proceeds from the fuel disposal contract litigation pending between connecticut yankee and the doe  as well as attachment of any connecticut yankee assets  including the haddam neck real property 
on july   connecticut yankee filed its objection to the pjr 
on july   the court allowed the connecticut department of public utility control ct dpuc to intervene in the pjr proceeding for the limited purpose of objecting to bechtel s requested garnishment of the trust and related payments 
the court held hearings on these matters in august and october on october   bechtel and connecticut yankee entered into an agreement that made additional hearings unnecessary 
bechtel agreed to withdraw its request for an attachment of the decommissioning trust fund and related p ayments  in return for potential attachment of connecticut yankee s real property in connecticut with a book value of million and the page of escrowing of million the sponsors are scheduled to pay to connecticut yankee through june  this agreement is subject to approval of the court and would not be implemented until the court found that such assets were subject to attachment 
connecticut yankee intends to contest the attachability of such assets 
the agreement does not materially change the legal positions in this litigation 
the ct dpuc did not object to the agreement 
ferc rate case filing in december  connecticut yankee s board of directors endorsed an updated estimate estimate of the costs for the plant s decommissioning project 
this updated estimate reflects the fact that connecticut yankee is now directly managing the work self performing to complete decommissioning of the plant following the default termination of bechtel 
the estimate of approximately million covers the time period and represents an aggregate increase of approximately million in dollars over the costs estimate in its ferc rate case settlement  which covered the same time period 
the new cost estimate includes the cost of providing service under the formula rate contained in its ferc tariff  including decommissioning costs  as well as the replenishment of the spent fuel trust fund  which has been combined with the decommissioning trust fund 
on june   the ct dpuc and the occ filed a petition petition with ferc seeking a declaratory order that connecticut yankee can recover all decommissioning costs from its sponsor companies  but that those purchasers may not recover in their retail rates any costs that ferc might determine to be imprudently incurred 
connecticut yankee and its sponsor companies  including the company  have responded in opposition to the petition  indicating that the order sought by the ct dpuc would violate the federal power act and decisions of the united states supreme court  other federal and state courts  and ferc 
the nhpuc filed an intervention notice in support of the petition 
bechtel has filed an amicus brief and intervention notice in support of the petition 
on july   connecticut yankee filed the estimate with the ferc as part of its rate application filing seeking additional funding to complete the decommissioning project and for storage of spent fuel through the filing requested that new rates become effective january  the filing includes proposed increased decommissioning charges  based on the estimate  as well as new annual charges for pension expense and costs of funding post employment benefits other than pensions 
the proposed annual decommissioning collection represents a significant increase in annual charges to the sponsor companies  including us  as compared to the existing ferc rates 
on july   ferc issued a notice of the filing indicating that intervention and protest filings would be due by july  however  that date was extended to july  at the request of the ct dpuc 
four non utility interventions have been filed at the ferc by the ct dpuc  the connecticut office of consumer counsel occ  bechtel and the massachusetts attorney general 
on august   ferc issued an order accepting for filing the new charges proposed by connecticut yankee  suspending these revised charges until february   establishing administrative law judge hearing procedures and schedules  denying the request of the ct dpuc and occ for both an accelerated hearing schedule and for a bond or other security for potential refunds  denying the declaratory ruling sought by the ct dpuc and occ  and granting motions to intervene for bechtel and other applying parties 
on september   a ferc administrative law judge was appointed to the case 
on february   the ct dpuc filed testimony with ferc 
in its filed testimony  the ct dpuc argues that about million to million of connecticut yankee s requested increase is due to connecticut yankee s imprudence in managing the decommissioning project while bechtel was the contractor 
therefore  the ct dpuc recommends a total disallowance of million to million 
the current schedule provides for the hearings to start june  connecticut yankee anticipates that the process of resolving the matters in the filing is likely to be contentious and lengthy 
our estimated aggregate obligation related to connecticut yankee is about million 
we continue to believe that ferc will approve recovery of these increased costs in wholesale rates based on the nature of costs and previous rulings at other nuclear companies 
once approved by ferc  we believe it is unlikely that the psb would not allow these ferc approved costs to be recovered in retail rates 
if ferc adopts the ct dpuc s recommendations described above  our share of the proposed disallowance would be about million 
the timing  amount and outcome of the bechtel litigation and ferc rate case filing cannot be predicted at this time 
yankee atomic we have a percent ownership interest in yankee atomic 
billings from yankee atomic amounted to million for and million for  and are included in purchased power on the consolidated statements of page of income 
accounts payable to yankee atomic for and were of a nominal amount 
billings from yankee atomic ended in july based on yankee atomic s determination that it had collected sufficient funds to complete the decommissioning effort 
we are not currently collecting yankee atomic costs in retail rates 
in april  yankee atomic filed with ferc  based on updated cost estimates  for new rates to collect these costs from sponsor companies 
ferc approved the resumption of billings starting june for a recovery period through  subject to refund 
on august   yankee atomic filed a settlement agreement that resolved all issues raised by the parties 
beginning april and each year following  the new rates are subject to an annual adjustment based on the prior calendar year s data if the decommissioning trust fund market performance is percent greater or percent less than the assumptions used to calculate the schedule of decommissioning charges 
as such  a reduction was applied to filed rates beginning with april billings
