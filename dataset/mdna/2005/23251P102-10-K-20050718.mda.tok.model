this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about our industry and us 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described under the heading factors affecting future operating results and in the business section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
management s discussion and analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures enabling investors and other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations 
the consolidated financial statements  excluding the related notes  include the statements of consolidated operations  consolidated balance sheets  statements of consolidated shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss and statements of consolidated cash flows 
the notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements and provide additional information required to fully understand the nature of amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
business overview we are a neuromodulation company founded to design  develop and bring to market medical devices which provide a unique therapy  vns  for the treatment of epilepsy  treatment resistant depression and other debilitating neurological  psychiatric diseases and other disorders 
vns therapy is currently approved for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in patients with partial onset seizures that are refractory or resistant to antiepileptic drugs and as a long term adjunctive treatment for patients years of age or older with chronic or recurrent treatment resistant depression in a major depressive episode that has not responded to at least four adequate antidepressant treatments 
product sales to date have been primarily from sales in the epilepsy market 
on july  fda approved vns therapy as a long term adjunctive treatment for patients years of age or older with chronic or recurrent treatment resistant depression 
since february  we have been preparing our organization for approval and launch in depression and we have recently expanded our organization from approximately to personnel  primarily in the areas of sales  case management  clinical engineering and surgical support staff  to create the organizational capacity necessary to support anticipated market demand for vns therapy in the epilepsy and depression markets 
while we anticipate significant increases in revenues in fiscal related to sales of vns therapy in the us for trd  and we believe that we have created adequate organizational capacity to support our expanded business requirements  the scale up of our organization is substantial 
we expect quarterly operating expenses to increase significantly and in advance of anticipated increases in quarterly revenues 
furthermore  our expectations for market acceptance in a completely new device market for trd will likely change as we complete our product launch in trd and promote awareness and acceptance of vns therapy among new psychiatric prescribers 
accordingly  while we expect to achieve revenue growth as a result of this approval  we can provide no assurance as to the size or timing of such growth  particularly  because fda s approval was so recently received 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities that include product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities  manufacturing start up costs and systems infrastructure 
we have also made significant investments in recent periods in connection with sales and marketing activities in the us and clinical research costs associated with new indications development  most notably depression 
for the period from inception through april   we incurred a cumulative net deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate significant investments in sales and marketing expenses associated with a planned product launch and start up in depression as well as increasing investments in post approval and pre approval clinical studies 
table of contents in epilepsy  depression and other new indications 
excluding epilepsy and depression studies  clinical studies are for investigational therapies subject to fda approval 
the primary exchange rate movements that impact our consolidated net sales growth include the us dollar as compared to the euro 
the weakening of the us dollar in fiscal generally has a favorable impact on our sales for the year 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting foreign currency impact on operating costs and expenses 
critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies as the most critical because  in management s view  they are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results and most demanding in terms of requiring estimates and other exercises of judgment 
accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer risks and a general provision based upon historical trends 
an increase in losses beyond that expected by management or that historically have been experienced by us would reduce earnings when they become known 
inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost  first in  first out fifo method  or market 
cost includes the acquisition cost of raw materials and components  direct labor and overhead 
management considers potential obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
an acceleration of obsolescence could occur if consumer demand should differ from expectations 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred  significant renewals  improvements and expansions are capitalized 
for financial reporting purposes  we compute depreciation using the straight line method over useful lives ranging from two to nine years 
an unanticipated change in the utilization or expected useful life of property and equipment could result in acceleration in the timing of the expenses 
revenue recognition 
we sell our products through a combination of a direct sales force in the us and certain european countries and through distributors elsewhere 
cyberonics recognizes revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to customers  providing there are no remaining performance obligations required of cyberonics or any matters requiring customer acceptance 
we record estimated sales returns and discounts as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
our revenues are dependent upon sales to new and existing customers pursuant to our current policies 
changes in these policies or sales terms could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we have entered into contractual obligations for the conduct of clinical studies 
costs are incurred primarily at the time of enrollment and paid under the terms of the contracts 
research and development expenses could vary significantly with changes in the timing of clinical activity 
stock options 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standard board sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 
table of contents accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which disclosures are presented in note  summary of significant accounting policies and related data stock options 
because of this election  we continue to account for our employee stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and the related interpretations 
we are required to comply with sfas no 
revised starting on the first day of our fiscal year or april  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
revised will have on cyberonics consolidated operating results and financial condition 
no stock based compensation cost is currently reflected in net income for employee option grants as most options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
there is only one exception further disclosed under note of our consolidated financial statements  whereby deferred compensation is recorded for certain stock based compensation grants based on the excess of the market value of the common stock on the measurement date over the exercise price 
the deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of each unit of stock based compensation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such differences relate primarily to the deductibility of certain accruals and reserves and the effect of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards not yet utilized 
deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on a more likely than not criterion in determining if a valuation allowance should be provided 
results of operations net sales us net sales decreased by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily due to a volume decrease caused by reductions in both replacement and new patient sales  partially offset by an increase of in average selling price due to new product introductions and changes in product mix 
international net sales increased by in fiscal year due to increases in unit sales of and increases in average selling prices of 
the increases in international average selling prices are primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange and changes in product and country mix 
us net sales increased by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily due to an increase of in average system price resulting from new product introductions and changes in product mix 
international net sales increased by in fiscal year due to increases in sales volume and average system price 
sales volume increased by approximately due to increasing demand in europe 
average system price increased primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and changes in product and country mix 
gross profit gross profit decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal year  primarily due to lower sales volumes 
gross profit margin decreased by basis points to due to operational inefficiencies relating to ramp up activities conducted during the first quarter of the fiscal year that negatively impacted gross profit margin by approximately basis points which were offset by improvements in average selling prices and favorable manufacturing variances throughout the remainder of the year which had a favorable impact of approximately basis points 
gross profit increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal year  due to improved sales volumes 
gross profit margin increased by basis points to as a result of sales growth and increases in average selling price which had a favorable impact of basis points and was offset by manufacturing inefficiencies relating to ramp up activities conducted during the last quarter of the fiscal year that negatively impacted gross profit margin by approximately basis points 
cost of sales consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  third party contractor costs  royalties and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
gross margins can be expected to 
table of contents fluctuate in future periods based upon the mix between us and international sales  direct and distributor sales  the vns therapy system selling price  applicable royalty rates and the levels of production volume 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses are comprised of sales  marketing  development  general and administrative activities 
sg a expenses increased by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to additional expenses associated with preparing the organization for a potential us approval and launch in depression 
sg a expenses increased by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to increased expenses associated with market shaping initiatives supporting depression development activities  international operations and expanded corporate administrative functions 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses are comprised of expenses related to our product and process development  product design efforts  clinical trials programs and regulatory activities 
r d expenses increased by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to additional product development programs and expanded regulatory activities 
r d expenses decreased by in fiscal year due to reduced spending in new indications development  primarily in the depression pivotal study costs which were lower in fiscal year  as clinical program costs progressed into the long term  lower cost phase of the d study 
interest income interest income of  during fiscal year increased by as compared to interest income of  for fiscal year  due to higher level of investments and higher interest rates 
interest income for fiscal year was comparable to fiscal year despite greater cash balances in fiscal year as a result of lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense of  for fiscal year decreased primarily due to lower borrowings against the line of credit facility  lower interest rates negotiated during the renewal of the line of credit during the fiscal year 
interest expense of  in fiscal increased primarily due to the expanded use of the line of credit 
the credit facility was increased from million to million in april  and decreased to million in august of the original line of credit facility earned interest at the designated bank rate plus on the greater of million or the average of net balance owed by us at the close of each day during the month 
under the latest amendment  borrowings against the line of credit facility earn the chase bank rate on the greater of million or the average of the net balance owed by us at the close of each day during the month 
other income  net other income  net  primarily includes transaction gains and losses associated with the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

table of contents activities in fiscal was approximately  cash proceeds during the period were primarily used to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
we are party to a number of contracts pursuant to which we are paying for clinical studies for current operating obligations payable totaling million as of april  although we have no firm commitments  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal year  primarily to expand organizational capacity and to enhance business infrastructure and facilities 
the chart below reflects our current obligations under our material contractual obligations 
total operating contractual line of credit leases other obligations contractual obligations less than one year years years over years total contractual obligations we believe our current financial and capital resources will be adequate to fund anticipated business activities throughout fiscal  although there can be no assurance of this as this estimate is based upon a number of assumptions  which may not hold true 
our current projections of the future trd market for vns therapy are not yet proven and will be significantly impacted by the timing of fda s decision for vns treatment in trd and our planned depression launch activities in fiscal unanticipated delays in fda s approval decision may materially change our current revenue and expense projections and negatively impact our liquidity 
we would consider additional financing which would provide funding for expanded market development programs and new clinical development studies to advance existing and new indications for vns therapy as well as leverage our core competencies to exploit non vns neuromodulation opportunities through strategic partnerships 
furthermore  our liquidity could be adversely affected by the factors affecting future operating results discussed below 
factors affecting future operating results and common stock price in addition to the factors described above in this section and in the section of this annual report on form k entitled business  the following additional factors could affect our future results and  as a result  our common stock price 
our common stock price constantly changes 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market under the ticker symbol cybx 
the price of stock on that trading market fluctuates  and we expect that the market price of common stock will continue to fluctuate 
for instance  during the fiscal year ended april   our stock has traded from a high of to a low of per share 
the fluctuation in our stock price is caused by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our sales and operating results  regulatory activities and announcements  results of studies regarding the efficacy of our vns therapy treatment for other indications including depression  alzheimer s disease  anxiety and other disorders  announcements of significant contracts  acquisitions  or capital commitments  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of medical device companies  additions or departures of key personnel  
table of contents sales or purchases of common stock by us  our officers and members of our board of directors  and changes in the general conditions of the economy 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies 
these broad market fluctuations have also adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our consolidated results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be below the expectations of security analysts 
if so  the market price of our shares may decline 
our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter for several reasons  including the extent to which the vns therapy system gains market acceptance  the timing of obtaining marketing approvals for the vns therapy system for other indications  the timing of any approvals for reimbursement by third party payers  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as we expand our clinical  manufacturing  sales and marketing efforts  our ability to retain qualified sales personnel and the availability of key components  materials and contract services  which may depend on our ability to forecast sales 
we rely solely on sales of vns therapy systems for our revenues and if sales of these systems are not achieved  our operating results will be severely harmed 
our product portfolio is limited to vns therapy systems for two indications as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs and as a long term adjunctive treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients years or older who are experiencing a major depressive episode and have not had an adequate response to four or more antidepressant treatments 
moreover  we cannot assure you that sales of the vns therapy system for the treatment of epilepsy will increase 
we do not yet have the approvals for reimbursement of the vns therapy system for the treatment of depression in the us we cannot assure you that we will receive such reimbursement approvals or otherwise be successful in commercializing the vns therapy system for the treatment of depression 
the same uncertainty surrounds our efforts in anxiety disorders  alzheimer s disease applications and other indications for which we currently do not have fda approvals 
our inability to successfully commercialize the vns therapy system for depression and other indications will severely harm our future growth 
we may experience difficulties and delays inherent in the development  manufacturing  marketing and sale of our vns therapy system for the treatment of depression 
we are subject to extensive and rigorous ongoing regulation of the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution and marketing of our product 
our failure to comply with these requirements or the identification of manufacturing or safety problems during commercial marketing could lead to the need for product marketing restrictions  product withdrawal or recall or other voluntary or regulatory action  which could delay further marketing until the product is brought into compliance 
our failure to comply with these requirements may also subject us to stringent penalties 
we may need significant additional capital 
our capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors  including market acceptance of our product and clinical and strategic development opportunities 
a large portion of our expenses is currently fixed  including expenses related to our facilities  equipment and personnel  and we expect to spend significant amounts to market our product for the treatment of depression 
as a result  we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase and will exceed revenues in the first full year after us approval 
consequently  we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability in the future 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
furthermore  if additional capital is required  we may not be able to access sufficient sources or to access capital on terms which are acceptable to us 
we may not be successful in our efforts to develop vns therapy for the treatment of bulimia  alzheimer s disease  anxiety or any other indications 
we are in the process of conducting studies to help us evaluate  and potentially obtain fda approval  for the use of vns therapy as a treatment for bulimia  alzheimer s disease  anxiety and other neurological disorders 
we cannot assure you that our study results 
table of contents will be positive or that we will receive fda approval for the use of our product for the treatment of any other indication 
even if we receive fda approval for another indication  we can provide no assurances with respect to market acceptance 
if our study results are not as we anticipate or if we receive no additional fda approvals or if alternative indications do not prove to be commercially viable  our revenues may not experience the growth that we would anticipate with the successful development of any of these indications 
we may not be able to expand or maintain market acceptance of the use of the vns therapy system to treat epilepsy or depression  which could cause our sales to be lower than expectations 
market acceptance of the vns therapy system will depend on our ability to convince the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation and the vns therapy system 
while the vns therapy system has been implanted in approximately  patients  many physicians are still unfamiliar with this form of therapy 
we believe that existing pharmacological therapies and surgery are the only other approved and currently available therapies competitive with the vns therapy system 
these therapies may be more attractive to patients or their physicians than the vns therapy system in terms of efficacy  cost or reimbursement availability 
furthermore  we have not funded significant post market clinical research that will change physicians opinions or use of our product 
we cannot assure you that sales will increase 
we cannot assure you that the vns therapy system will achieve expanded market acceptance for the treatment of epilepsy  depression or for any other indication 
failure of the vns therapy system to gain additional market acceptance would severely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in our marketing and sales efforts  which could severely harm our business 
since february  we have intensified the preparation of our organization for approval and launch in depression and we have recently significantly expanded our sales and case management organization to support anticipated sales demand in both epilepsy and depression markets 
while the recent approval of vns therapy in trd will likely result in significant revenue growth in fiscal  other factors affecting market acceptance  may significantly affect the size and structure of our sales organization and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts 
accordingly  improvements in sales force productivity are not expected in fiscal  as we are planning to support product launch activities in depression throughout fiscal furthermore  our expectations for potential sales demand in a completely new device market for trd will likely change as we complete our physician targeting programs and promote awareness and acceptance of vns therapy among new psychiatric prescribers 
the time necessary for our expanded sales organization to establish new territories and relationships of trust with new physicians may take longer than projected  which could substantially delay improvements in us sales performance or jeopardize attainment of quarterly revenue goals 
our inability to achieve annual or quarterly revenue targets could substantially harm our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
patient confidentiality and federal and state privacy laws and regulations may adversely impact our patient pull through selling model 
the hipaa privacy rule became effective in april and the hipaa security rule became effective in april in addition  virtually every state has enacted one or more laws to safeguard privacy  and these laws vary significantly from state to state and change frequently 
the hipaa privacy rule preempts a state privacy law only if the state privacy law is narrower in scope than the hipaa privacy rule 
consequently  the applicable privacy rules can vary state by state  and the determination of the privacy rules applicable in any one state can be very difficult 
the operation of our business involves the collection and use of substantial amounts of protected health information  including patient information provided by physicians to assist in the treatment of patients  information provided by patients themselves to assist them in scheduling surgery and confirming their eligibility for third party reimbursement  patient information provided by hospitals in connection with their efforts to obtain third party reimbursement  patient information collected by our product performance department in the investigation of product complaints and the tracking of implanted devices 
we endeavor to conduct our business as a covered entity under the hipaa privacy rule and consistent with the texas privacy laws  obtaining hipaa compliant patient authorizations where required to support the collection and use of patient information  including in connection with our patient identification and qualification piq pull through selling model 
we also sometimes act as a business associate for a covered entity 
for example  we sometimes provide assistance to hospitals covered entities in connection with their claims for third party reimbursement of vns therapy systems 
table of contents and procedures 
even if our business model is compliant with the hipaa privacy rule and the texas privacy laws  it may not be compliant with the privacy laws of all states 
in addition  despite extensive efforts to conduct our business as a covered entity under the hipaa privacy rule and the texas privacy laws  the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services or another government enforcement agency may determine that we are obligated to comply with the hipaa privacy rule or another law and that our business model or operations are not in compliance  which could subject us to penalties and could severely limit our ability to market and sell vns therapy under our existing business model and could harm our business growth and financial condition 
we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate third party reimbursement on our product 
our ability to commercialize the vns therapy system successfully depends in part on whether third party payers  including private healthcare insurers  managed care plans  the us government s medicare and medicaid programs and others  agree both to cover the vns therapy system and associated procedures and services and to reimburse at adequate levels for the costs of the vns therapy system and the related services in the us or internationally 
if we fail to maintain or expand favorable coverage decisions for the vns therapy system in a timely manner  patients and their physicians could be deterred from using the vns therapy system  which could reduce our sales and severely harm our business 
our current and future expense estimates are based  in large part  on estimates of future sales  which are difficult to predict 
we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected sales shortfall 
if increased expenses are not accompanied by increased sales  our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for any particular quarter could be harmed 
if our suppliers and manufacturers are unable to meet our demand for materials  components and contract services  we may be forced to qualify new vendors or change our product design which would impair our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
we rely upon sole source suppliers for certain of the key components  materials and contract services used in manufacturing the vns therapy system 
we periodically experience discontinuation or unavailability of components  materials and contract services which may require us to qualify alternative sources or  if no such alternative sources are identified  change our product design 
we believe that pursuing and qualifying alternative sources and or redesigning specific components of the vns therapy system  if or when necessary  could consume significant resources 
in addition  such changes generally require regulatory submissions and approvals 
any extended delays in or an inability to secure alternative sources for these or other components  materials and contract services could result in product supply and manufacturing interruptions  which could significantly harm our business 
our products may be found to have defects that result in product recalls 
the vns therapy system includes an electronic pulse generator and lead designed to be implanted in the human body 
component failures  manufacturing or shipping problems or design defects could result in the product not delivering the therapy for which it is indicated 
the occurrence of such problems or other adverse clinical reactions could result in a recall of our products  possibly requiring explantation and potential reimplantation of the vns therapy system  which may increase risk to the patient 
any product recall could severely harm our business and our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use  which could diminish the value of our products and impair our ability to compete 
our success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for the vns therapy system and its improvements  and for vagus nerve stimulation therapy 
to that end  we have acquired licenses under certain patents and have patented and intend to continue to seek patents on our own inventions used in our products and treatment methods 
the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and time consuming  and we cannot assure you that patents will be issued from our currently pending or future applications or that  if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us 
further  the protection offered by the licensed international patents is not as strong as that offered by the licensed us patents due to differences in patent laws 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy 

table of contents we may engage in litigation to protect our proprietary rights  or defend against infringement claims by third parties  causing us to suffer significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us  may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using the vns therapy system  any of which could severely harm our business 
intense competition and rapid technological changes could reduce our ability to market our products and achieve sales 
we believe that existing and future pharmaceutical therapies will continue to be the primary competition for the vns therapy system 
we may also face competition from other medical device companies that have the technology  experience and capital resources to develop alternative devices for the treatment of epilepsy and depression 
medtronic  inc  for example  continues to assess clinically an implantable signal generator used with an invasive deep brain probe  or thalamic stimulator  for the treatment of neurological disorders and has received fda approval for the device for the treatment of essential tremor  including that associated with parkinson s disease 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do and have obtained third party reimbursement approvals for their therapies 
in addition  the healthcare industry is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
our competitors may develop technologies and obtain regulatory approval for products that are more effective in treating epilepsy and depression than our current or future products 
in addition  advancements in surgical techniques may make surgery a more attractive therapy for epilepsy and depression 
the development by others of new treatment methods with novel drugs  medical devices or surgical techniques for epilepsy and depression could render the vns therapy system non competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including new products and technology  which could severely harm our business and our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to claims of product liability and we may not have the resources or insurance to cover the cost for losses under these claims 
as an implantable medical device  the manufacture and sale of the vns therapy system entails the risk of product liability claims  which we have received from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
we may be responsible for large deductibles for each claim  and our product liability coverage may not be adequate to cover judgments that may result from these claims 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may only be available at significantly higher premiums or not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could significantly harm our business and financial condition 
if we do not continue to comply with changing government laws and regulations  we could lose our ability to market and sell our product or be subject to substantial fines or other penalties 
the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of the vns therapy system are subject to extensive and rigorous federal and state laws and regulations  including regulations from the department of health and human services related to medicare  hipaa and fda and from comparable state agencies 
in the future  it will be necessary for us to obtain additional government approvals for other applications of the vns therapy system and for modified or future generation products 
it will also be necessary for us to ensure that our marketing and sales practices comply with all laws and regulations 
commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is also subject to regulatory approvals from the appropriate authorities in such countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
moreover  regulatory approvals may include regulatory restrictions on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  confiscations or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to obtain additional future regulatory approvals on a timely 
table of contents basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such future approvals  suspension or withdrawal of previously received approvals or recalls of the vns therapy system could severely harm our ability to market and sell our current and future products and improvements 
we are subject to federal and state laws governing our sales and marketing practices  and failure to adhere to these laws could result in substantial fines and other penalties 
we are subject to certain laws and regulations  including the federal anti kickback statute and the hipaa privacy rule  that govern the sales and marketing practices of healthcare companies 
in  we adopted a healthcare law compliance program  including our business practice standards  which is a set of policies that embody the advamed code of ethics for interactions with health care professionals 
we endeavor to conduct our business in compliance with our business practice standards and to ensure continued compliance through regular education of the company s employees and regular audits of employee activities 
although we believe that these efforts have been successful and that we are in compliance with our policies and the healthcare laws  given the complexity of our patient pull through business model  including extensive interactions with patients and healthcare professionals  and the large number of field personnel employed by the company  violations of our policy and the law could occur 
we could be subject to investigation by the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services or the department of justice 
if investigated  we could be forced to incur substantial expense responding to the investigation and defending our actions 
if unsuccessful in our defense  we could be found to be in violation of the healthcare laws and be subject to substantial fines and penalties  including exclusion of our products from medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
our international operations are subject to risks not generally associated with commercialization efforts in the us we may not be successful in increasing our international market sales or in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
the anticipated international nature of our business is also expected to subject us and our representatives  agents and distributors to laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or where the vns therapy system is sold 
the regulation of medical devices in a number of such jurisdictions  particularly in the european union  continues to develop and new laws or regulations may impair our ability to market and sell our products in those jurisdictions 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our ability to maintain our costs or capture new business could suffer 
in connection with the commercialization of the vns therapy system in the us for trd  we have begun and intend to continue to expand significantly the scope of our operations 
such activities have placed  and may continue to place a significant strain on our resources and operations 
our ability to manage such growth effectively will depend upon our ability to attract  hire and retain highly qualified employees and management personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  management information and financial control systems 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business will suffer 
we received a letter from the senate finance committee sfc advising us that it is examining fda s handling of our pma supplement for the use of vns therapy to address treatment resistant depression 
the sfc s letter requested that we provide the sfc with certain documents and information 
responding to this request and any further requests by the sfc could divert the efforts and attention of our management team 
we are unable to provide assurance as to the time it will take for the sfc to complete its review or of such review s ultimate consequence  if any 
we have been named in a putative class action shareholder lawsuit 
the company and certain of its officers have been named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit 
a discussion of this lawsuit is contained in item legal proceedings 
although it is not possible at this early stage to predict the likely outcome of this lawsuit  an adverse result could have a material adverse affect on us  our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to limited market risk on interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments in commercial paper  auction rate securities and our line of credit 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
based upon the average outstanding balances in cash  cash equivalents and our line of credit  a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
due to the global reach of our business  we are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly with the us dollar over the euro 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiary is consolidated into our financial results and is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially impacted by changes in these or other factors 
at this time  we have not deemed it to be cost effective to engage in a program of hedging the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our operating results using derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that  if the us dollar uniformly weakened against the euro  the effect upon net income would be favorable by approximately  or 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened against the euro  the impact on net income would decrease by approximately  or
