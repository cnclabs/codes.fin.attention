the table above provides comparative details for the company s bc operation 
liquidity and capital resources the company s predominant need for working capital is to finance its receivables and inventory levels 
in order to finance its requirements the company has relied on secured debt financings  trade financing  equity based financing as well as its cash flow from operations 
the company s major lender  international investment group trade opportunities fund iig  provides receivable and inventory financing to its three operating segments 
in addition  most of the company s major vendors provide trade credit for purchases ranging from cod to days

the lc was secured by a  cash deposit as well as certain reserves modified under the loan and security agreement with iig 
the lc expired in may  at which time the cash deposit and reserves were released 
the increased vendor line of credit facility has enabled the company to secure special promotional products specifically designed for the cold and flu season  which increases the company s average purchases from approximately  per order to approximately  per order 
management believes that its iig facility has enabled the company to achieve its recent growth 
by providing financing on all of the company s tangible assets  the company has been able to expand its sales through receivable order and inventory financing support 
in addition iig provides the company with a financing option in canada  borrowing against anticipated vendor allowances as well as securing product through sales order financing 
however iig s financing rate is and as a result caused financing charges to increase materially in management believes that to achieve profitable operations  financing costs must be reduced 
by improving its operating results and especially ebitda  management expects to generate positive cash flow  assuming financing costs can be reduced 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will reduce its financing costs  so that it can improve its operating results 
failure to reduce financing costs will inhibit the company s growth 
management believes that its current capital structure needs to be improved in order to secure a profitable operation 
as the company s operations have grown the company has been able to raise additional capital predominately through its shareholders and institutional placements 
in  the company raised million through the issuance of series a class b preferred stock and  through notes secured by its investment in itt  a investee 
in december  the company sold accounts receivable attributable to a selected customer base to west coast supplies inc for  this promissory note  which is secured by the accounts receivable  requires monthly payments of principle and interest at for seven years  beginning in january as a condition for the sale  the company is obligated to issue west coast  shares of common stock  which will vest through april  in the event the value of the shares is less than  at april   the company will be obligated to pay the difference in cash or additional shares 
the company does not anticipate selling selected products to this customer base in the future 
sales of selected products to this customer base approximated  in proset further intends to service the salon hair care needs of beautybuys 
com and phs retail based accounts 
the company beleives that this transaction should have a positive effect on working capital for its proset operation and should reduce the dependence of asset based financing for this operation 
in november  the board of directors approved a private placement in which units were offered  with each unit consisting of  shares of unregistered class b  series a preferred stock and  shares of unregistered restricted common stock at a purchase price of  per unit

also  in  the company converted  outstanding debt of iig into  shares of common stock 
on april   the company completed a financing with laurus master funds laurus 
the financing consisted of a million secured convertible debenture that converts into common stock under certain conditions at per share and matures on april  the debenture provides for monthly payments of  plus interest  commencing october  in addition  laurus was issued  warrants exercisable at per share

the debenture has a three year term with a coupon rate of prime plus 
as the company grows it intends to raise additional capital to accommodate its growth plans however  there can be no assurance that additional capital can be attained 
working capital at december  totaled approximately million a increase of million from the company s operations require financing of inventory and receivables 
iig provides the company s operating subsidiaries a facility that allows for borrowings of up to against eligible accounts receivables and against eligible inventory and orders in transit 
it is important to note that as the borrowings increase from iig  commensurate with increased revenues and additional need for inventory  additional capital will be needed to support the borrowing base with iig 
therefore as the financial leverage of the company increases  additional capital is needed to support the company s growth 
the company turns its overall inventory on average approximately every days  its receivables average days of collections the turn is computed on ending balances 
management believes that continued cost containment  improved financial and operating controls  and a focused sales and marketing effort should provide sufficient cash flow from operations in the near term 
achievement of these goals  however  will be dependent upon the company s attainment of increased revenues  improved operating costs  reduced financing cost and trade support levels that are consistent with management s plans 
such operating performance will be subject to financial  economic and other factors beyond its control  and there can be no assurance that the company s goals will be achieved 
the following table presents the company s expected cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations less than after year years years years total line of credit   notes payable    operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      critical accounting policies 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and disclosures on the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management uses authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making judgments 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable are due from businesses engaged in the distribution of grocery  health and beauty products as well as from consumers who purchase health and beauty products and premium handmade cigars from the company s web sites 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are due within days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the company s historical collections experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of its accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  the company looks at historical write offs of its receivables 
the company also looks at the credit quality of its customer base as well as changes in its credit policies 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of reserves  which have been deducted for financial statement purposes  but have not been deducted for income tax purposes as well as net operating loss carry forwards 
the company annually reviews the deferred tax asset accounts to determine if is appears more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
at december   the company has established a full valuation allowance 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company reviews its long lived assets periodically to determine potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with expected net cash flows expected to be provided by the operating activities of the business or related products 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value  the company would determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
an impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the long lived assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets and their ultimate disposition 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying amount of the asset would be written down to an amount to reflect the fair value of the asset

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas no 
r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
the provisions of this statement are effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after june  the company adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
inventory costs 
this statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing and removes the so abnormal criterion that under certain circumstances could have led to the capitalization of these items 
sfas no 
requires that idle facility expense  excess spoilage  double freight and re handling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
sfas also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead expenses to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  the company adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of non monetary assets  an amendment of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 which differed from the international accounting standards board s iasb method of accounting for exchanges of similar productive assets 
statement no 
replaces the exception from fair value measurement in apb no 
 with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the statement is to be applied prospectively and is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or result of operations 
seasonality sales by phs group and proset usually peak at the end of the a calendar quarter  when the company s suppliers offer promotions which lower prices and  in turn  the company is able to lower its prices and increase sales volume 
suppliers tend to promote at quarterly end and as a result reduced products costs may increase sales 
in particular  the second and first quarters are usually better operating quarters 
sales of beauty care products and fragrances increase over traditional gift giving holidays such as christmas  mother s day  father s day  and valentine s day 
cigar product sales also increase during holiday periods and summer months as well as around special sporting events 
inflation the company believes that inflation  under certain circumstances  could be beneficial to the company s major business  phs group 
when inflationary pressures drive product costs up  the company s customers sometimes purchase greater quantities of product to expand their inventories to protect against further pricing increases 
this enables the company to sell greater quantities of products that are sensitive to inflationary pressures 
however  inflationary pressures frequently increase interest rates 
since the company is dependent on financing  any increase in interest rates will increase the company s credit costs  thereby reducing its profits 
forward looking information and cautionary statements other than the factual matters set forth herein  the matters and items set forth in this report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
these statements relate to future events or the company s future financial performance and include  but are not limited to  statements concerning the anticipated benefits and risks of the company s key strategic partnerships  business relationships and acquisitions  the company s ability to attract and retain customers  the anticipated benefits and risks associated with the company s business strategy  including those relating to its distribution and fulfillment strategy and its current and future product and service offerings  the company s future operating results and the future value of its common stock  the anticipated size or trends of the market segments in which the company competes and the anticipated competition in those markets  potential government regulation  and the company s future capital requirements and its ability to satisfy its capital needs 
furthermore  in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  could  should  expect  plan  intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential or continue  the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially 
factors that could cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified herein and other risks included from time to time in the company s other securities and exchange commission sec reports and press releases  copies of which are available from the company upon request 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  it cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
moreover the company assumes no responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in its expectations 
in addition to the other information in this form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company business because these factors may have a significant impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this form k and the risks discussed in the company s other sec filings  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
the company has incurred operating losses 
the company has a long history of operating losses 
to date  a large portion of the company s expenses have been financed through capital raising activities 
although the company has narrowed its losses  it still continues to report operating deficits as opposed to profits 
a large portion of the company s historical losses are a direct result of fees and expenses paid for in stock and or other working capital financing 
due to a pattern of historical losses  there is no assurance that further financing will not be needed for operating purposes 
internet the internet environment is still relatively new to business and is subject to inherent risks as in any new developing business including rapidly developing technology with which to attempt to keep pace and level of acceptance and level of consumer knowledge regarding its use 
dependence on public trends 
the company s business is subject to the effects of changing customer preferences and the economy  both of which are difficult to predict and over which the company has no control 
a change in either consumer preferences or a down turn in the economy may affect the company s business prospects 
potential product liability 
as a participant in the distribution chain between the manufacturer and consumer  the company would likely be named as a defendant in any product liability action brought by a consumer 
to date  no claims have been asserted against the company for product liability  there can be no assurance  however  that such claims will not arise in the future 
currently  the company does carry product liability insurance 
in the event that any products liability claim is not fully funded by insurance  and if the company is unable to recover damages from the manufacturer or supplier of the product that caused such injury  the company may be required to pay some or all of such claim from its own funds 
any such payment could have a material adverse impact on the company 
reliance on common carriers 
although the company has in the last few years leased a fleet of trucks operated by the company to make deliveries  the company is still dependent  for shipping of product purchases  on common carriers in the trucking industry 
although the company uses several hundred common carriers  the trucking industry is subject to strikes from time to time  which could have material adverse effect on the company s operations if alternative modes of shipping are not then available 
additionally the trucking industry is susceptible to various natural disasters which can close transportation lanes in any given region of the country 
to the extent common carriers are prevented from or delayed in utilizing local transportation lanes  the company will likely incur higher freight costs due to the limited availability of trucks during any such period that transportation lanes are restricted 
competition 
the company is subject to competition in all of its various product sale businesses 
while these industries may be highly fragmented  with no one distributor dominating the industry  the company is subject to competitive pressures from other distributors based on price and service and product quality and origin 
litigation the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions should not materially affect the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company  but there can be no assurance as to this 
possible loss of nasdaq small cap listing 
synergy s qualification for trading on the nasdaq small cap system has in the past been questioned  the focus being on the market quotes for the company s stock  the current bid price having for a time been reduced below the minimum nasdaq standard of and having been below such level for an appreciable period of time  as well as the company also being notified in the past that stockholders equity has fallen below minimum nasdaq continued listing standard of  nasdaq has established  and the commission has approved  certain maintenance requirements which the company must adhere to remain listed  including the requirement that a stock listed in such market have a bid price greater than or equal to and the listed company maintain stockholders equity above  the bid price per share for the common stock of synergy has been below in the past and the common stock has remained on the nasdaq small cap system because synergy has complied with alternative criteria which are now eliminated under the new rules 
if the bid price dips below per share  and is not brought above such level for a sustained period of time or the company fails to maintain stockholders equity at a level of at least  the common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq small cap system and thereafter trading would be reported in the nasdaq s otc bulletin board or in the pink sheets 
see item market for the registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters supra for a more in depth discussion of the company s current nasdaq listing status in the event of delisting from the nasdaq small cap system  the common stock would become subject to the rules adopted by the commission regulating broker dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks  including what the company believes to be stringent disclosure rules very different from nasdaq trading practice procedures 
these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules 
if the common stock became subject to the penny stock rules  many broker dealers may be unwilling to engage in transactions in the company s securities because of the added disclosure requirements  thereby making it more difficult for purchasers of the common stock to dispose of their shares 
the company s common stock has historically remained at nasdaq trading levels above except for limited periods of time and the company has achieved and is confident of maintaining a level of stockholders equity above  historical stability combined with the company s increasing business share in the market and its continuing establishment as a viable force in the industries wherein it participates gives the company confidence that its susceptibility to market deficiencies is in a much lessened state then in years past and that it can continue to achieve and maintain nasdaq listing compliance  but of this there can be no assurance 
risks of business development 
because still the lines of product and product distribution established for the company are relatively new and different from its historical non internet product distribution business  the company s operations in these areas should continue to be considered subject to all of the risks inherent in a new business enterprise  including the absence of an appreciable operating history and the expense of new product development and uncertainties on demand and logistics of delivery and other satisfaction of customer demands 
various problems  expenses  complications and delays may be encountered in connection with the development of the company s new products and methods of product distribution 
these expenses must either be paid out of the proceeds of future offerings or out of generated revenues and company profits and will likely be a drain on company capital if revenue and revenue collection does not keep pace with company expenses 
there can be no assurance as to the continued availability of funds from any of these sources 
rapidly changing market may impact operations 
the market for the company s products is rapidly changing with evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its continued ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products and features to meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards and to continue to have access to such products from their sources on a pricing schedule conducive to the company operating at a profit 
the company will have to develop and implement an appropriate marketing strategy for each of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development of future products or that the company s current or future products will achieve market acceptance levels and be made available for sale by the company conducive to the company s fiscal needs 
any delay or failure of these products to achieve market acceptance or limits on their availability for sale by the company would adversely affect the company s business 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
management believes actions taken and presently being taken to meet and enhance the company s operating and financial requirements should assure and provide the opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern 
however  management cannot predict the outcome of future operations and no adjustments have been made to offset the outcome of this uncertainty 
extensive and increasing regulation of tobacco products and litigation may impact cigar industry 
the tobacco industry in general has been subject to extensive regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
recent trends have increased regulation of the tobacco industry 
although regulation initially focused on cigarette manufacturers  it has begun to have a broader impact on the industry as a whole and may focus more directly on cigars in the future 
the increase in popularity of cigars may likely lead to an increase in regulation of cigars 
a variety of bills relating to tobacco issues have been introduced in the us congress  including bills that would i prohibit the advertising and promotion of all tobacco products or restrict or eliminate the deductibility of such advertising expense  ii increase labeling requirements on tobacco products to include  among others things  addiction warnings and lists of additives and toxins  iii shift control of tobacco products and advertisements from the federal trade commission the ftc to the food and drug administration the fda  iv increase tobacco excise taxes and v require tobacco companies to pay for health care costs incurred by the federal government in connection with tobacco related diseases 
there has also been recent cooperation between federal and state authorities to curtail internet sales of tobacco products because of tax issues as well as underage purchase questions 
future enactment of such proposals or similar bills may have an adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
although  except for warning labeling and smoke free facilities  current legislation and regulation focuses on cigarette smoking and sales  there is no assurance that the scope of legislation will not be expanded in the future to encompass cigars as well 
a majority of states restrict or prohibit smoking in certain public places and restrict the sale of tobacco products to minors 
local legislative and regulatory bodies also have increasingly moved to curtail smoking by prohibiting smoking in certain buildings or areas or by designating smoking areas 
these restrictions generally do not distinguish between cigarettes and cigars 
these restrictions and future restrictions of a similar nature have and likely will continue to have an adverse effect on the company s sales or operations because of resulting difficulty placed upon advertising and sale of tobacco products  such as restrictions and in many cases prohibition of counter access to or display of premium handmade cigars  and or decisions by retailers not to advertise for sale and in many cases to sell tobacco products because of public pressure to stop the selling of tobacco products 
numerous proposals also have been and are being considered at the state and local levels  in addition to federal regulations  to restrict smoking in certain public areas  regulating point of sale placement and promotions of tobacco products and requiring warning labels 
increased cigar consumption and the publicity such increase has received may increase the risk of additional regulation 
the company cannot predict the ultimate content  timing or effect of any additional regulation of tobacco products by any federal  state  local or regulatory body  and there can be no assurance that any such legislation or regulation would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition numerous tobacco litigation has been commenced and may in the future be instituted  all of which may adversely affect albeit focusing primarily on cigarette smoking cigar consumption and sale and may pressure applicable government entities to institute further and stricter legislation to restrict and possibly prohibit cigar sale and consumption  any and all of which may have an adverse affect on company business see government regulation tobacco industry regulation and tobacco industry litigation supra 
no dividends likely 
no dividends have been paid on the common stock since inception  nor  by reason of its current financial status and its contemplated financial requirements  does synergy contemplate or anticipate paying any dividends upon its common stock in the foreseeable future 
potential liability for content on the company s web site 
because the company posts product information and other content on its web sites  the company faces potential liability for negligence  copyright  patent  trademark  defamation  indecency and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials that the company posts 
such claims have been brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  against other internet content distributors 
in addition  the company could be exposed to liability with respect to the unauthorized duplication of content or unauthorized use of other parties proprietary technology or infiltration into the company s system by unauthorized personnel 
the company s net sales would be harmed if it experiences significant credit card fraud 
a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would harm the company s net sales and results of operations because it does not carry insurance against such risk 
under current credit card practices  the company may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions where it does not obtain a cardholder s signature  a frequent practice in internet sales 
the company depends on continued use of the internet and growth of the online product purchase market 
the company s future revenues and profits  if any  substantially depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium of business and communication by the company s target customers 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet has occurred only recently 
as a result  acceptance and use may not continue to develop at historical rates  and a sufficiently broad base of consumers may not adopt  and continue to use  the internet and other online services as a medium of commerce 
in addition  the internet may not be accepted as a viable long term commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements and or potential customer continued preferences for more traditional see and touch purchasing 
the company s success will depend  in large part  upon third parties maintaining the internet infrastructure to provide a reliable network backbone with the speed  data capacity  security and hardware necessary for reliable internet access and services and hopeful continued shifting of potential customers shopping preferences to the internet 
if the company does not respond to rapid technology changes  its services could become obsolete and its business would be seriously harmed 
as the internet and online commerce industry evolve  the company must license leading technologies useful in its business  enhance its existing services  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of its prospective customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
the company may not be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt its proprietary technology and transaction processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if the company is unable to do so  it could adversely impact its ability to build on its varied businesses and attract and retain customers 
potential future sales of company stock 
the majority of the shares of common stock of the company outstanding are restricted securities as that term is defined in rule promulgated under the securities act of in general under rule a person or persons whose shares are aggregated who has satisfied a one year holding period may  under certain circumstances  sell within any three month period a number of shares which does not exceed the greater of of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale 
rule also permits  under certain circumstances  the sale of shares by a person who is not an affiliate of the company and who has satisfied a two year holding period without  any quantity limitation 
the majority of holders of the shares of the outstanding common stock of the company deemed restricted securities have already satisfied at least their one year holding period or will do so with the next fiscal year  and such stock is either presently or within the next fiscal year will become eligible for sale in the public market subject to volume limitations of rule when applicable 
the company is unable to predict the effect that sales of its common stock under rule  or otherwise  may have on the then prevailing market price of the common stock 
however  the company believes that the sales of such stock under rule may have a depressive effect upon the market 
the company may not be able to continue attracting new customers 
the success of the company s business model depends in large part on its continued ability to increase its number of customers 
the market for its businesses may grow more slowly than anticipated because of or become saturated with competitors  many of which may offer lower prices or broader distribution 
the company is also highly dependant on internet sales which require interest of potential suppliers in the internet mode of product purchasing 
some potential suppliers may not want to join the company s networks because they are concerned about the possibility of their products being listed together with their competitors products thus limiting availability of product mix made available by the company 
if the company cannot continue to bring new customers to its sites or maintain its existing customer base or attract listing of a mixture of product  the company may be unable to offer the benefits of the network model at levels sufficient to attract and retain customers and sustain its business 
because the company s industry is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry  the company may not be able to effectively compete 
the us market for e commerce services is extremely competitive 
the company expects competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and enter the e commerce market  and new competitors enter the market 
the principal competitive factors are the quality and breadth of services provided  potential for successful transaction activity and price 
e commerce markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product and service introductions 
the company may fail to update or introduce new market pricing formats  selling techniques and or other mechanics and administrative tools and formats for internet sales consistent with current technology on a timely basis or at all 
if its fails to introduce new service offerings or to improve its existing service offerings in response to industry developments  or if its prices are not competitive  the company could lose customers  which could lead to a loss of revenues 
because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the e commerce market  competition from other established and emerging companies may develop in the future 
many of the company s competitors may also have well established relationships with the company s existing and prospective customers 
increased competition is likely to result in fee reductions  reduced margins  longer sales cycles for the company s services and a decrease or loss of its market share  any of which could harm its business  operating results or financial condition 
many of the company s competitors have  and new potential competitors may have  more experience developing internet based software applications and integrated purchasing solutions  larger technical staffs  larger customer bases  more established distribution channels  greater brand recognition and greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company has 
in addition  competitors may be able to develop products and services that are superior to those of the company or that achieve greater customer acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the e commerce solutions offered by the company s competitors now or in the future will not be perceived as superior to those of the company by either businesses or consumers 
the company s business may suffer if it is not able to protect important intellectual property 
the company s ability to compete effectively against other companies in its industry will depend  in part  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology and systems designs relating to its technologies 
the company does not know whether it has been or will be completely successful in doing so 
further  its competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to those of the company 
the company may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of its proprietary knowledge 
the company relies  in part  on contractual provisions to protect its trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
these agreements may be breached  and the company may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
its trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently discovered by competitors 
its inability to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology could harm its business  results of operations and financial condition by adversely affecting its ability to compete 
others may assert that the company s technology infringes their intellectual property rights 
the company believes that its technology does not infringe the proprietary rights of others 
however  the e commerce industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and trademarks and frequent claims and litigation based on allegations of patent infringement and violation of other intellectual property rights 
as the e commerce market and the functionality of products in the industry continues to grow and overlap  the company believes that the possibility of an intellectual property claim against it will increase 
for example  the company may inadvertently infringe an intellectual property right of which it is unaware  or there may be applications to protect intellectual property rights now pending of which it is unaware which it may be infringing when they are issued in the future  or the company s service or systems may incorporate and or utilize third party technologies that infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
the company has been and expects to continue to be subject to alleged infringement claims 
the defense of any claims of infringement made against the company by third parties  whether or not meritorious  could involve significant legal costs and require the company s management to divert time and attention from its business operations 
either of these consequences of an infringement claim could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
if the company is unsuccessful in defending any claims of infringement  it may be forced to obtain licenses or to pay royalties to continue to use its technology 
the company may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if the company fails to obtain necessary licenses or other rights  or if these licenses are costly  its operating results may suffer either from reductions in revenues through the company s inability to serve customers or from increases in costs to license third party technologies 
the company s business may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to license software that is necessary for its service offering 
through distributors  the company licenses a variety of commercially available internet technologies  which are used in its services and systems to perform key functions 
as a result  the company is to a certain extent dependent upon continuing to maintain these technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to replace the functionality provided by much of its purchased internet technologies on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of that functionality could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s systems infrastructure may not keep pace with the demands of its customers 
interruptions of service as a result of a high volume of traffic and or transactions could diminish the attractiveness of the company s services and its ability to attract and retain customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of its service  or that it will be able to expand and upgrade its systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases in a timely manner 
the company currently maintains systems in the us any failure to expand or upgrade its systems could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition by reducing or interrupting revenue flow and by limiting its ability to attract new customers 
any such failure could also have a material adverse effect on the business of its customers  which could damage the company s reputation and expose it to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability 
a system failure could cause delays or interruptions of service to the company s customers 
service offerings involving complex technology often contain errors or performance problems 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial implementation of new services or enhancements to existing services 
although the company attempts to resolve all errors that it believes would be considered serious by its customers before implementation  its systems are not error free 
errors or performance problems could result in lost revenues or cancellation of customer agreements and may expose the company to litigation and potential liability 
in the past  the company has discovered errors in software used in the company after its incorporation into company sites 
the company cannot assure that undetected errors or performance problems in its existing or future services will not be discovered or that known errors considered minor by it will not be considered serious by its customers 
the company has experienced periodic minor system interruptions  which may continue to occur from time to time 
the functioning of the company s systems or the systems of third parties on which it relies could be disrupted by factors outside the company s control 
the company s success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware systems 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
despite any precautions the company takes or plans to take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions in its services 
in addition  if any hosting service fails to provide the data communications capacity the company requires  as a result of human error  natural disaster or other operational disruption  interruptions in the company s services could result 
any damage to or failure of its systems could result in reductions in  or terminations of  its services  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may acquire other businesses or technologies  which could result in dilution to its stockholders  or operational or integration difficulties which could impair its financial performance 
if appropriate opportunities present themselves  the company may acquire complementary or strategic businesses  technologies  services or products that it believes will be useful in the growth of its business 
the company does not currently have any commitments or agreements with respect to any new acquisitions 
they may not be able to identify  negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully 
even if the company does succeed in acquiring a business  technology  service or product  the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may require significant attention from the company s management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of its business 
moreover the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized or may depend on the continued service of acquired personnel who could choose to leave 
if the company makes future acquisitions  it may issue shares of stock that dilute other stockholders  incur debt  assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets  any of which might harm its financial results and cause its stock price to decline 
any financing that it might need for future acquisitions may only be available to it on terms that restrict its business or that impose on it costs that reduce its revenue 
the company s success depends on the continued growth of the internet and online commerce 
the company s future revenues and profits depend to a large extent upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet and other online services as a medium for commerce by merchants and consumers 
the use of the internet and e commerce may not continue to develop at past rates and a sufficiently broad base of business and individual customers may not adopt or continue to use the internet as a medium of commerce 
the market for the sale of goods and services over the internet is a relatively new and emerging market 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
growth in the company s customer base depends on obtaining businesses and consumers who have historically used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods 
for the company to be successful  these market participants must accept and use novel ways of conducting business and exchanging information 
e commerce may not prove to be a viable medium for purchasing for the following reasons  any of which could seriously harm the company s business the necessary infrastructure for internet communications may not develop adequately  the company s potential customers  buyers and suppliers may have security and confidentiality concerns  complementary products  such as high speed modems and high speed communication lines  may not be developed or be adequately available  alternative purchasing solutions may be implemented  buyers may dislike the reduction in the human contact inherent in traditional purchasing methods  use of the internet and other online services may not continue to increase or may increase more slowly than expected  the development or adoption of new technology standards and protocols may be delayed or may not occur  and new and burdensome governmental regulations may be imposed 
the company s success depends on the continued reliability of the internet 
the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users  frequency of use and bandwidth requirements 
there can be no assurance that the infrastructure of the internet and other online services will be able to support the demands placed upon them 
furthermore  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and could face such outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could adversely affect the level of internet usage and also the level of traffic and the processing of transactions 
in addition  the internet or other online services could lose their viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet or other online service activity  or due to increased governmental regulation 
changes in or insufficient availability of telecommunications services or other internet service providers to support the internet or other online services also could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the internet and other online services generally and the company s service in particular 
if use of the internet and other online services does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  if the infrastructure of the internet and other online services does not effectively support growth that may occur  or if the internet and other online services do not become a viable commercial marketplace  the company will have to adapt its business model to the new environment  which would materially adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation of the internet may impede the company s growth or add to its operating costs 
like many internet based businesses  the company operates in an environment of tremendous uncertainty as to potential government regulation 
the internet has rapidly emerged as a commerce medium  and governmental agencies have not yet been able to adapt all existing regulations to the internet environment 
laws and regulations have been introduced or are under consideration and court decisions have been or may be reached in the us and other countries in which the company does business that affect the internet or other online services  covering issues such as pricing  user privacy  freedom of expression  access charges  content and quality of products and services  advertising  intellectual property rights and information security 
in addition  it is uncertain how existing laws governing issues such as taxation  property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  libel  obscenity and personal privacy will be applied to the internet 
the majority of these laws were adopted prior to the introduction of the internet and  as a result  do not address the unique issues of the internet 
recent laws that contemplate the internet  such as the digital millennium copyright act in the us  have not yet been fully interpreted by the courts and their applicability is therefore uncertain 
the digital millennium copyright act provides certain safe harbors that limits the risk of copyright infringement liability for service providers such as the company with respect to infringing activities engaged in by users of the service 
in the area of user privacy  several states have legislation and or have proposed legislation that limits or would limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies 
the federal trade commission also has become increasingly involved in this area 
the company does not sell personal user information regarding its customers 
the company does use aggregated data for analysis regarding the company network  and does use personal user information in the performance of its services for its customers 
since the company does not control what its customers do with the personal user information they collect  there can be no assurance that its customers sites will be considered compliant 
as online commerce evolves  the company expects that federal  state or foreign agencies will continue to adopt regulations covering issues such as pricing  content  user privacy  and quality of products and services 
any future regulation may have a negative impact on the company s business by restricting its methods of operation or imposing additional costs 
although many of these regulations may not apply to its business directly  the company anticipates that laws regulating the solicitation  collection or processing of personal information could indirectly affect its business 
internet regulation which has met with the most successful challenges is that which touches upon free speech 
title v of the telecommunications act of  known as the communications decency act of  prohibits the knowing transmission of any comment  request  suggestion  proposal  image or other communication that is obscene or pornographic to any recipient under the age of the prohibitions scope and the liability associated with a violation are currently unsettled 
in addition  although substantial portions of the communications decency act of have been held to be unconstitutional  the company cannot be certain that similar legislation will not be enacted and upheld in the future 
subsequent attempts at such legislation such as the child online protection act passed in have met with similar and successful constitutional attack 
it is possible that such legislation could expose companies involved in online commerce to liability  which could limit the growth of online commerce generally 
legislation like the communications decency act and child online protection act could reduce the growth in internet usage and decrease its acceptance as a communications and commerce medium 
the worldwide availability of internet web sites often results in sales of goods to buyers outside the jurisdiction in which the company or its customers are located  and foreign jurisdictions may claim that the company or its customers are required to comply with their laws 
foreign regulation of internet use has not met with the success of constitutional and other judicial scrutiny that us regulation has been limited by 
as an internet company  it is also unclear which jurisdictions may find that the company is conducting business therein 
its failure to qualify to do business in a jurisdiction that requires it to do so could subject the company to fines or penalties and could result in its inability to enforce contracts in that jurisdiction 
the company is not aware of any recent related legislation other than that specifically referenced herein which may affect the manner in which the company utilizes the internet in its business but there can be no assurance that future government regulation will not be enacted further restricting use of the internet that might adversely affect the company s business 
taxes may be imposed on internet commerce 
in the us  the company does not collect sales or other similar taxes on goods sold through the company s internet websites 
the internet tax freedom act of  extended through november and internet access tax prohibitions though november   prohibits the imposition of new or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce by united states federal and state taxing authorities except for taxes caused by nexus of the seller of the goods in the state 
sales to customers in such states may be taxable  but to date no such taxes have ever been collected by the company 
the company is not aware of any further extensions of this legislation but understands that more permanent application of the aforesaid internet tax freedom act is currently being discussed in the federal legislature and further extension has been recommended by the advisory commission on electronic commerce established by us congress to further review application of the statute 
the status of the prohibition is uncertain and states have attempted to impose sales and use tax  often successfully mainly based upon the nexus of the retailer with the state imposing the tax on customers in that state 
a number of proposals have been made at the state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
such proposals  if adopted and not in conflict with federal prohibitions  could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce  and could adversely affect the company s opportunity to derive financial benefit from such activities 
there has been recent activity in attempts to enforce the federal jenkins act which historically allowed state taxation of sales of goods made through use of the united states mails and is currently being reviewed toward possibly allowing the states to tax internet sales 

in addition  non us countries may seek to impose service tax such as value added tax collection obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate internet commerce 
a successful assertion by one or more states or any foreign country that the company should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise could impair its revenues and its ability to acquire and retain customers 
there may be significant security risks and privacy concerns relating to online commerce 
a significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
a compromise or breach of the technology used to protect the company s customers and their end users transaction data could result from  among other things  advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments 
any such compromise could have a material adverse effect on the company s reputation and  therefore  on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  a party who is able to circumvent the company s security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in its operations 
the company may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and other online services and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet and other online services generally  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
the company currently has practices and procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of its customers and their end users information 
however  its security procedures to protect against the risk of inadvertent disclosure or intentional breaches of security might fail to adequately protect information that it s obligated to keep confidential 
the company may not be successful in adopting more effective systems for maintaining confidential information  and its exposure to the risk of disclosure of the confidential information of others may grow with increases in the amount of information it possesses 
to the extent that the company activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage its reputation and expose it to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
the company s insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse it for losses caused by security breaches 
if the company s fulfillment centers are not effectively operated the company s business may be adversely affected 
if the company does not successfully operate its fulfillment centers such could significantly limit the company s ability to meet customer s demands  which would likely result in diminished revenues  adversely affecting the company s business 
because it is difficult to predict sales increases the company may not manage its facilities in an optimal way which may result in excess inventory  warehousing  fulfillment and distribution capacity having an adverse impact on working capital of the company  or the lack of sufficiency in such areas causing delays in fulfillment of customer orders adversely affecting customer confidence and loyalty 
the company s stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
the stock market  and in particular the market for internet related stocks  has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for the company s common stock to decline  perhaps substantially  including failure to meet its development plans  the demand for its common stock  downward revision in securities analyst s estimates or changes in general market conditions  technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  and investor perception of the company s industry or its prospects 
the company s stock pricing has fluctuated significantly in the past and there is no assurance such trend may not continue in the future
