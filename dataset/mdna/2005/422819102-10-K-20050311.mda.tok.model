executive overview our business we are a premier provider of executive search and leadership consulting services 
we help our clients build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment  development and retention of personnel for their executive management and board positions 
in addition to executive search  we provide other leadership services  including executive assessment and professional development and through an alliance executive coaching 
we provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of consultants located in countries throughout the world 
our executive search services are provided on a retained basis 
revenue before reimbursements of out of pocket expenses net revenue consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients 
typically  we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled 
in addition  if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation  we often will be authorized to bill the client for one third of the excess 
indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search 
our compensation model our compensation model closely aligns the interests of our consultants  our company and our shareholders 
consultants are rewarded for individual performance based on a system which directly ties compensation to the amount of net revenue for which the consultant is responsible 
actual compensation is adjusted  up or down  based on the company s performance against profitability targets approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
each quarter  we evaluate the expected annual performance of both the consultants and the company 
as annualized performance estimates are revised each quarter  compensation accruals are adjusted in each region 
as a result  the discretionary portion of compensation expense may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 

table of contents overview in  the global economy showed signs of recovery and favorably affected the demand for our services 
the recovery in europe was not as strong as in other regions of the world 
net revenue increased  or million in  compared to double digit increases were reported across all regions 
all of our industry practices experienced increases in net revenue with the exception of the industrial and higher education nonprofit practices which had modest declines 
consultant productivity increased as executive search revenue per consultant increased  to million in  compared to as a percent of net revenue  salary and employee benefits expense decreased to in from in general and administrative expenses were of net revenue in compared to in during the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our restructuring accruals and recorded million of restructuring charges to reflect changes in lease estimates primarily due to a tenant default on a sublease and the final determination and payment of certain severance related accruals 
during the third quarter of  we exercised warrants to purchase shares of common stock of google inc google which we received in in connection with recruitment fees  and subsequently sold all of the shares of common stock of google that we held resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
as a result of this warrant monetization  we recorded a realized gain of million  net of the consultants share of the gain 
historically  our policy with respect to warrants was that of the net proceeds resulting from the monetizations of warrants was payable to the consultants involved in the search 
for warrants received after february   the portion of the net proceeds payable to the consultants was reduced from to and is limited to million per monetization 
in addition  of the of the net proceeds we retain  or of the total net proceeds will be reserved for distribution to the broader employee population 
the effective tax rate was in  which is significantly lower than the statutory rate  primarily as a result of the partial reduction of the previously recorded valuation allowance related to net deferred tax assets associated with tax deductions that will be available for carryback to recover taxes paid in the current year and the utilization of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards 
we ended the year with a cash balance of million  an increase of million  compared to million at december  this increase is primarily as a result of the net proceeds of million from the sale of our shares of common stock of google offset by the portion of the consultants share of the gain that was paid in approximately million of the consultants share of the gain will be paid in outlook as we look forward to  we have numerous business and cost initiatives in place to help us improve revenue growth and operating margin 
an essential component to continued operating margin expansion in is a focus on raising profitability in europe 
although the european region reported operating income in  compared to an operating loss in  we have assembled a team of executives to focus on increasing profitability further in although we have not yet finalized our action plans  we expect to record restructuring charges of between million and million for severance and office closures and consolidations beginning in the second quarter of the restructuring charges relate primarily to the european region where initiatives are underway to improve operating margin in order to meet our profitability objectives 

table of contents results of operations we operate our executive search and complementary leadership services in four geographic regions north america  which includes the united states except miami and canada  latin america  which includes mexico and the rest of latin america  as well as miami  which serves as our gateway office to the region  europe  and asia pacific 
for segment purposes  reimbursements of out of pocket expenses classified as revenue are reported separately and therefore are not included in the net revenue by geographic region 
the company believes that analyzing trends in revenue before reimbursements net revenue and analyzing operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue more appropriately reflects the company s core operations

we incur certain out of pocket expenses that are reimbursed by our clients 
historically  we have not established a receivable for reimbursable expenses incurred but not yet billed as the amount was determined to be immaterial 
during the fourth quarter of  we enhanced our estimation technique related to reimbursable expenses resulting in a non recurring favorable impact to operating income of million 
we have accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate 
this change in accounting estimate is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods

the accruals for excess real estate were increased to reflect the expectation of longer vacancy periods due primarily to weakness in the real estate markets in which the leased properties are located 
the restructuring charges by segment are as follows north america million  europe million  and corporate million

interest income in was approximately million compared to million in the increase is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher returns on the invested cash 

table of contents we receive warrants for equity securities in client companies  in addition to the cash fee  for services rendered on some searches 
some of the warrants meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its subsequent amendments 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
these derivative instruments are initially recorded at their fair value  using the black scholes model  in the consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding amount recorded as net revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
compensation expense related to this net revenue is also recorded 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses  net of the consultants share of the gains losses 
other warrants received and which do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas no 
are initially recorded at their fair value  using the black scholes model  in the consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding amount recorded as net revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
compensation expense related to this net revenue is also recorded 
these warrants are accounted for using the cost method  and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized 
however  these warrants are regularly reviewed for other than temporary declines in fair value 
any permanent declines in the fair value of these warrants are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized losses  net of the consultants share of the losses 
upon a value event such as an initial public offering or an acquisition  any changes in the fair value of the warrants  both derivatives and non derivatives  are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses  net of the consultants share of the gains losses 
any equity securities arising from the exercise of a warrant are accounted for as available for sale investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these available for sale investments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
upon the sale of these investments  the company records a realized gain loss  net of the consultants share of the gain loss and other costs 
in  we received warrants to purchase  shares of class b common stock of google at a price of per share issued in connection with recruitment fees 
on august   we exercised the warrants pursuant to their cashless exercise feature and received  shares of google common stock 
in multiple transactions on september  and september   we sold all the shares of common stock of google that we held in ordinary brokerage transactions at an average price of less expenses associated with the transaction resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
during  we recognized realized gains of million  net of the consultants share of the gain and other costs  including million related to the monetization of our shares of common stock of google 
during  we recognized million of realized gains and less than million of unrealized gains  net of the consultants share of the gains and other costs  related to our equity and warrant portfolio 
net other non operating expense was million in compared to million in other non operating expense consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and which are not considered permanent in nature 
income taxes 
in  we had a pre tax loss of million and recorded income tax expense of million 
the income tax provision includes a non cash income tax expense of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of  to provide a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for the us and foreign operations which comprise the us income tax entity 

table of contents judgment is required in developing our income tax provision  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and recent financial performance 
in  and  we reported net losses  primarily due to restructuring activities necessary to align our cost structure with expected net revenue levels 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
in considering how the loss was created  evidence indicating that the loss was unusual  infrequent  or an aberration  rather than a continuing condition is an example of positive evidence that might support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence 
until the fourth quarter of  we considered the fact that the cumulative losses were primarily the result of the restructuring charges along with other positive evidence to be sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance was not needed 
however  when we recorded a restructuring charge totaling million in the fourth quarter of  management no longer felt it appropriate  for purposes of sfas no 
 to regard the restructuring charges as unusual  infrequent  or as an aberration  based on the number of restructuring charges recorded from through and the magnitude of the charge taken in the fourth quarter of as a result  the significant negative evidence of cumulative losses in recent years could not be overcome by other positive evidence  most of which was subjective in nature 
based upon the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded  in the fourth quarter of  a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the income tax expense recorded in also includes an expense of million  recorded in the first half of  to reduce certain deferred tax assets  representing the excess of expense for accounting purposes over the deduction for tax purposes  required to be recorded upon the vesting of restricted stock units 
in prior years  a portion of executive search consultant and management compensation was granted in restricted stock units at the then average market price of approximately per share 
this price served as the basis for the compensation expense and the related tax benefit and deferred tax asset 
the restricted stock units vested in at an average market price of approximately per share 
as this share price serves as the basis for the current tax deduction  we will realize a smaller tax benefit than initially recorded 
accordingly  we adjusted the deferred tax asset to reflect the lower tax benefit 
at the time we recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets  we anticipated that we would generate a loss for us income tax purposes in  due primarily to the timing of tax deductions related to restructuring charges recorded in prior years  and therefore did not anticipate recording or paying any us federal income tax in these tax estimates excluded the affects of any warrant monetizations due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of such transactions 
as a result of a significant warrant monetization in the third quarter of  we generated income in for us income tax purposes 
accordingly  we determined that a lesser valuation allowance is required related to net deferred tax assets associated with tax deductions that will be available for carryback to recover taxes paid in the current year and recorded a million reduction to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance 
in  the effective tax rate was  which is significantly lower than the statutory rate  primarily as a result of the partial reduction of the previously recorded valuation allowance relating to net deferred tax assets associated with tax deductions that will be available for carryback to recover taxes paid in the current year and the utilization of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards 
we anticipate that the effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate in the future due to the mix of earnings and profits in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
while the company expects to be profitable in and beyond  there is no assurance that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we determine a lesser allowance is required  we would record a reduction to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination

until the fourth quarter of  we considered the fact that the cumulative losses were primarily the result of the restructuring charges along with other positive evidence to be sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance was not needed 
however  when we recorded a restructuring charge totaling million in the fourth quarter of  management no longer felt it appropriate  for purposes of sfas no 
 to regard the restructuring charges as unusual  infrequent  or as an aberration  based on the number of restructuring charges recorded from through and the magnitude of the charge taken in the fourth quarter of as a result  the significant negative evidence of cumulative losses in recent years could not be overcome by other positive evidence  most of which was subjective in nature 
based upon the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded  in the fourth quarter of  a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the income tax expense recorded in also includes an expense of million  recorded in the first half of  to reduce certain deferred tax assets  representing the excess of expense for accounting purposes over the deduction for tax purposes  required to be recorded upon the vesting of restricted stock units 
in prior years  a portion of executive search consultant and management compensation was granted in restricted stock units at the then average market price of approximately per share 
this price served as the basis for the compensation expense and the related tax benefit and deferred tax asset 
the restricted stock units vested in at an average market price of approximately per share 
as this share price serves as the basis for the current tax deduction  we will realize a smaller tax benefit than initially recorded 
accordingly  we adjusted the deferred tax asset to reflect the lower tax benefit 

table of contents in  we had a pre tax loss of million and an income tax benefit of million 
the effective tax benefit rate in was  reflecting valuation allowances related to the recoverability of foreign tax credits  foreign net operating losses and other tax related allowances 
in addition  the income tax benefit in is reduced by approximately million of additional provision for income taxes in certain latin american subsidiaries 
the income tax provision and related current and deferred tax balances are more fully described in note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources general 
we continually evaluate our liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of capital resources based on our operating needs 
we believe that our existing cash balances together with the funds expected to be generated from operations and funds available under our committed line of credit will be sufficient to finance our operations for the foreseeable future  as well as to finance the cash payments associated with our restructuring charges 
we historically have paid a portion of our bonuses in december and the remainder in march 
employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on our performance and the performance of the individual employee 
our ability to undertake acquisitions may depend  in part  on access to additional funds 
in  we received warrants to purchase  shares of google at a price of per share issued in connection with recruitment fees 
on august   we exercised the warrants pursuant to their cashless exercise feature and received  shares of google common stock 
in multiple transactions on september  and september   we sold all the shares of common stock of google that we held in ordinary brokerage transactions at an average price of less expenses associated with the transaction resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
pursuant to the terms of our compensation policy with respect to warrants  of the net proceeds from these sales of shares of common stock of google is payable to our consultants involved with the search in the month following the monetization 
our current chief executive officer  thomas j 
friel  was a member of this search team and will receive of the consultants team share 
mr 
friel has elected to defer receipt of his share of the net proceeds until under an existing deferred compensation plan 
the remaining of the consultants team share of the net proceeds  approximately million  was paid in october we do not have material off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  trading activities of non exchange traded contracts or transactions with related parties 
some deferred compensation arrangements with certain employees  which were executed prior to july   are structured as forgivable loans 
the forgivable loans are accounted for as deferred compensation  and are therefore amortized to compensation expense over the forgiveness period 
at december   we had million of deferred compensation structured as forgivable loans  none of which were with any executive officer of the company 
lines of credit 
in december  the company entered into a million committed revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility replaced a million committed revolving credit facility and a million uncommitted credit facility 
under this facility  the company may borrow us dollars  euros  sterling and other major traded currencies  as agreed by the banks 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at the existing alternate base rate or libor plus a margin as determined by the company s compliance with certain tests of financial condition 
the facility has financial tests the company must meet or exceed relating to fixed charge coverage defined as consolidated ebitdar minus consolidated capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rental obligations plus restricted payments 
ebitdar is defined as earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rental expense plus interest income  
table of contents leverage defined as consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda plus interest income  current ratio defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  and net worth 
the facility sets limits on the company s ability to make acquisitions without bank approval and to incur additional debt outside of the facility 
the company must pay a facility fee whether or not the facility is used during the year 
in march  the company amended the facility to reduce the net worth covenant from million to million 
this amendment was required as a result of the non cash income tax expense of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of  which provided a full valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets related to the us and foreign operations which comprise the us income tax entity 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the lines of credit existing at december  or december   nor were there any borrowings during the years ended december  and  respectively  under the then existing lines of credit 
at december   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the facility  and no event of default existed 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  an increase of million  compared to million at december  cash from operating activities 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  primarily as a result of our net income adjusted for non cash items  offset by payments related to the restructuring charges 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  reflecting our net loss  adjusted for non cash items  a million reduction of net income taxes recoverable  which includes the refund of approximately million of us income taxes paid in prior years arising from the carryback of net operating losses  partially offset by payments related to our restructuring charges and payments of bonuses in march and december in  cash provided by operating activities was million  reflecting our net loss adjusted for non cash items  a reduction of our trade receivables  and the million reduction of net income taxes recoverable  which includes the refund of approximately million of us income taxes paid in prior years arising from the carryback of net operating losses to prior years and the recovery of estimated taxes paid in the first half of  partially offset by the payments related to our restructuring charges and payment of bonuses in march and december cash from investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities was million in primarily as a result of the net proceeds of million from the sale of our shares of common stock of google offset by the portion of the consultants share of the gain which was paid in cash used in investing activities was million in and million in primarily due to capital expenditures  partially offset by net proceeds from sales of equity securities 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were primarily for computer equipment and software 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million to million

a portion of the consultants share of the gain related to the sale of equity securities in  approximately million  will be paid in 
table of contents cash from financing activities 
cash from financing activities was million in cash used in financing activities was million in and million in the cash from financing activities in was primarily the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by repurchases of our common stock 
the cash used in financing activities in and is primarily for repurchases of our common stock and payments on debt related to acquisitions of executive search firms 
the repurchases of our common stock in and were made in accordance with the march  board of directors authorization for management to repurchase up to an aggregate of million shares of our common stock with an aggregate purchase price up to million through march  from february  through march   we repurchased  shares of common stock for million 
during  we purchased  shares of common stock for million 
on may   our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to an aggregate of million shares of our common stock with an aggregate purchase price up to million through may  no purchases of our common stock were made under this authorization 
on october   our board of directors authorized management to repurchase shares of our common stock with an aggregate purchase price up to million 
also at this time  the previous authorization to purchase up to million through may  was cancelled 
we have purchased  shares of our common stock for million under this authorization through december  contractual obligations

see note  significant warrant monetization  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the contractual obligations included in the above table  we have liabilities related to certain employee benefit plans 
these liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at december  the obligations related to these employee benefit plans are described in note  employee benefit plans  and note  pension plan and life insurance contract 
as the timing of cash disbursements related to these employee benefit plans is uncertain  we have not included these obligations in the above table 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates general 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue before reimbursements for out of pocket expenses net revenue is recognized when earned and realizable and therefore when the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b services have been rendered  c the fee to our client is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
net revenue consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients 
typically  we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one third of the estimated first year compensation of the position to be filled 
if actual compensation of the placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation  we are generally authorized to bill the client for one third of the excess 
net revenue from executive search engagements is recognized over the expected average period of performance  in proportion to the estimated personnel time incurred to fulfill our obligations under the arrangements 
net revenue in excess of the retainer  resulting from actual compensation of the placed candidate exceeding estimated compensation  is recognized upon completion of the executive search when the amount of the additional fee is known 
our assumptions about the duration of the time and extent of efforts for search teams to complete our services in an executive search engagement require significant judgment as these variables have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
these assumptions are updated annually or whenever conditions exist to indicate that more frequent updates are necessary 
accruals related to the consolidation and closing of offices recorded as part of our restructuring charges 
in  we began the restructuring of our business to better align costs with expected net revenue levels 
these initiatives included the consolidation and closing of offices where we had long term leases 
at the time of the office closings and consolidations  we accrued the estimated costs associated with these actions 
for initiatives which were announced prior to january   the accruals were established in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
for cost reduction initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of  the accruals were established in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
inherent in these accruals are estimates concerning vacancy periods  expected sublease income  and costs to terminate the leases 
these accruals are periodically updated to reflect information concerning the commercial real estate markets in which the offices are located 
during  we recorded million of restructuring 
table of contents charges to increase accruals for leased properties that had been identified as excess in previous office consolidation charges 
during  we recorded million of restructuring charges to reflect changes in lease estimates primarily due to a tenant default on a sublease and the final determination and payment of certain severance related restructuring accruals 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to accruals for the consolidation and closing of offices is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to changes in the commercial real estate markets and the local regional economic factors where this leased office space is located 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
judgment is required in developing our income tax provision  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and recent financial performance 
we reported net losses in  and  primarily as a result of recording restructuring charges in connection with aligning our cost structure with expected net revenue levels 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
in considering how the loss was created  evidence indicating that the loss was unusual  infrequent  or an aberration  rather than a continuing condition is an example of positive evidence that might support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence 
until the fourth quarter of  we considered the fact that the cumulative losses were primarily the result of the restructuring charges along with other positive evidence to be sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance was not needed 
however  when we recorded a restructuring charge totaling million in the fourth quarter of  management no longer felt it appropriate  for purposes of sfas no 
 to regard the restructuring charges as unusual  infrequent  or as an aberration  based on the number of restructuring charges recorded in the last three years and the magnitude of the charge taken in the fourth quarter of as a result  the significant negative evidence of cumulative losses in recent years could not be overcome by other positive evidence  most of which was subjective in nature 
based upon the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded  in the fourth quarter of  a non cash income tax expense of million  providing a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for the us and foreign operations which comprise the us income tax entity 
at the time we recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets  we anticipated that we would generate a loss in for us income tax purposes  due primarily to the timing of tax deductions related to restructuring charges recorded in prior years  and therefore did not anticipate recording or paying any us federal income tax in these tax estimates excluded the affects of any warrant monetizations due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of such transactions 
as a result of a significant warrant monetization in the third quarter of  we generated income in for us income tax purposes 
accordingly  we determined that a lesser valuation allowance is required related to net deferred tax assets associated with tax deductions that will be available for carryback to recover taxes paid in the current year and recorded a million reduction to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance 
we anticipate that the effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate in the future due to the mix of earnings and profits in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
while the company expects to be profitable in and beyond  there is no assurance that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we determine a lesser 
table of contents allowance is required  we would record a reduction to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to our income tax provision  deferred tax assets and liabilities and income taxes payable and recoverable is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to our ability to generate taxable income in future years and to adequately provide for potential income tax related liabilities 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill of the reporting unit would be considered impaired 
to measure the amount of the impairment loss  the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill shall be determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
the fair value of each of the company s reporting units was determined using a combination of valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company methodology  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
the discounted cash flow approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  capital investments  appropriate discount rates  certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities  and other variables to calculate the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
these assumptions are updated annually  at a minimum  to reflect information concerning our reportable segments 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  is recognized 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of our reportable segments 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable from our customers are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable balances 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts through an analysis of several factors  including the aging of our accounts receivable  historical write off experience  and specific account analyses 
we consider current and projected economic conditions and historical trends when determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from our estimates due to changes in future economic or industry conditions or specific customers financial condition

currency market risk 
with our operations primarily in north america  latin america  europe and asia pacific we conduct business using various currencies 
revenue earned in each country is generally matched with the associated expenses incurred  thereby reducing currency risk to earnings 
however  because certain assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  changes in currency rates may cause fluctuations in the valuation of such assets and liabilities 
as the local currency of our subsidiaries has been designated as the functional currency  we are affected by the translation of foreign currency financial statements into us dollars
