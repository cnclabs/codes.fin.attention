item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reclassification of amounts certain reclassifications of prior fiscal quarters financial information have been made to conform with current fiscal quarter presentation 
overview operational overview 
we are a leading distributor of professional grade test  measurement  and calibration equipment and provider of nationally recognized and accredited calibration services across a wide array of measurement disciplines 
we operate our business through two reportable business segments that offer different products and services to the same customer base 
those two segments are distribution products and calibration services 
in our distribution segment  our master catalog is widely recognized by both original equipment manufacturers and customers as the ultimate source for test and measurement equipment 
additionally  because we specialize in test and measurement equipment  as opposed to a wide array of industrial products  our sales and customer service personnel can provide value added technical assistance to our customers to assist them in determining what product best meets their particular application requirements 
our strength in our calibration services segment is based upon our wide range of disciplines and our investment in the quality systems that are required in our targeted market segments 
our services range from the calibration of a single unit to managing a customer s entire calibration program 
our revenue in our distribution products segment can be heavily impacted by changes in the economic environment 
as industrial customers increase or curtail capital and discretionary spending  our product sales will typically be directly impacted 
absent significant economic volatility  we do not see this segment of our business as high growth 
the majority of our products are not consumables but are purchased as replacements  upgrades  or for expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities 
year over year sales growth in any one quarter can be impacted by a number of factors including the addition of new product lines or channels of distribution 
we believe our calibration services segment offers considerable growth opportunity and the potential for continuing revenue from established customers from what is typically an annual calibration cycle 
we evaluate sales growth in both of our business segments against a four quarter trend analysis  not by analyzing any single quarter 
financial overview 
our distribution products segment benefited in fiscal year from a stronger economy  and  year over year sales growth was stronger in the first half of the year due to weaker prior year comparisons 
calibration service sales continued to improve in comparison to the prior year  as the year progressed  as our sales organization identified and closed new business 
our gross margin overall was consistent with the prior year 
our distribution products segment gross margin declined approximately four points over the first six months of the year  compared to the prior year  as a result of prior year initiatives of selling into new low margin market segments increased promotional and pricing activity 

table of contents over the last six months of fiscal year our product gross profit increased approximately three points as we decreased our use of promotional pricing in response to the strengthened economy 
we are pleased with our consistent calibration services gross profit margin resulting from our focus on expense control and productivity improvements 
calibration sales growth offers significant leverage on gross profit due to the relatively fixed nature of a calibration laboratory cost structure  as evidenced by our fourth quarter results 
critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting principles or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of our consolidated financial statements includes a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of our most critical accounting policies follows use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  depreciable lives of assets  estimated lives of our master catalog  and tax valuation allowances 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following table summarizes the more significant charges in the consolidated statements of operations that require management estimates  which are described below in millions for the years ended march  march  march  provision for doubtful accounts receivables and returns depreciation of property  plant  and equipment amortization of master catalog costs deferred tax valuation allowance provisions changes in estimates in the ordinary course of accounting for items discussed above  we make changes in estimates as appropriate  and as we become aware of circumstances surrounding those estimates 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and  if material  their effects are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales are recorded when products are shipped or services are rendered to customers  as we generally have no significant post delivery obligations 
our prices are fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and returns are reasonably estimated 
provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded based upon historical data 
we recognize the majority of our service revenue based upon when the calibration or repair activity is performed then shipped and or delivered to the customer 
some of our service revenue is generated from managing customers calibration programs in which we recognize revenue in equal amounts at fixed intervals 
our shipments are generally free on board shipping point and our customers are generally invoiced for freight  shipping  and handling charges 
accounts receivable accounts receivable represent receivables from customers in the ordinary course of business 
these amounts are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns in the consolidated balance sheets 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the expected collectibility of accounts 
table of contents receivable 
we apply a specific formula to our accounts receivable aging  which may be adjusted on a specific account basis where the specific formula may not appropriately reserve for loss exposure 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the returns reserve is calculated based upon the historical rate of returns applied to sales over a specific timeframe 
the returns reserve will increase or decrease as a result of changes in the level of sales and or the historical rate of returns 
inventories inventories consist of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market 
costs are determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
inventories are reduced by a reserve for items not saleable at or above standard cost 
we reserve specifically for certain items of our inventory and  for other items  we apply a specific loss factor  based on historical experience  to specific categories of our inventory 
we evaluate the adequacy of the reserve on a regular basis 
properties  depreciation  and amortization properties are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization is computed primarily under the straight line method with useful lives of to years for the following major classifications machinery  equipment  software  and furniture and fixtures 
properties determined to have no value are written off at their then remaining net book value 
we account for software costs in accordance with statement of position fsp no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
leasehold improvements are amortized under the straight line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure 
goodwill we estimate the fair value of our reporting units in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other tangible assets  using the fair market value measurement requirement  rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach 
we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded an impairment from the implementation of sfas no 
as a million change in accounting principle based upon our determination of the fair market value of the reporting units 
the evaluation of our reporting units on a fair value basis indicated that no additional impairment existed as of march   march   and march  deferred catalog costs we amortize the cost of each master catalog mailed over such catalog s estimated productive life 
we review response results from catalog mailings on a continuous basis  and if warranted  modify the period over which costs are recognized 
we amortize the cost of each master catalog over an eighteen month period and amortize the cost of each catalog supplement over a three month period 
total deferred catalog costs were million at march  and march  deferred gain on tpg as a result of certain post divestiture commitments  we are unable to recognize the gain of million on the divestiture of tpg  which took place in fiscal year  until those commitments expire in fiscal year see note of our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure 
deferred taxes we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is provided for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure 
stock options we follow the provisions of accounting practice board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which does not require compensation costs related to stock options to be recorded in net income  as all options granted under the stock option plan had on exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at grant date

in fiscal year  as the business climate improved  we targeted a reduction in those allowances 
in addition  our product gross profit ratio to sales can be impacted by a number of factors that can impact quarterly and annual comparisons 
among those factors are sales to certain channels that do not support the margins of our core customer base  periodic rebates on purchases and cooperative advertising received from suppliers and reported as a reduction of cost of sales in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf see note to our consolidated financial statements

provides guidance under sfas  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas fsp has no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas in november  fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 

this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
this statement is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board toward development of a single set of high quality accounting standards 
this clarification has no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas r on december   the fasb issued sfas no

however  sfas permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb no 
 as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas r requires the cost of all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements  establishes fair value as the measurement objective and requires entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions 
sfas r applies to all awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after july   and unvested portions of previously issued and outstanding awards 

table of contents the sec amended the effective date of sfas r with a new rule issued on april  to amend the compliance date for sfas r that allows companies to implement sfas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period  that begins after june   although early adoption is allowed 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas the company currently expects to adopt sfas r effective march   however  the company has not yet determined which of the aforementioned adoption methods it will use 
the company has not changed any of the stock compensation plans as a result of the impending adoption of sfas r but maintains the right to amend  suspend or terminate any plan at any time 
sfas on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company currently expects to adopt sfas effective on july  and does not expect that the adoption will have an effect on its consolidated financial statements

operating expenses are targeted to grow in line with sales 
increases are planned in the following areas marketing for prospecting and promotion  employee training on new products  customer satisfaction surveys  and infrastructure investments  mainly information technology 
operating earnings are targeted to increase as a result of gross margin improvement and should increase as a percentage of sales 
manpower increases and capital expenditures are devoted primarily to calibration services and are tied to increased volume or replacement improvement of equipment 
distribution products should grow in the low single digits in a stable economy 
our growth in any quarter could be higher as a result of our sales of new product lines added in late fiscal year and early fiscal year calibration services revenues should grow in the high single digits as more companies outsource their total calibration management to transcat 
growth in any quarter could be higher or lower based on the timing and size of the new business 
as previously disclosed  we have had a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets providing for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance 
the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent three year fiscal period ending march  is sufficient negative evidence to maintain the valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas no 
our results over the most recent three year period were heavily affected by such charges as severance  restructuring  litigation  and directors compensation expenses 
although we believe that the company today is much stronger  more profitable  and focused on operating a sound  profitable business model  we must maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reduction or reversal

risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks and all other information included in this form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this form k are not the only ones facing our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment 
general economic conditions 
the electronic instrumentation distribution industry is affected by changes in economic conditions  which are outside our control 
we cannot assure you that economic slowdowns  adverse economic conditions or cyclical trends in certain customer markets will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition  or our ability to meet our commitments 
dependence on manufacturers 
a significant amount of our inventory purchases are made from one vendor group 
our reliance on this vendor group leaves us vulnerable to having an inadequate supply of required products  price increases  late deliveries  and poor product quality 
like other distributors in our industry  we occasionally experience supply shortages and are unable to purchase our desired volume of products 
if we are unable to enter into and maintain satisfactory distribution arrangements with leading manufacturers  if we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of products  or if manufacturers do not regularly invest in  introduce to us  and or make available to us for distribution new products  our sales could suffer considerably 
finally  we cannot provide any assurance that particular products  or product lines  will be available to us  or available in quantities 
table of contents sufficient to meet customer demand 
this is of particular significance to our business because the products we sell are often only available from one source 
any limits to product access could materially and adversely affect our business 
indebtedness 
in november  we entered a third amendment to our existing agreement with our secured credit facility 
this amendment resulted in two additional term loans  in addition to our revolving line of credit 
as of march   we owed million to our secured creditor 
we are required to meet financial tests on a quarterly basis and comply with other covenants customary in secured financings 
although we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with such covenants  if we do not remain in compliance with such covenants  our lenders may demand immediate repayment of amounts outstanding 
changes in interest rates may have a significant effect on our monthly payment obligations and operating results 
furthermore  we are dependent on credit from manufacturers of our products to fund our inventory purchases 
if our debt burden increases to high levels  such manufacturers may restrict our credit 
our cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the rate of growth of our sales  the timing and levels of products purchased  payment terms  and credit limits from manufacturers  the timing and level of our accounts receivable collections and our ability to manage our business profitably 
our ability to satisfy our existing obligations  whether or not under our secured credit facility  will depend upon our future operating performance  which may be impacted by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  and other factors described in this form k  many of which are beyond our control 
if existing shareholders sell large numbers of shares of our common stock  our stock price could decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing shareholders or holders of stock options of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile 
the stock market from time to time  has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are both related and unrelated to the operating performance of companies 
as our stock may be affected by market volatility  as well as by our own performance  the following factors  among others  may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock developments in our relationships with current or future manufacturers of products we distribute  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  litigation or governmental proceedings or announcements involving us or our industry  economic and other external factors  such as disasters or other crises  sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market  period to period fluctuations in our operating results  and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
we expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate 
such fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 
a large portion of our expenses for calibration services  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel  are relatively fixed  as is our commitment to purchase a predetermined amount of inventory 
accordingly  if revenues decline or do not grow as we anticipate  we may not be able to correspondingly reduce our operating expenses in any particular quarter 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
if our operating results in some quarters fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  our stock price would likely decline 
some of the factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate include fluctuations in industrial demand for products we sell and or services we provide  and fluctuations in geographic conditions  including currency and other economic conditions 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to achieve our stated corporate objectives 
our ability to manage our anticipated growth  if realized  effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers and technical personnel 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified individuals  we will not be able to achieve our stated corporate objectives
