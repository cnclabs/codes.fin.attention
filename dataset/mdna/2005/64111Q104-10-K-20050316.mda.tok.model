item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements are not historical facts  but rather are based on current expectations  estimates  assumptions and projections about our industry  business and future financial results 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed below under risk factors affecting future results 
overview we design  develop and market technologically advanced  branded networking products that address the specific needs of small business and home users 
we supply innovative networking products that meet the ease of use  quality  reliability  performance and affordability requirements of these users 
from our inception in january until may  our operating activities related primarily to research and development  developing relationships with outsourced design  manufacturing and technical support partners  testing prototype designs  staffing a sales and marketing organization and establishing relationships with distributors and resellers 
we began product shipments during the quarter ended june   and recorded net revenue of million in in  our net revenue was million and our net income was million 
our products are grouped into three major product lines within the small business and home markets ethernet networking products  broadband products and wireless networking products 
ethernet networking products include switches  network interface cards  or nics  and print servers 
broadband products include routers and gateways 
wireless networking products include wireless access points  wireless nics and media adapters 
these products are available in multiple configurations to address the needs of our customers in each geographic region in which our products are sold 
our products are sold through multiple sales channels worldwide  including traditional retailers  online retailers  direct market resellers  or dmrs  value added resellers  or vars  and  broadband service providers 
our retail channel includes traditional retail locations domestically and internationally  such as best buy  circuit city  compusa  costco  fry s electronics  office max  staples  mediamarkt germany  austria  pc world uk and fnac france 
online retailers include amazon 
com  newegg 
com and buy 
com 
our direct market resellers include cdw corporation  insight corporation and pc connection in domestic markets and misco throughout europe 
in addition  we also sell our products through broadband service providers  such as comcast  charter communications and time warner cable  in domestic markets and strato ag germany  tiscali germany  aol uk  telewest uk  tele denmark  and telstra australia 
some of these retailers and resellers purchase directly from us while most are fulfilled through wholesale distributors around the world 
a substantial portion of our net revenue to date has been derived from a limited number of wholesale distributors  the largest of which are ingram micro inc and tech data corporation 
we expect that these wholesale distributors will continue to contribute a significant percentage of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 

table of contents the table below sets forth the percentage of net revenue derived from these major wholesale distributors for the years ended december   and  respectively 
year ended december  ingram micro  inc tech data corporation total we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from international sales 
international sales as a percentage of net revenue grew from in to in and in sales in emea grew from million in to million in  representing an increase of approximately during that period 
we continue to penetrate growing markets such as china  italy  japan  spain and sweden 
the table below sets forth our net revenue by major geographic region 
year ended december  percentage percentage change change in thousands united states emea asia pacific and rest of world total our net revenue consists of gross product shipments  less allowances for estimated returns for stock rotation and warranty  price protection  customer rebates  cooperative marketing expenses deemed to be a sales incentive and net changes in deferred revenue 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
currently  for some of our international customers  title passes upon delivery to the port of destination 
for select retailers to whom we sell directly  title passes upon their receipt of product or upon our customer s resale of the product 
at the end of each quarter  we defer revenue related to the product in transit to some of our international customers and retail customers that purchase directly from us and for which title and risk of loss have not passed to the customer  and distributor and reseller channel inventory that we estimate may be returned to us under their stock rotation rights 
our financial condition and results of operations have been and are likely to continue to be affected by seasonal patterns 
in the past  we have experienced higher net revenue during the second half of the year  with our highest net revenue during the year end holiday season 
absent other factors  we would therefore expect higher net revenue in the third and fourth quarter of each year 
to the extent our retail sales increase as a percentage of our net revenue  we expect to experience seasonally higher net revenue as a percentage of annual net revenue in the third and fourth quarters 
intense competition and technological advances characterize the small business and home networking markets 
as a result  we expect to experience rapid erosion of average selling prices over the course of the lifecycle of our products due to competitive pricing pressures 
in order to maintain our margins  it is necessary to offset average sales price erosion by negotiating continuously with component suppliers and contract manufacturers to reduce unit costs of incoming inventory 
we also expect to continue to introduce new products and broaden our geographic and channel reach 
these efforts require significant up front investment in advance of incremental revenue  which could impact our margins 
in addition  our international expansion may expose us to additional risks related to foreign currency fluctuations 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the following the cost of finished products from our third party contract manufacturers  overhead costs including purchasing  product planning  inventory control  warehous 
table of contents ing and distribution logistics  and freight  warranty and write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
we outsource our manufacturing  warehousing and distribution logistics 
we believe this outsourcing strategy allows us to better manage our product costs and gross margin 
our gross margin is affected by other factors  including changes in net revenues due to average selling prices  marketing expenses such as promotional activities and rebate redemptions  and changes in our cost of goods sold due to fluctuations in warranty and overhead costs  prices paid for components  net of vendor rebates  freight and charges excess or obsolete inventory caused by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes and transitions from older to newer products 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  payments to suppliers for design services  tooling  safety and regulatory testing  product certification expenditures to qualify our products for sale into specific markets  and other consulting fees and product certification fees paid to third parties 
research and development expenses are recognized as they are incurred 
we have invested in building our research and development organization to allow us to introduce innovative and easy to use products 
we expect to continue to add additional employees in our research and development department 
in the future we believe that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand into new hardware and software networking product technologies  enhance the ease of use of our products and broaden our core competencies 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising  trade shows  corporate communications and other marketing expenses  personnel expenses for sales and marketing staff  product marketing expenses and technical support expenses 
we believe that maintaining and building brand awareness is key to both net revenue growth and maintaining our gross margin 
we also believe that maintaining widely available and high quality technical support is key to building and maintaining brand awareness 
accordingly  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future  related to the planned growth of our business 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and accounting  human resources and management information systems personnel  professional fees  bad debt provision  and other corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional expenses related to the growth of our business and continued operations as a public company 
we recorded  as a component of stockholders equity on our balance sheet  deferred stock based compensation of million and million relating to certain stock options granted to employees during the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we eliminated  of this deferred stock based compensation as a result of forfeitures of certain of the awards that gave rise to the deferred stock based compensation in and we are amortizing this deferred stock based compensation over the four year vesting period of the stock options and such amounts are allocated to the respective operating expense categories based upon individual employee departments 
interest income represents amounts earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense consists of interest paid on loans  and beginning in february  included imputed interest associated with a note payable to nortel networks 
the note had a principal amount of million  with principal and accrued but unpaid interest due on february  interest on the note  at per year  was due to start accruing on february  the note was carried at its then present value and we were accreting its carrying value to reflect its imputed interest 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in august to fully repay the note 
as a result of this million cash payment  we incurred an extinguishment of debt charge of approximately million in the quarter ended september  when the note was repaid in full 
other expense  net  primarily represents gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and other miscellaneous expenses 
we incurred net losses in each year from our inception in through as we invested in building our research and development capabilities  our sales channels and staff  and our operations and financial infrastructure 
we accumulated a deficit of million during this time period 
in we earned net income of million primarily due to growth in revenue of million 
in we incurred a net loss of 
table of contents million primarily due to excess inventory levels brought about by the overall weak economic conditions in the networking markets we serve 
we were again profitable in and  with net income of million and million  respectively  due to increased revenue and improved gross margins 
in we had net income of million and our net revenue increased compared with and gross margin increased from in to in we believe our future results will be dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the markets we serve  the competitive environment in which we operate  and our ability to successfully implement our strategy  among other things

for the year ended december  revenue generated within north america  emea and asia pacific was  and  respectively 
the comparable net revenue for the year ended december  was  and  respectively 
the increase in net revenue over the prior year comparable period for each region was  and  respectively 
the increase in all regions was attributable to increased shipment of broadband and wireless products and ethernet switches  due in part to the continuous introduction of new products into all channels 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our gross margin improved to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this improvement in gross 
table of contents margin of was due primarily to a favorable shift in product mix and relatively lower product costs  as well as operational efficiency and supply chain management 
we also earned rebates and prompt payment discounts from our suppliers  which increased million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an improvement of in gross margin 
these improvements in gross margin were partially offset by an increase in cooperative marketing costs and end user rebates  as well as additional provisions to write down inventory resulting from anticipated warranty returns 
cooperative marketing costs and end user rebates are recorded as a reduction in net revenue 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased product development costs of  and increased salary and payroll related expenses of  resulting from research and development related headcount growth  as evidenced by our opening of our engineering center in taiwan which accounted for nine additional employees  representing of our worldwide research and development staff as of december  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was due to product promotion  advertising  outside technical support expenses incurred in support of the increased sales volume  and increased operating costs in international locations due to the weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro and the british pound 
in addition  salary and related expenses for additional sales and marketing personnel increased by million resulting from sales and marketing related headcount growth  especially due to expansion in the emea and asia pacific regions  and freight out charges increased by million primarily in support of higher revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased director and officer insurance costs of  and fees for professional services aggregating million 
professional services fees consisted of systems consulting  accounting  excluding sarbanes oxley audit fees  and legal fees 
there were also additional costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance of million and an increase in employee related costs of million 
the increase in employee related costs resulted from an increase in general and administrative related headcount  particularly in the finance and information systems departments  and also included employment taxes resulting from the exercise of stock options 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
during the year ended december   we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  in cost of revenue   in research and development expenses   in sales and marketing expenses  and  in general and administrative expenses 
this compared to  in cost of revenue   in research and development expenses   in sales and marketing expenses and  in general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  the remaining deferred stock based compensation balance of million will be fully amortized by the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year ending december  interest income  interest expense and other expense  net the aggregate of interest income  interest expense  and other expense  net  amounted to a net other income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net expense of  for the year ended december  this change was primarily due to a decrease of  in imputed interest expense associated with the nortel networks note  following the repayment of the note in august  as well as an additional million in interest income for the year ended december   from the investment of our cash balance throughout the year 
this was offset in part by an increase in other expenses of  consisting primarily of realized and unrealized losses associated with foreign currency denominated transactions 

table of contents extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  we used million of the proceeds from our initial public offering to repay debt that had a carrying value of million 
the repayment of debt resulted in the recognition of an extinguishment of debt charge of million in the third quarter of due to the acceleration of interest expense equal to the unamortized discounted balance at the date of repayment 
there was no such charge taken in the year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes provision for income taxes increased million  to a provision of million for the year ended december   from a benefit of million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately and differed from our statutory rate of approximately due to non deductible stock based compensation  state taxes  and other non deductible expenses  offset in part by a million tax benefit from exercises of stock options and tax credits 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  the principal reason for the income tax benefit in this period was the reversal of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million offset by provisions on taxable income including state taxes 
the million charge recorded in for extinguishment of debt was non deductible for tax purposes 
net income net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in gross profit of million  the absence of a million extinguishment of debt charge that was taken in the prior year  and an increase in interest income  interest expense and other expense  net  of million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in provision for income taxes of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross shipments of our existing products and to the introduction of various new products that were favorably received by customers 
in particular  net revenue in the emea region grew by million or  year over year 
this increase was partially offset by a million increase in rebates and cooperative marketing costs primarily  in north america  associated with increased product sales 
net revenue for the years ended december  and was reduced for cooperative marketing expenses in the amount of million and million  respectively  deemed to be sales incentives under emerging issues task force eitf cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our gross margin improved to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix  especially of newer products  which often carry higher gross margins  as well as due to operational efficiency and supply chain management programs that reduced inbound freight costs by million and excess and absolute inventory charges by approximately million 
furthermore  we were able to negotiate better pricing with our contract manufacturers and chip vendors due to increased volumes 

table of contents operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased headcount and salary increases for existing employees of million  general overhead increases of approximately  offset by  in lower product development costs  which include product certification costs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to i million in increased expenses related to the addition of sales and marketing personnel and salary increases for existing employees  ii increased sales volume  product promotion  advertising and outside technical support expenses of million  and  iii freight out charges of million 
furthermore  we incurred additional costs associated with entering new and expanding our presence in markets such as china  italy  japan  spain and sweden 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cost associated with operating as a public company  including increased directors and officers insurance of  and professional services of  comprised of systems consulting  accounting and legal fees 
this increase was offset by reduced payroll expenses of approximately  mainly as a result of lower bonus payments 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
during the year ended december   we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  in cost of revenue   in research and development expenses   in sales and marketing expenses  and  in general and administrative expenses 
this compared to  in cost of revenue   in research and development expenses   in sales and marketing expenses and  in general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  the remaining balance of deferred stock based compensation of million will continue to be amortized on a straight line basis until interest income  interest expense and other income expense  net the aggregate of interest income  interest expense  and other income expense  net  decreased  to a net expense of  for the year ended december   from a net expense of million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to increased interest income of  due to an increase in the average cash balance 
additionally  interest expense was reduced by  following the repayment of the nortel note 
extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  we used million of the proceeds from our initial public offering to repay debt that had a carrying value of million 
the repayment of debt resulted in the recognition of an extinguishment of debt charge of million in the third quarter of due to the acceleration of interest expense equal to the unamortized discounted balance at the date of repayment 
provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million for the year ended december   compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  this benefit was primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million recorded in the second quarter of the valuation allowance was reversed because we determined that it is more likely than not that certain future tax benefits will be realized 
this tax benefit was partially offset by provisions on taxable income 
the million charge recorded in for extinguishment of debt was non deductible for tax purposes 
the year ended december  included a benefit associated with a change in 
table of contents the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million  arising from  among other factors  the utilization of net operating loss tax carry forwards 
net income net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in gross profit of million  a benefit in the income tax provision of million  offset by a charge for the extinguishment of debt  related to a note payable to nortel networks  of million and an increase in operating expenses of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased from million as of december  to million as of december  operating activities during the year ended december  generated cash of million 
investing activities during the year ended december  used million primarily for the net purchase of short term investments of million and purchases of property and equipment amounting to million 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided million  primarily resulting from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program 
our days sales outstanding decreased from days as of december  to days as of december  this decrease was attributable primarily to changes in geographical and channel mix as well as improved collections 
our accounts payable increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase of million is due to the timing of inventory receipts including inventory that is in transit from our vendors as of december  the increase in in transit inventory is to support the revenue growth 
inventory grew by million from million at december  to million at december   to support increased product shipments to customers 
the primary areas of growth were finished goods of million and in transit inventory of million 
in the quarter ended december  we experienced inventory turns of approximately times  down from approximately times in the quarter ended december  based on our current plans and market conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we cannot be certain that our planned levels of revenue  costs and expenses will be achieved 
if our operating results fail to meet our expectations or if we fail to manage our inventory  accounts receivable or other assets  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in addition  as we continue to expand our product offerings  channels and geographic presence  we may require additional working capital 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable or commercially acceptable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
backlog as of december   we had a backlog of approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and which are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment 
while we expect to fulfill the order backlog within the current year  most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with little or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in product scheduling or 
table of contents order cancellation  our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of net sales for any succeeding period 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations and our off balance sheet arrangements in cash as of december  payments due by period less than more than year years years years total in thousands operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations we lease office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through january rent expense was  for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the terms of the facility lease provide for rental payments on a graduated scale 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period  and have accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid 
we enter into various inventory related purchase agreements with suppliers 
generally  under these agreements  of the orders are cancelable by giving notice to days prior to the expected shipment date and of orders are cancelable by giving notice days prior to the expected shipment date 
orders are not cancelable within days prior to the expected shipment date 
at december   we had approximately million in non cancelable purchase commitments with suppliers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements including those related to sales returns and allowances  bad debt  inventory reserves  vendor rebates and deferred taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  underlying run rates and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following are critical judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
currently  for some of our international customers  title passes upon delivery to the port of destination and for select retailers in the united states to whom we sell directly title passes upon their receipt of product or upon our customer s resale of the product 
at the end of each quarter  we estimate and defer revenue related to the product that is in transit to some international customers and retail customers in the united states that purchase direct from us for which title and risk of loss have not passed to the customer 
we use an estimated number of days based on historical transit periods for different geographies to estimate the amount of revenue to be deferred 
in addition  we monitor distributor and reseller channel inventory levels to identify any excess inventory in the channel that may be subject to stock rotation rights for us customers only 
gross revenue is reduced for estimated returns for stock rotation and warranty  price protection programs  customer rebates and cooperative 
table of contents marketing expenses deemed to be a sales incentive under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  to derive net revenue 
at the time of each sales transaction  we assess whether collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess collectibility and creditworthiness of our customer s based on a number of factors  including past transaction history  independent reports from recognized credit rating bureaus  financial statements of the customer and where appropriate  interviews and discussions held with senior financial management of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue until receipt of cash 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different if our management made different judgments and estimates 
allowances for returns due to stock rotation and warranty  price protection programs  other sales incentives and doubtful accounts management makes estimates of potential future product returns  price protection claims and other sales incentives related to current period revenue 
such estimates are based on amount and timing of historical returns or claims rates  channel inventory levels  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments and estimates 
we evaluate our ability to collect our receivables based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our significant customer accounts  and  when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record allowance for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
as of december   we have provided allowances for a total of million for doubtful accounts  million for price protection  and million for sales returns 
after applying these allowances to our gross accounts receivable balance of million  we had million in net accounts receivable outstanding as of december  we also have provided for allowances for warranty returns in the amount of million as december   which is included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
end user customer rebates we record estimated reductions to revenues for end user customer rebates at the later of when the related revenue is recognized  or when the program is offered to the end consumer 
often qualified purchasers choose not to apply for the incentives or fail to follow the required redemption guidelines  resulting in an incentive redemption rate of less than 
based on historical data  we estimate a rebate redemption rate for our promotional programs and book the related reduction to revenue accordingly 
should actual redemption rates differ from our estimates  revision to net revenue and gross margin amounts would be required 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we continually assess the value of our inventory and will periodically write down its value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and on order  under non cancelable purchase commitments  in comparison to our estimated forecast of product demand for the next nine months 
as demonstrated during  and demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
if actual 
table of contents demand is lower than our forecasted demand we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative effect on our gross margin 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we recorded a full valuation allowance as of december   because  based on the available evidence  we believed at that time it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets in the future 
during the year ended december  we reversed million from the valuation allowance because in management s judgment it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized in the future 
management reached the same conclusion as of december  and as such no valuation allowance has been recorded against our deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
and related interpretations 
we amortize stock based compensation using the straight line method over the vesting periods of the related options  which are generally four years 
we have recorded deferred stock based compensation representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price 
we determined the deemed fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including a valuation report from an independent appraiser  trends in the broad market for technology stocks and the expected valuation we would obtain in an initial public offering 
we recorded as a component of stockholders equity on our balance sheet deferred stock based compensation of million and million relating to certain stock options granted to employees during the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we eliminated  of this deferred stock based compensation as a result of forfeitures of certain of the awards that gave rise to the deferred stock based compensation in and we amortized million  million and million of deferred stock based compensation in the years ended december   and  respectively 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the deemed fair value of our common stock  materially different amounts of stock based compensation could have been reported 
pro forma information regarding net income loss and net income loss per share is required in order to show our net income loss as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
this information is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of options and shares issued pursuant to our option plans at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates experienced by comparable public companies 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of publicly traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock options 

table of contents the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net income loss and net income loss per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share in the future years for the following reasons the number of future shares to be issued under these plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly 
recent accounting pronouncements at its march meeting  the eitf reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the consensus clarifies the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method 
in september  the eitf issued eitf  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which delays the effective date of those paragraphs to be concurrent with the final issuance of eitf a  implementation guidance for the application of paragraph of eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the company anticipates that the adoption of eitf or eitf a will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb  chapter fas 
this statement amends previous guidance as it relates to inventory valuation to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be recorded as current period charges 
the effective date of fas is january  since the guidance in fas reflects our current practices  we do not expect the adoption to have any impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r  an amendment of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
fas r eliminates the ability to account for share based payments using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and instead requires companies to recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the expense will be measured as the fair value of the award at its grant date based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest  and recorded over the applicable service period 
in the absence of an observable market price for a share based award  the fair value would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
the requirements of fas r are effective for our third quarter beginning july  and apply to all awards granted  modified or cancelled after that date as well as unvested awards on that date 
prior to the effective date of fas r  we will continue to provide the pro forma disclosures for past award grants as required under fas the company believes the adoption of fas r will likely result in charges being taken similar to those currently shown in the pro forma disclosure  as required under fas  found in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  and will be effective for the company in its third quarter of fiscal the company does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 

table of contents risk factors affecting future results investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
the risks described below are not exhaustive of the risks that might affect our business 
other risks  including those we currently deem immaterial  may also impact our business 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business operations  results of operations and financial condition and could result in a complete loss of your investment 
we expect our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis  which could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline 
our operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter or year to year for a variety of reasons  many of which are beyond our control 
if our actual revenue were to fall below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts or investors  our quarterly and annual results would be negatively impacted and the price of our stock could decline 
other factors that could affect our quarterly and annual operating results include those listed in this risk factors section of this form k and others such as changes in the pricing policies of or the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  changes in the terms of our contracts with customers or suppliers  slow or negative growth in the networking product  personal computer  internet infrastructure  home electronics and related technology markets  as well as decreased demand for internet access  changes in or consolidation of our sales channels and wholesale distributor relationships or failure to manage our sales channel inventory and warehousing requirements  delay or failure to fulfill orders for our products on a timely basis  our inability to accurately forecast our contract manufacturing needs  delays in the introduction of new or enhanced products by us or market acceptance of these products  an increase in price protection claims  redemptions of marketing rebates  product warranty returns or allowance for doubtful accounts  operational disruptions  such as transportation delays or failure of our order processing system  particularly if they occur at the end of a fiscal quarter  and seasonal patterns of higher sales during the second half of our fiscal year  particularly retail related sales in our fourth quarter 
as a result  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
in addition  our future operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in this event  our stock price could decline significantly 
our future success is dependent on the acceptance of networking products in the small business and home markets into which we sell substantially all of our products 
if the acceptance of networking products in these markets does not continue to grow  we will be unable to increase or sustain our net revenue  and our business will be severely harmed 
we believe that growth in the small business market will depend  in significant part  on the growth of the number of personal computers purchased by these end users and the demand for sharing data intensive applications  such as large graphic files 
we believe that acceptance of networking products in the home will depend upon the availability of affordable broadband internet access and increased demand for wireless products 
unless these markets continue to grow  our business will be unable to expand  which could cause the value of your investment to decline 
moreover  if networking functions are integrated more directly into 
table of contents personal computers and other internet enabled devices  such as electronic gaming platforms or personal video recorders  and these devices do not rely upon external network enabling devices  sales of our products could suffer 
in addition  if the small business or home markets experience a recession or other cyclical effects that diminish or delay networking expenditures  our business growth and profits would be severely limited  and our business could be more severely harmed than those companies that primarily sell to large business customers 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do  and to be competitive we may be required to lower our prices or increase our advertising expenditures or other expenses  which could result in reduced margins and loss of market share 
we compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market  and we expect competition to intensify 
our principal competitors in the small business market include com corporation  allied telesyn international  dell computer corporation  d link systems  inc  hewlett packard company  the linksys division of cisco systems and nortel networks 
our principal competitors in the home market include belkin corporation  d link and the linksys division of cisco systems 
other current and potential competitors include numerous local vendors such as siemens corporation in europe  corega international sa and melco  inc buffalo technology in japan and tp link in china 
our potential competitors also include consumer electronics vendors who could integrate networking capabilities into their line of products 
many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources 
these competitors may  among other things  undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  obtain more favorable pricing from suppliers and manufacturers and exert more influence on the sales channel than we can 
in june  cisco systems acquired the linksys group  a major competitor of ours 
cisco systems has substantial resources that it may direct to developing or purchasing advanced technology  which might be superior to ours 
in addition  it may direct substantial resources to expand its linksys division s distribution channel and to increase its advertising expenditures or otherwise use its resources to successfully compete 
any of these actions could cause us to materially increase our expenses  and could result in our being unable to successfully compete  which would harm our results of operations 
we anticipate that current and potential competitors will also intensify their efforts to penetrate our target markets 
these competitors may have more advanced technology  more extensive distribution channels  stronger brand names  greater access to shelf space in retail locations  bigger promotional budgets and larger customer bases than we do 
these companies could devote more capital resources to develop  manufacture and market competing products than we could 
if any of these companies are successful in competing against us  our sales could decline  our margins could be negatively impacted  and we could lose market share  any of which could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
the average selling prices of our products typically decrease rapidly over the sales cycle of the product  which may negatively affect our gross margins 
our products typically experience price erosion  a fairly rapid reduction in the average selling prices over their respective sales cycles 
in order to sell products that have a falling average selling price and maintain margins at the same time  we need to continually reduce product and manufacturing costs 
to manage manufacturing costs  we must collaborate with our third party manufacturers to engineer the most cost effective design for our products 
in addition  we must carefully manage the price paid for components used in our products 
we must also successfully manage our freight and inventory costs to reduce overall product costs 
we also need to continually introduce new products with higher sales prices and gross margins in order to maintain our overall gross margins 
if we are unable to manage the cost of older products or successfully introduce new products with higher gross margins  our net revenue and overall gross margin would likely decline 

table of contents if we fail to continue to introduce new products and product enhancements that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis  we will not be able to compete effectively and we will be unable to increase or maintain net revenue and gross margins 
we operate in a highly competitive  quickly changing environment  and our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance in the small business and home markets 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify demand trends in the small business and home markets and quickly develop  manufacture and sell products that satisfy these demands in a cost effective manner 
successfully predicting demand trends is difficult  and it is very difficult to predict the effect introducing a new product will have on existing product sales 
we will also need to respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors by quickly introducing competitive products 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products in the past  which resulted in lower quarterly net revenue than expected 
for example  in  we introduced a proprietary wireless networking solution 
later  we decided to re design our products to be compliant with the standard promulgated by the institute of electrical and electronic engineers 
as a result  we introduced our wireless local area networking  or lan  b products in the first quarter of  six months behind some of our competitors 
in addition  we have experienced unanticipated delays in product introductions beyond announced release dates 
any future delays in product development and introduction could result in loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share  negative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand  decline in the average selling price of our products  and adverse reactions in our sales channel  such as reduced shelf space or reduced online product visibility 
we depend substantially on our sales channel  and our failure to maintain and expand our sales channel would result in lower sales and reduced net revenue 
to maintain and grow our market share  net revenue and brand  we must maintain and expand our sales channel 
we sell our products through our sales channel  which consists of traditional retailers  on line retailers  direct market resellers  or dmrs  value added resellers  or vars  and broadband service providers 
these entities typically purchase our products through our wholesale distributors 
we sell to small businesses primarily through dmrs  vars and retail locations  and we sell to our home users primarily through retail locations  online retailers and broadband service providers 
we generally have no minimum purchase commitments or long term contracts with any of these third parties 
traditional retailers have limited shelf space and promotional budgets  and competition is intense for these resources 
a competitor with more extensive product lines and stronger brand identity  such as cisco systems  may have greater bargaining power with these retailers 
the competition for retail shelf space may increase  which would require us to increase our marketing expenditures simply to maintain current levels of retail shelf space 
the recent trend in the consolidation of online retailers and dmr channels has resulted in intensified competition for preferred product placement  such as product placement on an online retailer s home page 
expanding our presence in the var channel may be difficult and expensive 
we compete with established companies that have longer operating histories and longstanding relationships with vars that we would find highly desirable as sales channel partners 
if we were unable to maintain and expand our sales channel  our growth would be limited and our business would be harmed 
we must also continuously monitor and evaluate emerging sales channels 
if we fail to establish a presence in an important developing sales channel  our business could be harmed 
if disruptions in our transportation network occur or our shipping costs substantially increase  we may be unable to sell our products and our operating expenses could increase 
we are highly dependent upon the transportation systems we use to ship our products  including surface and air freight 
our attempts to closely match our inventory levels to our product demand intensify the need 
table of contents for our transportation systems to function effectively and without delay 
the transportation network is subject to disruption or congestion from a variety of causes  including labor disputes or port strikes  acts of war or terrorism  natural disasters and congestion resulting from higher shipping volumes 
for example  in the second half of  ports on the west coast have experienced and continue to experience higher than usual shipping traffic  resulting in congestion and delays in our product shipment schedules 
labor disputes among freight carriers are common  especially in emea  and we expect labor unrest and its effects on shipping our products to be a continuing challenge for us 
since september   the rate of inspection of international freight by governmental entities has substantially increased  and has become increasingly unpredictable 
if our delivery times increase unexpectedly for these or any other reasons  our ability to deliver products on time would be materially adversely affected and result in delayed or lost revenue 
in addition  if the recent increases in fuel prices were to continue  our transportation costs would likely further increase 
moreover  the cost of shipping our products by air freight is greater than other methods 
from time to time in the past  we have shipped products using air freight to meet unexpected spikes in demand or to bring new product introductions to market quickly 
if we rely more heavily upon air freight to deliver our products  our overall shipping costs will increase 
a prolonged transportation disruption or a significant increase in the cost of freight could severely disrupt our business and harm our operating results 
if we do not effectively manage our sales channel inventory and product mix  we may incur costs associated with excess inventory  or lose sales from having too few products 
if we are unable to properly monitor  control and manage our sales channel inventory and maintain an appropriate level and mix of products with our wholesale distributors and within our sales channel  we may incur increased and unexpected costs associated with this inventory 
we generally allow wholesale distributors and traditional retailers to return a limited amount of our products in exchange for other products 
under our price protection policy  if we reduce the list price of a product  we are often required to issue a credit in an amount equal to the reduction for each of the products held in inventory by our wholesale distributors and retailers 
if our wholesale distributors and retailers are unable to sell their inventory in a timely manner  we might lower the price of the products  or these parties may exchange the products for newer products 
also  during the transition from an existing product to a new replacement product  we must accurately predict the demand for the existing and the new products 
if we improperly forecast demand for our products we could end up with too many products and be unable to sell the excess inventory in a timely manner  if at all  or  alternatively we could end up with too few products and not be able to satisfy demand 
this problem is exacerbated because we attempt to closely match inventory levels with product demand leaving limited margin for error 
if these events occur  we could incur increased expenses associated with writing off excessive or obsolete inventory or lose sales and therefore suffer declining gross margins 
we could become subject to litigation  including litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could be costly and subject us to significant liability 
the networking industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding infringement of patents  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  leading companies in the data communications markets  some of which are competitors  have extensive patent portfolios with respect to networking technology 
from time to time  third parties  including these leading companies  have asserted and may continue to assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights against us demanding license or royalty payments or seeking payment for damages  injunctive relief and other available legal remedies through litigation 
these include third parties who claim to own patents or other intellectual property that cover industry standards that our products comply with 
if we are unable to resolve these matters or obtain licenses on acceptable or commercially reasonable terms  we could be sued 
the cost of any necessary licenses could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
also  at any time  any of these companies  or any other third party could initiate litigation against us  which could divert management attention  be costly to defend  prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology  require us to design around the challenged 
table of contents technology and cause the price of our stock to decline 
in addition  third parties  some of whom are potential competitors  may initiate litigation against our manufacturers  suppliers or members of our sales channel  alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to existing or future products 
in the event successful claims of infringement are brought by third parties  and if we are unable to obtain licenses or to independently develop alternative technology on a timely basis  we may be subject to an indemnification obligation or unable to offer competitive products  and be subject to increased expenses 
finally  consumer class action lawsuits related to the marketing and performance of our home networking products have been asserted and may in the future be asserted against us 
if we do not resolve these claims on a favorable basis  our business  operating results and financial condition could be significantly harmed 
we rely on a limited number of wholesale distributors and direct customers for most of our sales  and if they refuse to pay our requested prices or reduce their level of purchases  our net revenue could decline 
we sell a substantial portion of our products through wholesale distributors  including ingram micro  inc and tech data corporation 
during the fiscal year ended  sales to ingram micro and its affiliates accounted for of our net revenue and sales to tech data and its affiliates accounted for of our net revenue 
we expect that a significant portion of our net revenue will continue to come from sales to a small number of wholesale distributors for the foreseeable future 
in addition  because our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small group of purchasers  the failure of any of them to pay on a timely basis  or at all  would reduce our cash flow 
we generally have no minimum purchase commitments or long term contracts with any of these distributors 
these purchasers could decide at any time to discontinue  decrease or delay their purchases of our products 
in addition  the prices that they pay for our products are subject to negotiation and could change at any time 
if any of our major wholesale distributors reduce their level of purchases or refuse to pay the prices that we set for our products  our net revenue and operating results could be harmed 
if our wholesale distributors increase the size of their product orders without sufficient lead time for us to process the order  our ability to fulfill product demands would be compromised 
if we fail to successfully grow our broadband service provider sales channel  our net revenues will be negatively impacted 
we face a number of challenges associated with penetrating the broadband service provider market that differ from what we have traditionally faced with the retail market 
these challenges include a longer sales cycle  more stringent product testing and validation requirements  a higher level of customer service and support demands  competition from established suppliers and our general inexperience in selling to carriers 
if we do not successfully overcome these challenges  we will not be able to grow our carrier sales channel and our growth will be slowed 
if our products contain defects or errors  we could incur significant unexpected expenses  experience product returns and lost sales  experience product recalls  suffer damage to our brand and reputation  and be subject to product liability or other claims 
our products are complex and may contain defects  errors or failures  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
some errors and defects may be discovered only after a product has been installed and used by the end user 
if our products contain defects or errors  we could experience decreased sales and increased product returns  loss of customers and market share  and increased service  warranty and insurance costs 
in addition  our reputation and brand could be damaged  and we could face legal claims regarding our products 
a successful product liability or other claim could result in negative publicity and further harm our reputation  result in unexpected expenses and adversely impact our operating results 
if the redemption rate for our end user promotional programs is higher than we estimate  then our net revenues and gross margins will be negatively affected 
from time to time we offer promotional incentives  including cash rebates  to encourage end users to purchase certain of our products 
purchasers must follow specific and stringent guidelines to redeem these incentives or rebates 
often qualified purchasers choose not to apply for the incentives or fail to follow the 
table of contents required redemption guidelines  resulting in an incentive redemption rate of less than 
based on historical data  we estimate an incentive redemption rate for our promotional programs 
if the actual redemption rate is higher than our estimated rate  our net revenues and gross margins will be negatively affected 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and related regulations are resulting in increased costs to us 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and recent rules enacted and proposed by the sec and the nasdaq national market  are resulting in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements 
in particular  complying with the internal control audit requirements of sarbanes oxley section is resulting in increased internal efforts and higher fees from our independent accounting firm and compliance consultant 
the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage and or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  on committees of our board of directors  or as executive officers 
we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs that we may incur as we implement these new and proposed rules 
we are required to evaluate our internal control under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and any adverse results from such evaluation could impact the reliability of our internal controls over financial reporting 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  beginning with our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december   we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
such report will contain among other matters  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
such report must also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of such internal controls 
public company oversight board auditing standard no 
provides the professional standards and related performance guidance for auditors to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting under section we will continue to perform the system and process documentation and evaluation needed to comply with section  which is both costly and challenging 
during this process  if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of a fiscal year  or if our auditors are unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we depend on a limited number of third party contract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing needs 
if these contract manufacturers experience any delay  disruption or quality control problems in their operations  we could lose market share and our brand may suffer 
all of our products are manufactured  assembled  tested and generally packaged by a limited number of original design manufacturers  or odms  and original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by asustek computer  inc  cameo communications corporation  delta networks  inc  hon hai precision industry co  ltd  sercomm corporation and z com  inc we rely on our contract manufacturers to procure components and  in some cases  subcontract engineering work 
some of 
table of contents our products are manufactured by a single contract manufacturer 
we do not have any long term contracts with any of our third party contract manufacturers 
some of these third party contract manufacturers produce products for our competitors 
the loss of the services of any of our primary third party contract manufacturers could cause a significant disruption in operations and delays in product shipments 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming 
our reliance on third party contract manufacturers also exposes us to the following risks over which we have limited control unexpected increases in manufacturing and repair costs  inability to control the quality of finished products  inability to control delivery schedules  and potential lack of adequate capacity to manufacture all or a part of the products we require 
all of our products must satisfy safety and regulatory standards and some of our products must also receive government certifications 
our odm and oem contract manufacturers are primarily responsible for obtaining most regulatory approvals for our products 
if our odms and oems fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we would be unable to sell our products and our sales and profitability could be reduced  our relationships with our sales channel could be harmed  and our reputation and brand would suffer 
if we are unable to provide our third party contract manufacturers an accurate forecast of our component and material requirements  we may experience delays in the manufacturing of our products and the costs of our products may increase 
we provide our third party contract manufacturers with a rolling forecast of demand  which they use to determine our material and component requirements 
lead times for ordering materials and components vary significantly and depend on various factors  such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand and supply for a component at a given time 
some of our components have long lead times  such as wireless local area network chipsets  switching fabric chips  physical layer transceivers  connector jacks and metal and plastic enclosures 
if our forecasts are less than our actual requirements  our contract manufacturers may be unable to manufacture products in a timely manner 
if our forecasts are too high  our contract manufacturers will be unable to use the components they have purchased on our behalf 
the cost of the components used in our products tends to drop rapidly as volumes increase and the technologies mature 
therefore  if our contract manufacturers are unable to promptly use components purchased on our behalf  our cost of producing products may be higher than our competitors due to an over supply of higher priced components 
moreover  if they are unable to use components ordered at our direction  we will need to reimburse them for any losses they incur 
we obtain several key components from limited or sole sources  and if these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements  we may lose sales and experience increased component costs 
any shortage or delay in the supply of key product components would harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries 
many of the semiconductors used in our products are specifically designed for use in our products and are obtained from sole source suppliers on a purchase order basis 
in addition  some components that are used in all our products are obtained from limited sources 
these components include connector jacks  plastic casings and physical layer transceivers 
we also obtain switching fabric semiconductors  which are used in our ethernet switches and internet gateway products  and wireless local area network chipsets  which are used in all of our wireless products  from a limited number of suppliers 
our contract manufacturers purchase these components on our behalf on a purchase order basis  and we do not have any contractual commitments or guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
if demand for a specific component increases  we may not be able to obtain an adequate number of that component in a timely manner 
in addition  if our suppliers experience financial or other difficulties or if worldwide demand for the components they provide increases significantly  the availability of these components could be limited 
it could be difficult  costly and time 
table of contents consuming to obtain alternative sources for these components  or to change product designs to make use of alternative components 
in addition  difficulties in transitioning from an existing supplier to a new supplier could create delays in component availability that would have a significant impact on our ability to fulfill orders for our products 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components  or if we experience any interruption in the supply of components  our product shipments could be reduced or delayed 
this would affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries  damage our brand and reputation in the market  and cause us to lose market share 
we rely upon third parties for technology that is critical to our products  and if we are unable to continue to use this technology and future technology  our ability to sell technologically advanced products would be limited 
we rely on third parties to obtain non exclusive patented hardware and software license rights in technologies that are incorporated into and necessary for the operation and functionality of our products 
because the intellectual property we license is available from third parties  barriers to entry may be lower than if we owned exclusive rights to the technology we license and use 
on the other hand  if a competitor or potential competitor enters into an exclusive arrangement with any of our key third party technology providers  our ability to develop and sell products containing that technology would be severely limited 
our licenses often require royalty payments or other consideration to third parties 
our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to these technologies  and we do not know whether these third party technologies will continue to be licensed to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to license the necessary technology  we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards 
this would limit and delay our ability to offer competitive products and increase our costs of production 
as a result  our margins  market share  and operating results could be significantly harmed 
if we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property rights  our ability to compete could be harmed 
we rely upon third parties for a substantial portion of the intellectual property we use in our products 
at the same time  we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws  nondisclosure agreements with employees  consultants and suppliers and other contractual provisions to establish  maintain and protect our intellectual property rights 
despite efforts to protect our intellectual property  unauthorized third parties may attempt to design around  copy aspects of our product design or obtain and use technology or other intellectual property associated with our products 
for example  one of our primary intellectual property assets is the netgear name  trademark and logo 
we may be unable to stop third parties from adopting similar names  trademarks and logos  especially in those international markets where our intellectual property rights may be less protected 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technology or design around our intellectual property 
our inability to secure and protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our brand and business  operating results and financial condition 
our sales and operations in international markets expose us to operational  financial and regulatory risks 
international sales comprise a significant amount of our overall net revenue 
international sales were of overall net revenue in fiscal we anticipate that international sales may grow as a percentage of net revenue 
we have committed resources to expanding our international operations and sales channels and these efforts may not be successful 
international operations are subject to a number of other risks  including political and economic instability  international terrorism and anti american sentiment  particularly in emerging markets  preference for locally branded products  and laws and business practices favoring local competition  exchange rate fluctuations  
table of contents increased difficulty in managing inventory  delayed revenue recognition  less effective protection of intellectual property  and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations 
we currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions 
although the majority of our international sales are currently invoiced in united states dollars  we have implemented and continue to implement for certain countries both invoicing and payment in local foreign currencies  and therefore our exposure to losses in foreign currency transactions will increase 
moreover  the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations 
for example  if the united states dollar declined in value relative to a local currency  we could be required to pay more for our expenditures in that market  including salaries  commissions  local operations and marketing expenses  each of which is paid in local currency 
in addition  we may lose customers if exchange rate fluctuations  currency devaluations or economic crises increase the local currency price of our products or reduce our customers ability to purchase products 
we intend to expand our operations and infrastructure  which may strain our operations and increase our operating expenses 
we intend to expand our operations and pursue market opportunities domestically and internationally to grow our sales 
we expect that this attempted expansion will strain our existing management information systems  and operational and financial controls 
in addition  if we continue to grow  our expenditures will likely be significantly higher than our historical costs 
we may not be able to install adequate controls in an efficient and timely manner as our business grows  and our current systems may not be adequate to support our future operations 
the difficulties associated with installing and implementing these new systems  procedures and controls may place a significant burden on our management  operational and financial resources 
in addition  if we grow internationally  we will have to expand and enhance our communications infrastructure 
if we fail to continue to improve our management information systems  procedures and financial controls or encounter unexpected difficulties during expansion  our business could be harmed 
we intend to implement an international reorganization  which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 
we plan to reorganize our foreign subsidiaries and entities to manage and optimize our international operations 
our implementation of this project will require substantial efforts by our staff and could result in increased staffing requirements and related expenses 
failure to successfully execute the reorganization or other factors outside of our control could negatively impact the timing and extent of any benefit we receive from the reorganization 
the restructuring will also require us to amend a number of our customer and supplier agreements  which will require the consent of our third party customers and suppliers 
in addition  there could be unanticipated interruptions in our business operations as a result of implementing these changes that could result in loss or delay in revenue causing an adverse effect on our financial results 
our stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
with the current uncertainty about economic conditions in the united states  there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of technology and other companies  which may be unrelated to the financial performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
some specific factors that may have a significant effect on our common stock market price include actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors operating results  actual or anticipated changes in our growth rates or our competitors growth rates  conditions in the financial markets in general or changes in general economic conditions  
table of contents our ability to raise additional capital  and changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  other comparable companies or our industry generally 
natural disasters  mischievous actions or terrorist attacks could delay our ability to receive or ship our products  or otherwise disrupt our business 
our corporate headquarters are located in northern california and one of our warehouses is located in southern california  regions known for seismic activity 
in addition  substantially all of our manufacturing occurs in two geographically concentrated areas in mainland china  where disruptions from natural disasters  health epidemics and political  social and economic instability may affect the region 
if our manufacturers or warehousing facilities are disrupted or destroyed  we would be unable to distribute our products on a timely basis  which could harm our business 
moreover  if our computer information systems or communication systems  or those of our vendors or customers  are subject to disruptive hacker attacks or other disruptions  our business could suffer 
we have not established a formal disaster recovery plan 
our back up operations may be inadequate and our business interruption insurance may not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur 
a significant business interruption could result in losses or damages and harm our business 
for example  much of our order fulfillment process is automated and the order information is stored on our servers 
if our computer systems and servers go down even for a short period at the end of a fiscal quarter  our ability to recognize revenue would be delayed until we were again able to process and ship our orders  which could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
if we lose the services of our chairman and chief executive officer  patrick cs lo  or our other key personnel  we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 
our future success depends in large part upon the continued services of our key technical  sales  marketing and senior management personnel 
in particular  the services of patrick cs lo  our chairman and chief executive officer  who has led our company since its inception  are very important to our business 
all of our executive officers or key employees are at will employees  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key research  development  sales or marketing personnel  particularly if lost to competitors  could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing needs of the small business and home markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
we generally have not hedged currency exposures 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce sales and or result in operating losses 
certain operating expenses of our foreign operations require payment in the local currencies 
as of december   the company had net payables in various local currencies 
however  based on the total amount of these payables due in foreign currencies as of december   a movement of in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our operating results
