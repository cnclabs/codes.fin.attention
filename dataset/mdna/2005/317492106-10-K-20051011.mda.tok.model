item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview financial federal corporation is an independent financial services company operating through three wholly owned subsidiaries 
we do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries  partnerships or joint ventures 
we also do not have any off balance sheet assets or liabilities other than commitments to extend credit  goodwill  other intangible assets or pension obligations  and we are not involved in income tax shelters 
we have one fully consolidated special purpose entity we established for our on balance sheet asset securitization facility 
we have one line of business  lending money in the form of installment sale agreements  secured loans and leases collectively referred to as finance receivables to small and medium sized businesses for their equipment financing needs 
we generate revenue solely from interest and other fees earned on our finance receivables 
we need to borrow most of the money we lend  therefore liquidity is important 
we borrow from banks and insurance companies and issue commercial paper to money market funds and other investors 
at july   approximately of our finance receivables were funded with debt 
we earn interest income on our finance receivables and incur interest expense on our debt 
we focus on i maximizing the difference between the rates we earn on our receivables and the rates we incur on our debt net interest spread ii maintaining the credit quality of our receivables and iii managing our interest rate risk 
interest rates on our finance receivables are fixed and floating  and interest rates on our debt are fixed and floating adjusted to reflect the million of fixed rate term notes issued on august  
therefore  changes in market interest rates affect our profitability significantly 
the credit quality of our finance receivables can also affect our profitability significantly 
credit quality can affect revenue  provisions for credit losses and operating expenses through reclassifying receivables to or from non accrual status  incurring charge offs and incurring costs associated with non performing assets 
we use various strategies to manage our interest rate risk and credit risk 
our main areas of focus are asset quality  liquidity and interest rate risk 
we discuss each in detail in separate sections of this discussion 
these areas are integral to our long term profitability 
our key performance measures are net charge offs and loss ratio  non performing assets  delinquencies  receivables growth  leverage  available liquidity  net interest margin and net interest spread  and expense and efficiency ratios 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies involving significant judgment  assumptions and estimates are considered critical accounting policies and are described below 
the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is our estimate of losses inherent in our finance receivables at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is difficult to determine and requires a significant degree of judgment 
the allowance is based on total finance receivables  charge off experience  non accrual and delinquent finance receivables and our current assessment of the risks inherent in our finance receivables from national and regional economic conditions  industry conditions  concentrations  the financial condition of counterparties includes the customer  equipment vendors  manufacturers and the customer s owners or affiliates  collateral values and other factors 
we may need to change the allowance level significantly if unexpected changes in these factors occur 
increases in the allowance would reduce net income through higher provisions for credit losses 
the allowance was million of finance receivables at july  including million specifically allocated to impaired receivables 
the allowance includes amounts specifically allocated to impaired receivables and a general amount providing for losses inherent in the remainder of finance receivables 
in evaluating the net realizable value of impaired receivables  we may record a write down or establish a specific allowance based on the probability of loss 
we record write downs based on the fair value of the collateral 
we establish specific allowances when collecting all amounts due is not fully supported solely by the value of the primary collateral depending on the level and type of other items supporting collectibility 
the general allowance is determined by a quarterly analysis of historical losses charge offs for the prior two years comparable with the average life of our receivables used to develop percentage loss ranges to apply to receivables based on their assigned risk profile 
risk profiles are assigned to receivables based on industry and past due status 
we adjust the calculated range of losses for expected recoveries and we may also adjust the range for differences between current and historical loss trends and other factors 
at july   we adjusted the range higher to account for the potential effects that significantly higher oil prices could have on our customers cash flows and ability to remit payments to us and on the economy 
although our method is designed to calculate probable losses  because significant estimates are used  the calculated range of losses  as adjusted  may differ significantly from actual losses 
we record impaired finance receivables at their current estimated net realizable value if less than their carrying amount 
we record assets received to satisfy receivables at their current estimated fair value less selling costs if less than their carrying amount 
we estimate these values based on our evaluation of the expected cash flows and market value and condition of the collateral or assets 
we evaluate market value by analyzing recent sales of similar equipment and used equipment publications  using our market knowledge and making inquiries of equipment vendors 
unexpected adverse changes in or incorrect conclusions on expected cash flows  market value or condition of collateral or assets  or time needed to sell equipment would require us to record a write down 
this would lower net income 
impaired finance receivables and assets received to satisfy receivables totaled million of finance receivables at july  we record residual values on direct financing leases at the lowest of i any stated purchase option ii the present value at the end of the initial lease term of rentals due under any renewal options or iii our projection of the equipment s fair value at the end of the lease 
we may not fully realize recorded residual values because of unexpected adverse changes in equipment values 
this would lower net income 
residual values were million of finance receivables at july  historically  we have realized the recorded residual value on disposition 
significant events in may  our major operating subsidiary issued million of five year  fixed rate term notes 
we received million in may and million in august interest on the notes is payable semi annually 
the notes are due at maturity in may and august prepayment of the notes is subject to a premium based on a yield maintenance formula 
the note agreement has substantially the same restrictive covenants in the subsidiary s existing note agreements including limits on the subsidiary s indebtedness  encumbrances  investments  dividends and other distributions to us  sales of assets  mergers and other business combinations  capital expenditures  interest coverage and net worth 
the note agreement does not have a material adverse change clause 
this debt refinanced million of floating rate term notes  million of term notes that matured in june and million of term notes that matured in july and august the floating rate term notes were prepaid at principal  without penalty 
their remaining terms ranged from four months to five years weighted average slightly over two years  and their weighted average rate  based on current market interest rates  would have been 
these refinancings lowered our weighted average cost of funds  reduced our exposure to rising short term market interest rates the fixed rate portion of our debt increased to from and the floating rate portion decreased to from  extended debt maturities and increased liquidity 
results of operations comparison of fiscal to fiscal years ended july  in millions  except per share amounts change change finance income interest expense net finance income before provision for credit losses provision for credit losses salaries and other expenses provision for income taxes net income diluted earnings per share basic earnings per share net income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the effects of significantly fewer non performing assets and  to a lesser extent  receivables growth  partially offset by the effects of significantly higher short term market interest rates  continued low long term market interest rates  and  to a lesser extent  increased costs associated with being a public company includes external and internal audit fees  sarbanes oxley compliance costs  legal fees  insurance and board of directors fees 
finance income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in average finance receivables million to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  lower non accrual receivables 
partially offsetting these positive factors was the lower net yield of finance receivables 
continued low long term market interest rates  partially offset by increases in yields on floating rate receivables from increases in the prime rate  reduced the net yield on finance receivables to in fiscal from in fiscal interest expense incurred on borrowings used to fund finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from higher average short term market interest rates and the million increase in average debt 
increases in short term market interest rates  partially offset by the lower average rate on our fixed rate term debt and better credit spreads  raised our weighted average cost of funds to in fiscal from in fiscal interest expense for fiscal included two nonrecurring items  a million gain recognized on interest rate locks see the market interest rates and sensitivity section for further discussion and a million expense representing unamortized deferred debt issuance costs on debt prepaid during the year 
net finance income before provision for credit losses on finance receivables decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net interest margin net finance income before provision for credit losses expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables outstanding decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net interest margin decreased because our weighted average cost of funds was higher  the net yield on our finance receivables was lower and our leverage increased slightly 
the provision for credit losses on finance receivables decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease resulted from significantly lower net charge offs and improved asset quality  partially offset by receivables growth 
the provision for credit losses is the amount needed to change the allowance for credit losses to the appropriate estimated level 
net charge offs write downs of finance receivables less recoveries decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the loss ratio net charge offs expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net charge offs decreased because of higher recoveries  fewer non accrual receivables and improved equipment values 
salaries and other expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease resulted from cost savings generated by significantly fewer non performing assets  partially offset by higher costs associated with being a public company 
salary expense did not change significantly 
the expense ratio salaries and other expenses expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables outstanding decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal because of the decrease in expenses and increase in receivables 
the efficiency ratio expense ratio expressed as a percentage of net interest margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal because of the decrease in expenses 
the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal resulting from the increase in income before income taxes  partially offset by the slight decrease in our effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal diluted earnings per share increased by to in fiscal from in fiscal  and basic earnings per share increased by to in fiscal from in fiscal the percentage increases in diluted and basic earnings per share exceeded the percentage increase in net income because we repurchased million shares of common stock in april comparison of fiscal to fiscal years ended july  in millions  except per share amounts change change finance income interest expense net finance income before provision for credit losses provision for credit losses salaries and other expenses loss on redemption of debt provision for income taxes net income diluted earnings per share basic earnings per share net income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal excluding a nonrecurring million convertible debt redemption loss in fiscal million after tax  net income was the same in fiscal and the positive effects of fewer non performing assets  the decrease in average debt exceeding the decrease in average finance receivables and  to a lesser extent  lower salary expense were offset by the effects of continued low market interest rates and  to a lesser extent  increased costs associated with being a public company 
finance income decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease resulted from the lower net yield of finance receivables 
continued low market interest rates reduced the average net yield on finance receivables to in fiscal from in fiscal average finance receivables decreased by less than million to billion from billion 
interest expense decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease resulted from the lower weighted average cost of funds and  to a lesser extent  the million decrease in average debt 
lower market interest rates  million of fixed rate term notes swapped to significantly lower floating rates and  to a lesser extent  the maturity of high fixed rate term notes reduced the weighted average cost of funds to in fiscal from in fiscal net finance income before provision for credit losses on finance receivables decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net interest margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease resulted from the effects of continued low market interest rates 
the provision for credit losses on finance receivables decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal because of the decrease in net charge offs 
net charge offs decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the loss ratio decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net charge offs decreased because of fewer non accrual receivables and improved equipment resale values 
salaries and other expenses increased by less than to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from higher costs associated with being a public company offset by cost savings from the decrease in non performing assets and  to a lesser extent  decreased salary expense due to the effect of workforce reductions exceeding salary increases 
the expense ratio was in fiscal and in fiscal  and the efficiency ratio was in fiscal and in fiscal the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal resulting from the increase in income before income taxes partially offset by the slight decrease in our effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal diluted earnings per share increased by to in fiscal from in fiscal  and basic earnings per share increased by to in fiscal from in fiscal diluted and basic earnings per share for fiscal excluding the after tax loss on redemption of convertible debt were and  respectively 
the amounts of net income and diluted and basic earnings per share excluding the fiscal million after tax convertible debt redemption loss are non gaap financial measures 
we believe these amounts are useful to investors in comparing our fiscal and fiscal operating results 
this nonrecurring loss resulted from our redemption of convertible subordinated notes 
we redeemed the notes to eliminate their dilutive effect 
finance receivables and asset quality we discuss trends and characteristics of our finance receivables and our approach to managing credit risk in this section 
the key aspect is asset quality 
asset quality statistics measure our underwriting standards  skills and policies and procedures and can indicate the direction and levels of future charge offs and non performing assets 
july  july  in millions change change finance receivables   allowance for credit losses net charge offs non performing assets delinquent finance receivables as a percentage of receivables allowance for credit losses net charge offs non performing assets delinquent finance receivables as of and for the year ended finance receivables comprise installment sale agreements and secured loans collectively referred to as loans and direct financing leases 
finance receivables outstanding increased by million to billion at july  from billion at july  at july   loans were billion of finance receivables and leases were million 
finance receivables originated in fiscal and were billion and million  respectively 
originations increased because of greater demand for domestic equipment financing and increases in marketing personnel 
finance receivables collected in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
collections increased because of higher average finance receivables and increased pre payments 
our primary focus is the credit quality of our receivables 
we manage our credit risk by using disciplined and proven underwriting policies and procedures  by monitoring our receivables closely and by effectively handling non performing accounts 
our underwriting policies and procedures require a first lien on equipment financed 
we focus on financing equipment with an economic life longer than the term financed  historically low levels of technological obsolescence  use in more than one type of business  ease of access and transporting  and broad  established resale markets 
securing our receivables with this equipment can mitigate potential charge offs 
we may also obtain additional equipment or other collateral  third party guarantees  advanced payments or hold back a portion of the amount financed 
we do not finance or lease aircraft or railcars  computer related equipment  telecommunications equipment or equipment located outside the united states  and we do not lend to consumers 
our underwriting policies limit our credit exposure with any single customer 
at july   this limit was million 
our ten largest customers accounted for million of total finance receivables at july  the allowance for credit losses was million at july  and million at july  the allowance level declined to of finance receivables at july  from at july  because of the decrease in credit losses and improvement in asset quality 
we periodically review the allowance to determine that its level is appropriate 
the allowance level may decline further if our asset quality statistics remain favorable 
net charge offs of finance receivables write downs less recoveries decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and the loss ratio decreased to from 
net charge offs have been decreasing because of higher recoveries of prior write offs  fewer non performing assets and improved economic conditions and equipment values 
non performing assets comprise non accrual finance receivables and repossessed equipment assets received to satisfy receivables as follows in millions july  non accrual finance receivables repossessed equipment total non performing assets before specifically allocated allowance of million at july  and million at july  the net investment in delinquent finance receivables transactions with more than a nominal portion of a contractual payment or more days past due was million of total receivables at july  compared to million of total receivables at july  our asset quality statistics improved during fiscal because of better economic conditions and were at favorable levels at july  net charge offs  repossessed equipment and delinquencies were far below expected levels 
therefore  we do not expect further improvement in these measures and reasonable increases would not necessarily indicate the start of a negative trend 
non accrual finance receivables may decline further decreases in non accrual receivables typically trail decreases in delinquencies because several months of payment performance must occur to reclassify a receivable to accrual status 
at july   approximately of non accrual finance receivables were not delinquent 
although we expect our asset quality statistics to stay at favorable levels  the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita  and significantly higher oil prices and market interest rates could adversely affect these statistics 
gasoline and interest are significant costs for most of our customers and the increases in these costs could significantly impact their operating cash flows and their ability to remit payments 
increases in these costs can also adversely affect the economy 
in addition  several customers owe us over million 
if any of these receivables became delinquent  impaired or repossessed  our asset quality statistics could worsen even though the overall trend may remain positive 
we have approximately million of finance receivables from customers in the areas most affected by hurricanes katrina and rita 
we are still determining their ability to remit payments  their business prospects and the condition of our collateral 
this may take several months to complete 
we also do not know the extent of any aid these customers may receive from the us government or the extent of insurance coverage 
we do not expect significant increases in write downs or non accrual receivables based on our preliminary discussions with customers representing most of the million of receivables 
the nature and extent of the cleanup and reconstruction of the areas destroyed by the hurricanes could lead to increased demand for most of the equipment we finance 
our finance receivables reflect industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk 
these concentrations result from customers having similar economic characteristics that could cause their ability to meet their contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
at july   our industry concentrations were construction related  road transportation and waste services and our us regional geographic concentrations were southeast  southwest  northeast  west and central 
liquidity and capital resources we describe our needs for substantial amounts of capital debt and equity  our approach to managing liquidity and our current funding sources in this section 
key indicators are leverage  available liquidity and credit ratings 
our credit ratings were affirmed in august  our leverage is low for a financial company  we have ample liquidity available and the maturities of our debt are staggered and exceed the maturities of our finance receivables 
liquidity and access to capital are vital to our operations and growth 
we need continued availability of funds to originate or acquire finance receivables  to purchase portfolios of finance receivables and to repay debt 
to ensure we have enough liquidity  we project our financing needs based on estimated receivables growth and maturing debt  we closely monitor capital markets and we diversify our funding sources 
funding sources available to us include operating cash flow  private and public issuances of term debt  conduit and term securitizations of finance receivables  committed unsecured revolving credit facilities  dealer placed and direct issued commercial paper and sales of common and preferred equity 
we believe that our liquidity sources are diversified and we are not dependent on any funding source or any credit provider 
at july   we had million available under our bank credit facilities net of commercial paper outstanding 
adding the august million increase in our asset securitization facility  issuance of million of term notes and million of new bank credit facilities  increases this amount to million 
our asset securitization facility can be increased further by million and we can issue more term debt 
we believe  but cannot assure  sufficient liquidity is available to support our future operations and growth 
our term debt is rated bbb by fitch ratings  inc fitch  a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization and commercial paper issued by our major operating subsidiary million at july  is rated f by fitch 
in august  fitch affirmed its investment grade ratings on our debt and maintained its stable outlook 
our access to capital markets and our credit spreads are partly dependent on these investment grade credit ratings 
in july  fitch raised its rating on our senior term debt to bbb from bbb 
our major operating subsidiary s debt agreements have restrictive covenants including limits on indebtedness  encumbrances  investments  dividends and other distributions to us  sales of assets  mergers and other business combinations  capital expenditures  interest coverage and net worth 
none of the agreements have a material adverse change clause 
total debt increased by million to billion at july  from billion at july  and stockholders equity increased by million to million at july  from million at july  leverage debt to equity ratio increased to at july  from at july   but remains low  allowing for substantial asset growth 
historically  our leverage has not exceeded debt comprised the following in millions july  july  amount percent amount percent term notes asset securitization financings convertible debentures borrowings under bank credit facilities commercial paper total principal   fair value adjustment of hedged debt total debt   term notes in january  we repaid million of fixed rate term notes at maturity with proceeds from borrowings under bank credit facilities 
at july   the million of term notes comprised million of private placements and medium term notes issued to insurance companies and million of bank term loans 
asset securitization financings our asset securitization facility was increased by million to million in august we used the proceeds to repay borrowings under bank credit facilities 
we established the facility in july the facility was renewed for the fourth time in april and expires in april subject to further renewal 
in january  we borrowed the million available under the facility and repaid bank borrowings 
the facility limits borrowings to a minimum level of securitized receivables 
if borrowings exceed the minimum level  we must repay the excess or securitize more receivables 
we can securitize more receivables during the term of the facility 
on expiration and nonrenewal of the facility  we must repay borrowings outstanding or convert them into term debt 
the term debt would be repaid monthly based on the amount of securitized receivables 
based on the contractual payments of the million of securitized receivables at july   the term debt would be fully repaid by january the unsecured debt agreements of our major operating subsidiary allow of its finance receivables to be securitized million at july  
therefore  we can securitize an additional million of finance receivables at july  the facility limits borrowings to of securitized receivables 
convertible debentures the convertible debentures were convertible into million shares as adjusted of common stock at the adjusted conversion price of per share resulting in an adjusted conversion rate of shares for each  of principal 
in december  we irrevocably elected to pay the value of converted debentures  not exceeding the principal amount  in cash 
we will pay any value over principal with shares of common stock 
this eliminated the million shares of common stock issuable upon conversion 
the debentures can be converted only under the following circumstances  i in any fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common stock was at least higher than the current conversion price for at least of the last trading days of the prior fiscal quarter the market price condition ii the debentures are rated bb or lower by fitch three ratings levels lower than the initial rating iii we call the debentures for redemption or iv a specified corporate transaction occurs 
currently  the market price condition would be met if the price of our common stock closed above for the required period 
our common stock closed at on july  we can redeem the debentures for their principal amount anytime starting in april and debenture holders can require us to repurchase debentures for principal on each five year anniversary of issuance or when a specified corporate transaction occurs 
the debentures have a year term 
at july   no event occurred that would have allowed the debentures to be converted 
bank credit facilities we had million of committed unsecured revolving credit facilities from nine banks a million increase from july  at july  this includes million of facilities with original terms ranging from two to five years and million of facilities with an original term of one year 
these facilities range from million to million 
at july   million was outstanding  maturing in one to nineteen days 
the multiyear facilities expire as follows in millions fiscal these facilities are a dependable  low cost source of funds and support our commercial paper program 
we can borrow the full amount under each facility 
none of the facilities are for commercial paper back up only 
these facilities may be renewed upon expiration 
bank credit facility activity is summarized below in millions years ended july  amount of banks amount of banks total beginning of year new expired not renewed increases total end of year renewed at expiration commercial paper we issue commercial paper direct and through a million program 
commercial paper is unsecured and matures between and days 
as a condition of our credit rating  our unused committed revolving bank credit facilities must exceed commercial paper outstanding 
therefore  at july   the combined amount of commercial paper and bank borrowings was limited to million million was outstanding at july  
information on the combined amounts of bank borrowings and commercial paper follows in millions fiscal maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year outstanding at end of year contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations and other pertinent information at july  are summarized below in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years term notes convertible debentures operating leases other long term liability reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total payments percentage other debt cumulative payments   cumulative scheduled collections of finance receivables    the weighted average maturity of our term debt term notes and convertible debentures was years and years at july  and  respectively 
term notes and convertible debentures are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and operating leases in note the other long term liability is deferred compensation 
other debt includes asset securitization financings  bank borrowings and commercial paper due within one year 
as shown in the table above  after one year cumulative scheduled collections of finance receivables exceed cumulative payments under contractual obligations 
stockholders equity we have a common stock and convertible debt repurchase program 
at july   million was available under the program 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of common stock for million 
in fiscal  we paid million of cash dividends and we received million from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits from stock awards 
market interest rate risk and sensitivity we discuss how changes in market interest rates affect our profitability and our approach to managing interest rate risk in this section 
higher short term market interest rates increased interest expense in fiscal by approximately million and reduced our net interest spread the net yield of finance receivables less the weighted average cost of borrowed funds  an integral part of a finance company s profitability  by approximately basis points 
we explain the reasons below 
our net interest spread is sensitive to changes in short term and long term market interest rates includes libor  rates on us treasury securities  money market rates  swap rates and the prime rate 
increases in short term rates reduce our net interest spread this is occurring currently and decreases in short term rates increase our net interest spread because floating rate debt includes short term debt significantly exceeds floating rate finance receivables 
since of our debt is floating rate and only of our finance receivables are floating rate  our cost of funds changes faster than the yield on our receivables 
our net interest spread is also affected when short term and long term rates do not similarly change 
long term rates normally exceed short term rates 
when the difference between long and short term rates narrows resulting in a flattening yield curve  our net interest spread should decrease and when the difference widens our net interest spread should increase because the rates we charge our customers are partially determined by long term market interest rates and rates on our floating rate debt are largely determined by short term market interest rates 
potential mitigating factors are i the rates we charge are also determined by the prime rate increased significantly during fiscal and equipment financing demand and ii issuing low rate long term debt 
our net interest spread is calculated below years ended july  net yield of finance receivables weighted average cost of borrowed funds net interest spread from the end of fiscal  short term market interest rates rose basis points and the yield curve flattened significantly 
these trends may continue 
rising short term market interest rates and a flattening yield curve cause our cost of funds to increase faster and by a greater amount than the yield on our receivables reducing our net interest spread 
although the yield on our finance receivables increased during fiscal  it remained below the yield in fiscal because of continued low long term market interest rates  and is increasing less than our cost of funds 
our earnings are subject to the risks of rising short term interest rates and a flattening yield curve at july  because floating rate debt exceeded floating rate receivables by million see the table below 
the terms and prepayment experience of our fixed rate receivables mitigate this risk 
finance receivables are repaid monthly over relatively short periods of two to five years that have been accelerated by prepayments 
at july   million of fixed rate finance receivables are due in one year and the weighted average remaining life of fixed rate finance receivables is approximately twenty months 
we do not match the maturities of our debt to our finance receivables 
fixed rate floating rate in millions amount percent amount percent total finance receivables   debt principal  stockholders equity total debt and equity  adjusted for the million august fixed rate term note issuance floating rate debt asset securitization financings  fixed rate term notes swapped to floating rates  bank borrowings  commercial paper and floating rate term note at july  adjusted for the august fixed rate term note issuance reprices interest rate changes as follows million within one month  million  in two months to three months and million  in four to eight months 
the repricing periods of floating rate debt adjusted for the august fixed rate term note issuance follow in millions amount repricing frequency asset securitization financings daily floating rate swaps of fixed rate notes semi annually bank borrowings generally daily commercial paper to days average days floating rate term note monthly we quantify interest rate risk by calculating the effect on net income of a hypothetical  immediate basis point rise in market interest rates 
at july   such a hypothetical adverse change in rates would reduce annual net income by approximately million based on scheduled repricings of floating rate debt and fixed rate debt maturing within one year  the expected effects on the yield of new receivables and the august fixed rate term note issuance 
we believe this is acceptable considering the lower cost of floating rate debt 
actual future changes in market interest rates and the effect on net income may differ materially from this amount 
in addition  other factors that may accompany an actual immediate basis point increase in market interest rates were not considered in the calculation 
we monitor and manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates through risk management procedures that include using certain derivative financial instruments and changing the proportion of our fixed and floating rate debt 
we may use derivatives to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on existing and forecast debt 
we do not speculate with or trade derivatives 
in fiscal  we refinanced million of floating rate term notes with fixed rate term notes maturing in five years to reduce our exposure to rising short term market interest rates 
in fiscal  we entered into two million interest rate locks 
we locked the rate on five year us treasury notes was trending higher at the time at for one month 
this rate determined the interest rate on our fiscal issuance of five year fixed rate term notes 
we chose not to designate the locks as hedging instruments because of their short duration and because we did not expect the settlement amount would be material 
we terminated the locks within three weeks of issuance when the interest rate was set on the term notes 
the five year treasury rate was at the time 
we received million from settling the locks and  since we did not designate the locks as hedges  we recognized this gain as a reduction of interest expense 
if we made the hedge designation  the million gain would have been deferred and recognized over the life of the term notes 
at july   floating rate swaps of fixed rate notes totaled million 
we receive fixed rates equal to the rates on the hedged notes and pay floating rates indexed to six month libor at july  
the swaps reduced interest expense by million in fiscal the current weighted average pay rate exceeded the weighted average receive rate by basis points at july  based on the current pay rate  the swaps will start to increase interest expense in fiscal information on the swaps at july  follows in millions notional receive issued expires amount rate pay rate reprices april april october july april october july june october july june october july june october august april october april august january new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that requires measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all stock awards 
sfas no 
r is effective for our fiscal quarter ending october  we are evaluating the impact sfas no 
r will have on our operating results and financial condition 
on september   the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
eitf no 
eliminated excluding convertible debentures with a contingent conversion feature in calculating diluted earnings per share 
our convertible debentures contain this feature 
in december  we irrevocably elected to pay the value of converted debentures  not exceeding the principal amount  in cash 
we will pay any value over principal with shares of common stock 
this eliminated the million shares of common stock issuable upon conversion 
as a result  eitf will not affect diluted earnings per share
