item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview national health realty  inc nhr or the company is a real estate investment trust reit that began operations on january  currently nhr  through its subsidiary nhr op  lp the operating partnership  owns the real estate of healthcare facilities  including licensed skilled nursing facilities  six assisted living facilities and one independent living center the healthcare facilities  and owns seven first promissory notes with principal balances totaling  the notes at december  and secured by the real property of healthcare facilities 
relationship with national healthcare corporation we have an advisory services agreement with national healthcare corporation nhc pursuant to which nhc will provide us with investment advice  office space and personnel 
nhc owns or manages a total of long term healthcare facilities with  beds in states 
nhc is nhr s primary tenant  operating ten licensed skilled nursing facilities  six assisted living facilities and one independent living center  the real estate of which facilities is owned by nhr 
investment restriction removed the nhr advisory agreement provides that we will not  without the prior approval of nhi  be actively or passively engaged in the pursuit of additional investment opportunities until the earlier of the termination of the advisory agreement or such time as nhc is no longer actively engaged as investment advisor to nhi 
nhc announced on november  that it is no longer the advisor to nhi 
therefore  the restriction on nhr s investment activities has been removed 
areas of focus management is currently focusing upon our capacities as landlord and note holder 
our objectives are to provide current income for distribution to stockholders  to provide the opportunity for additional returns to investors by participating in any increase in the operating revenues of our leased properties  to provide the opportunity to realize capital growth resulting from appreciation  if any  in the value of our portfolio properties  and to preserve and protect stockholder s capital 
we can offer no assurance that these objectives will be realized 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  we may in the future determine that  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  revenue for interest or rent is not realizable 
for any such nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income only in the period when payments are received 
if conclusions as to the realizibility of revenue change  our revenues could vary significantly from period to period 
valuations of and impairments to our investments since the passage of the balanced budget act of affecting skilled nursing facilities snfs january  the long term care industry has experienced material reductions in government and private insurance reimbursement 
some legislative relief was granted in and as a result of the balanced budget refinement act of  however  some of the add on provisions expired october  materially reducing reimbursement 
effective october   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued the annual market basket inflationary increase of for skilled nursing facilities reimbursement of medicare part a 
no material changes are expected until cms refines the current rug iii case mix methodology related to the clinical assessment of residents 
the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments about refinancing which have affected some of our lessees and mortgagees 
decisions about valuations and impairments of our investments require significant judgements and estimates on the part of management 
we monitor the liquidity and credit worthiness of our tenants and borrowers on an on going basis 
for real estate properties  the need to recognize an impairment is evaluated on a property by property basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recognition of an impairment is based upon estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of loan payments on a specific loan basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties and notes receivable are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to its stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
capital resources and liquidity at year end  our debt as a percentage of total liabilities and capital was 
our debt consists of a bank term loan in the amount of  which matures on may  the bank term loan requires quarterly payments of  and bears interest at the variable rate of day libor plus at december  
the loan agreements require that we maintain specified operating ratios and stockholders equity 
leases we lease our healthcare facilities to various lessees properties are leased to nhc  and nine properties that were previously leased to nhc prior to october  are leased to nine separate lessees not related to nhc 
with respect to these nine properties  nhc remains obligated under its master lease agreement and continues to remain obligated to make the lease payments to us 
lease payments made to us from the new lessees are credited against nhc s overall rent obligation 
at december   all payments are current 
our leases with nhc have initial ten year terms with provisions for two five year renewal terms at the same terms as the original lease 
our leases with the nine separate lessees have initial five year terms with provisions for two five year renewal terms for which the base lease payments must be negotiated on each renewal

the reduced interest on the credit facility was caused by paydowns in december and december in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
the reduction of interest on the credit facility was offset in part due to an increased rate effective january  during  we concluded that based on our statement of accounting standards no

funds from operations we have adopted the definition of funds from operations ffo prescribed by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit october white paper as amended april accordingly  ffo is defined as net income loss applicable to common stockholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation of real property and after investments for unconsolidated entities in which a reit holds an interest 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operations  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
we view ffo as a measure of operating performance and believe that ffo is helpful in evaluating a real estate investment portfolio s overall performance considering the fact that historical cost accounting implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
our funds from operations for the twelve months ended december   on a diluted basis was  an increase of  as compared to  for the same period in ffo represents net earnings available to common stockholders  excluding the effects of asset dispositions  plus depreciation associated with real estate investments 
diluted ffo assumes  if dilutive  the conversion of convertible subordinated debentures  the conversion of cumulative convertible preferred stock and the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method 
we believe that funds from operations is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative  and should be supplemented with a measure such as ffo 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our funds from operations may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits 
since other reits may not use our definition of ffo  caution should be exercised when comparing our company s ffo to that of other reits 
funds from operations in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap funds from operations does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and  therefore  should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance  or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap in the united states  as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs

however  the majority of the income of our lessees and borrowers is derived from the lessees participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
adverse changes in these programs or the inability of our lessees and borrowers to participate in these programs would have a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of our lessees and borrowers and their resultant ability to service their obligations to us 
none of our lessees or borrowers are in bankruptcy 
income taxes we intend at all times to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
therefore  we will not be subject to federal income tax provided we distribute at least of our annual reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet other requirements to continue to qualify as a reit 
accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes has been made in the consolidated financial statements 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in may the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is generally effective for nhr july  as originally issued  sfas would have required nhr to measure the minority interests in nhr op  lp on the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value at the balance sheet date  with a charge or credit to income specifically  interest expense for the change in carrying value during the period 
in november  the fasb deferred for an indefinite period the application of the classification and measurement guidance in sfas to noncontrolling interests in limited life subsidiaries such as nhr op  lp measurement of the minority interests in nhr op  lp at estimated fair value at each balance sheet date  if and when required  would result in significant volatility in nhr s financial position and results of operations 
in december the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised december fin r 
fin r provides guidance related to identifying variable interest entities previously known generally as special purpose entities or spes and determining whether such entities should be consolidated 
key to the consolidation determination is whether such entities disperse risks among the parties involved 
if those risks are not dispersed  and therefore an enterprise bears the majority of the risks or rewards related to the variable interest entity  it would consolidate that variable interest entity 
this interpretation also provides guidance related to the initial and subsequent measurement of assets  liabilities  and non controlling interests of newly consolidated variable interest entities and requires disclosures for both the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and other beneficiaries of the entity 
this interpretation replaces in its entirety fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  that was issued by the fasb in january the implementation of fin r was required during the company s first quarter of the implementation had no effect on the company s financial statements 
in december of  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
statement 
statement amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  that was issued in the amendments made by statement are based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that he accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the provisions in statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  early application is permitted and companies must apply the standard prospectively 
the company plans to adopt statement beginning july  the future effect of statement on the company s financial statements will depend on whether the company enters into certain non monetary transactions 
the company  however  does not expect the adoption of statement to have a significant impact on its financial statements

impact of inflation inflation may affect us in the future by changing the underlying value of our real estate or by impacting our cost of financing operations 
our revenues are primarily from long term investments 
our leases with nhc require increases in rent income based on increases in the revenues of the leased facilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months 
substantially all of our mortgage and other notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments and because the interest rates on our investment in notes receivable are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
as of december   all of our long term debt  bears interest at floating interest rates 
because the interest rates of these instruments are variable  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of  and a reduction in interest rates would result in annual interest expense declining  we currently do not use any derivative instruments to hedge interest rate or other risks 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the future use of such instruments would be subject to strict approvals by our senior officers 
therefore  our exposure related to such derivative instruments is not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
equity price risk we consider our investments in marketable securities as available for sale securities and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
hypothetically  a increase in quoted market prices would result in a related increase in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities of approximately  and reduction in quoted market prices would result in a related decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities of approximately
