item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview for a further discussion 
electric operations og e general the electric utility segment generates  transmits  distributes and sells electric energy in oklahoma and western arkansas 
its operations are conducted through og e 
og e furnishes retail electric service in communities and their contiguous rural and suburban areas 
during  seven other communities and five rural electric cooperatives in oklahoma and western arkansas purchased electricity from og e for resale 
the service area  with an estimated population of million  covers approximately  square miles in oklahoma and western arkansas  including oklahoma city  the largest city in oklahoma  and fort smith  arkansas  the second largest city in that state 
of the communities that og e serves  are located in oklahoma and in arkansas 
og e derived approximately percent of its total electric operating revenues for the year ended december  from sales in oklahoma and the remainder from sales in arkansas 
og e s system control area peak demand as reported by the system dispatcher during was approximately  mws on august  og e s load responsibility peak demand was approximately  mws on august   resulting in a capacity margin of approximately percent 
as reflected in the table below and in the operating statistics on page  there were approximately million megawatt hour mwh sales in as compared to approximately million in and million in mwh sales to og e s customers system sales decreased approximately percent in primarily due to milder weather during sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales remained flat in variances in off system sales are due in large part to the changing supply and demand needs on og e s generation system and the market for off system sales 
variations in mwh sales for the three years are reflected in the following table increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease system sales a off system sales a total sales a sales are in million of mwhs 
og e is subject to competition in various degrees from government owned electric systems  municipally owned electric systems  rural electric cooperatives and  in certain respects  from other private utilities  power marketers and cogenerators 
oklahoma law forbids the granting of an exclusive franchise to a utility for providing electricity 
besides competition from other suppliers or marketers of electricity  og e competes with suppliers of other forms of energy 
the degree of competition between suppliers may vary depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms of energy 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the potential impact on competition from federal and state legislation

the issuance of certain securities by og e is also regulated by the occ and the apsc 
og e s wholesale electric tariffs  short term borrowing authorization and accounting practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc 
the secretary of the department of energy has jurisdiction over some of og e s facilities and operations 
for the year ended december   approximately percent of og e s electric revenue was subject to the jurisdiction of the occ  nine percent to the apsc and four percent to the ferc 
the occ issued an order in authorizing og e to reorganize into a subsidiary of the company 
the order required that  among other things  i the company permit the occ access to the books and records of the company and its affiliates relating to transactions with og e  ii the company employ accounting and other procedures and controls to protect against subsidization of non utility activities by og e s customers  and iii the company refrain from pledging og e assets or income for affiliate transactions 
regulatory matters and plant acquisition in november  the occ issued an order containing provisions of an agreed upon settlement of og e s rate case 
the terms of this settlement included  among other things  a million annual reduction in electric rates and a requirement for og e to acquire mws of electric generation 
the rate reduction went into effect january  and the acquisition of a percent interest in the mw mcclain plant was completed on july  the mcclain plant  located near newcastle  oklahoma  is a combined cycle unit consisting of two natural gas fired combustion turbine generators combined with a steam turbine generator 
the owner of the remaining percent interest in the mcclain plant is the oklahoma municipal power authority 
og e operates the plant 
the purchase price was approximately million 
og e temporarily funded the mcclain plant acquisition with short term borrowings from the company 
on august   og e issued million of long term debt to replace these short term borrowings 
also  on august   the company made a capital contribution to og e of approximately million 
for additional information regarding the mcclain plant acquisition and related regulatory matters  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
regulatory assets and liabilities og e  as a regulated utility  is subject to the accounting principles prescribed by the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
provides that certain actual or anticipated costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets  based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates 
likewise  certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities  based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates 
management s expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment 
excluding recoverable take or pay gas charges  the mcclain plant operating and maintenance expenses  depreciation  ad valorem taxes and interest on debt  regulatory assets are being amortized and reflected in rates charged to customers over periods of up to years 
og e records certain actual or anticipated costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable  based on regulatory orders or other available evidence  that the cost or obligation will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates 
at december  and  og e had regulatory assets of approximately million and million  respectively  and regulatory liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  legislation was enacted in oklahoma and arkansas that was to restructure the electric utility industry in those states 
the arkansas legislation was repealed and implementation of the oklahoma restructuring legislation has been delayed and seems unlikely to proceed during the near future 
yet  if and when implemented  this legislation could deregulate og e s electric generation assets and cause og e to discontinue the use of sfas no 
with respect to its related regulatory balances 
this may result in either full recovery of generation related regulatory assets net of related regulatory liabilities or a non cash  pre tax write off as an extraordinary charge  depending on the transition mechanisms developed by the legislature for the recovery of all or a portion of these net regulatory assets 
the previously enacted oklahoma and arkansas legislation would not affect og e s electric transmission and distribution assets and og e believes that the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the related regulatory balances is appropriate 
however  if utility regulators in oklahoma and arkansas were to adopt regulatory methodologies in the future that are not based on the cost of service  the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the regulatory balances related to the electric transmission and distribution assets may no longer be appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes that its regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain regulatory matters including the gas transportation and storage contract between og e and enogex  security enhancements and national energy legislation 
rate activities and proposals in  og e concluded its oklahoma rate review proceeding before the occ 
this rate review was initiated in september by the occ staff and was concluded by order of the occ on november  og e received occ approval in the settlement of its rate case the settlement agreement for several new customer programs and rate options  as well as modifications to existing rate structures 
the guaranteed flat bill gfb option for residential and small general service accounts allows qualifying customers the opportunity to purchase their electricity needs at a set price for an entire year 
budget minded customers that desire a fixed monthly bill could benefit from the gfb option 
a second tariff rate option approved in the settlement agreement is an offering to provide a renewable energy resource to og e s oklahoma retail customers 
this renewable energy resource is a wind power purchase program and is available as a voluntary option to all of og e s oklahoma retail customers 
oklahoma s availability of wind resources makes the renewable wind power option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of our conservation minded customers 
a third new rate offering available to commercial and industrial customers is levelized demand billing 
this program is beneficial for medium to large size customers with seasonally consistent demand levels who wish to reduce the variability of their monthly electric bills 
the last new program being offered to og e s commercial and industrial customers and approved by the occ is a new voluntary load curtailment program 
this program provides customers with the opportunity to curtail on a voluntary basis when og e s system conditions merit curtailment action 
customers that curtail their usage will receive payment for their curtailment response 
this voluntary curtailment program seeks customers that can curtail on most curtailment event days  but may not be able to curtail every time that a curtailment event is required 
the previously discussed new rate options coupled with og e s existing rate choices provide many tariff options for og e s oklahoma retail customers 
og e s rate choice flexibility  reduction in cogeneration rates  acquisition of additional generation resources and overall low costs of production and deliverability are expected to provide valuable benefits for our customers for many years to come 
og e began implementation of the new rate options during the first billing cycle in january since many of these options are voluntary  customers may choose these options anytime after the january start date 
the revenue impacts associated with these options are indeterminate in future years since customers may choose to remain on existing rate options instead of volunteering for the new rate option choices 
there was no overall material impact in or associated with these new rate options  but minimal revenue variations may occur in the future based upon changes in customers usage characteristics if they choose these new programs 
in  over percent of the gfb pilot customers renewed for a second year under the program 
the pilot program has received favorable reviews and og e is currently considering a filing with the occ for permanent rate status in the second quarter of fuel supply during  approximately percent of the og e generated energy was produced by coal units and percent by natural gas units 
of the  total mw capability reflected in the table under item properties  approximately  mws  or percent  are from natural gas generation and approximately  mws  or percent  are from coal generation 
though og e has a higher installed capability of generation from natural gas units  it has been more economical to generate electricity for our customers using lower priced coal 
a slight decline in the percentage of coal generation in future years is expected to result from increased usage of natural gas generation required to meet growing energy needs 
over the last five years  the weighted average cost of fuel used  by type  per million british thermal unit mmbtu was as follows coal natural gas weighted average the increase in the weighted average cost of fuel in as compared to was primarily due to increased natural gas prices and a higher amount of natural gas burned in while the increase in the weighted average cost of fuel in as compared to was primarily due to increased natural gas prices in partially offset by a lower amount of natural gas burned in the decrease in the weighted average cost of fuel in as compared to was primarily due to lower natural gas prices in partially offset by a higher amount of natural gas burned in a portion of these fuel costs is included in the base rates to customers and differs for each jurisdiction 
the portion of these fuel costs that is not included in the base rates is recovered through og e s regulatorily approved automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
og e currently has pending before the occ an application to recover the costs of gas transportation and storage services provided to it by enogex pursuant to the contract between og e and enogex 
an adverse decision by the occ could result in og e having to refund previously collected amounts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this matter 
coal all of og e s coal units  with an aggregate capability of approximately  mws  are designed to burn low sulfur western coal 
og e purchases coal primarily under long term contracts expiring in and during  og e purchased approximately million tons of coal from the following wyoming suppliers kennecott energy company  arch coal inc  peabody coal sales company and triton coal company 
the combination of all coal has a weighted average sulfur content of less than percent and can be burned in these units under existing federal  state and local environmental standards maximum of lbs 
of sulfur dioxide per mmbtu without the addition of sulfur dioxide removal systems 
based upon the average sulfur content  og e s coal units have an approximate emission rate of lbs 
of sulfur dioxide per mmbtu  well within the limitations of the provisions of the clean air act 
og e has continued its efforts to maximize the utilization of its coal units at both its sooner and muskogee generating plants 
see environmental laws and regulations in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of an environmental proposal that  if implemented as proposed  could inhibit og e s ability to use coal as its primary boiler fuel 
natural gas in april  og e utilized a request for bid rfb to acquire approximately percent and percent of its projected annual natural gas requirements for and  respectively 
all of these contracts are tied to various gas price market indices and most will expire in december additional natural gas supply for the summer of will be secured through a new rfb issued in the first quarter of og e will meet additional natural gas requirements with monthly and daily purchases as required 
in  og e began utilizing a natural gas storage facility that allowed og e to maximize the value of its generation assets  which storage services are now provided by enogex as part of enogex s gas transportation and storage contract with og e 
wind during  og e contracted with fpl energy for mws of electricity generated at a wind farm near woodward  oklahoma 
after more than one year of marketing wind power to og e s residential and business customers  almost  have subscribed for all or part of their electricity usage 
since og e last requested bids to determine the cost of adding wind to its system  natural gas prices have continued to rise and federal renewable energy tax credits have been extended 
og e is exploring adding another mws of wind generated electricity to its system and  in december  og e issued a request for proposals from companies who produce electricity from wind 
og e expects to use the proposal responses to conduct a thorough analysis of how adding more wind will affect customers today and in the future 
a decision is expected during the first or second quarter of natural gas pipeline operations enogex overview the operations of the natural gas pipeline segment are conducted through enogex and consist of three related businesses i the transportation and storage of natural gas  ii the gathering and processing of natural gas and iii the marketing of natural gas 
enogex s focus is to utilize its gathering  processing  transportation and storage capacity to execute physical  financial and service transactions to capture margins across different commodities  locations or time periods 
the vast majority of enogex s natural gas gathering  processing  transportation and storage assets are located in the major gas producing basins of oklahoma 
enogex and its subsidiaries operate approximately  miles of intrastate gas gathering and transportation pipelines 
additionally  through a percent interest in noark  enogex also owns a controlling interest in and operates a mile gas gathering and interstate transmission pipeline system of which miles is comprised of a ferc regulated interstate pipeline  ozark  that extends from southeast oklahoma through arkansas to southeast missouri 
enogex was previously engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas  however  this portion of enogex s business  along with interests in certain gas gathering and processing assets in texas  was sold in and in the first quarter of and are reported in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
strategy the transportation  storage and gathering assets of enogex provide og e strategic access to natural gas supplies  and flexible and reliable delivery terms that are required to fuel og e s natural gas fired generation facilities 
natural gas generation peaking units require the ability to quickly change their status  to meet both the peak and off peak demands of the retail load particularly when coal units have an unscheduled outage 
the gathering assets access major wellhead supply sources primarily located across oklahoma and arkansas  and the integrated transportation and storage assets provide the ability to regulate the receipt and delivery of natural gas to match the instantaneous needs of these generation units 
natural gas fired generation units contribute their highest value when they have the capability to provide load following service to the customer ie  the ability of the generation unit to regulate generation to respond to and meet the instantaneous changes in customer demand 
while the physical characteristics of natural gas units are known to provide quick start up and on line functionality  and while their ability to efficiently provide varying levels of electric generation relative to other forms of generation is further acknowledged  their ultimate effectiveness is contingent upon having access to an integrated pipeline and storage system that can respond in a short term fashion to meet its corresponding fluctuating operational fuel requirements 
the combination of these assets is critical to a generator s ability to provide reliable generation service at reasonable prices to the consumer 
not only is enogex providing service to og e  but enogex s same assets provide firm and interruptible services to a significant portion of the other natural gas fired generation loads in oklahoma and other generation loads in texas and arkansas 
enogex understands the needs of generators  and more importantly has the appropriately sized pipelines  compression and integrated storage assets necessary to meet their requirements 
through enogex s gathering and processing assets  enogex aggregates gas supplies for its markets and also for those markets accessible via its numerous intrastate and interstate pipeline connections 
it aggressively pursues new supplies from wells drilled by producers primarily in the anadarko and arkoma basins 
oklahoma ranks second in the nation in onshore natural gas production and ranks second in the nation as a natural gas exporting state 
the system capacity  due to its large diameter gathering pipelines and its natural gas processing plants  is capable of adapting to the varying pressure and quality requirements of mid continent production 
enogex is able to provide low pressure service to extend the production life of older wells as well as meeting the high pressure requirements of new exploration 
enogex  through its processing plants  is also able to remove natural gas liquids from the wellhead gas streams  which is necessary for such gas to meet quality specifications of the downstream marketplace 
the activities described above  while central to enogex s operations  are not its only businesses 
the transportation capabilities and markets of the pipeline assets provide other business opportunities 
this equally important and valuable feature of enogex and its assets is the ability of enogex to use its pipeline system and storage assets as a market hub 
at december   enogex was connected to other major pipelines at approximately pipeline interconnect points providing access to markets in the western united states  the midwest  northeast  and gulf coast in addition to oklahoma and adjoining states 
therefore  regardless of the constantly varying relationship between supply and demand  both in volume and location  enogex s assets sit in a key geographic region of the united states  with sufficient capacity to provide cross haul transportation and storage services to a variety of utility and industrial customers that need to access mid continent supply for their own needs  or to suppliers from other regions seeking to provide gas to on system markets which enogex serves 
enogex s marketing business is an important element in realizing the full value of its transportation and storage assets and in providing products and services that support the market hub concept 
the marketing business offers the company real time and longer term price discovery and valuation of energy commodities natural gas and associated natural gas liquids associated with the company s assets 
the marketing business also is instrumental in providing increased liquidity for these energy commodities  by focusing on developing supplies and markets that can access the enogex systems either directly or via interconnections with intrastate and interstate pipelines 
the marketing business also provides the company the capability to provide risk management services to its customers 
the company intends to continue to build upon the foundation of services and products that these assets can provide 
in addition  the company expects to generate additional margins by improving its ability to aggregate gas  maximize the operational capabilities of its assets and utilize commercial information available from the marketplace 
recent actions beginning in  enogex evaluated  redesigned and reorganized its internal work processes and senior management structure in order to achieve cost reductions  revenue enhancements and strategic leadership within its businesses 
as a part of this process  enogex implemented a number of steps intended to maximize the value of its assets 
dispositions exploration and production  processing 
enogex sold all of its exploration and production assets and its interest in belvan corp  belvan limited partnership and todd ranch limited partnership belvan in and its interest in the nustar joint venture nustar in february these dispositions have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated financial statements 
processing and compression assets 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million in the natural gas pipeline segment related to enogex natural gas processing and compression assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million related to these natural gas compression assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these impairments 
during the year ended december   the company sold certain of its compression and processing assets for approximately million and recognized an after tax gain of approximately million related to the sale of these assets 
the carrying amount of the remaining assets that were the subject of the impairment charges in the fourth quarters of and was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
as discussed below  for any remaining assets that were the subject of the impairment charges in the fourth quarters of and  the company has either contributed the assets to the joint venture or reclassified these assets from held for sale to held and used as of december  during the third quarter of  enogex entered into a joint venture arrangement with a third party and contributed certain of its natural gas compression assets with a carrying amount of approximately million to the joint venture 
the objective of the joint venture is to derive value from the assets by renting the natural gas compressors 
enogex compression company  llc enogex compression was created to act as the participating entity in the joint venture 
enogex compression holds a majority ownership in the joint venture  although the actual ownership percentages may fluctuate based on the relative capital contributions of enogex compression and the third party member 
the third party acts as the manager and conducts the daily operations of the joint venture 
these assets are part of the natural gas pipeline segment 
during the third quarter of  the company reclassified an asset from assets held for sale to assets held and used 
this asset had a carrying amount of approximately million at the time the asset was reclassified 
in october  the company reclassified a large electric driven compressor that was previously classified as assets held for sale to assets held and used 
this compressor had a carrying amount of approximately million at september  in december  the company reclassified several compressors and processing plants that were previously classified as assets held for sale to assets held and used 
these assets had a carrying amount of approximately million at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these reclassifications 
transportation and storage 
during september  enogex received notification from a customer that a transportation agreement involving four of enogex s non contiguous pipeline asset segments located in west texas and used to serve the customer s power plants would be terminated effective december  in response to this notification  the company recognized  during the third quarter of  a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million in the natural gas pipeline segment related to enogex natural gas pipeline assets that were used to provide service to this customer 
in december  the company received notification that all of this customers plants in west texas had shut down and service is no longer required 
the company is currently evaluating other commercial opportunities for these assets as well as contacting other parties that may be interested in acquiring any of these assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this impairment 
in january  ozark recognized a gain of approximately million and approximately million in minority interest expense related to the sale of approximately miles of transmission lines of its pipeline 
capital expenditures  improvement projects 
in  enogex began a major upgrade of its information systems that is expected to be substantially completed during the second and third quarters of enogex believes that these upgrades will be a major step towards obtaining the data required to allow it to capture available economic opportunities on its assets  provide improved customer service and enable management to better determine the earnings potential of its various assets and service offerings 
during  enogex made improvements to the stuart storage facility which reduced water encroachment in the field 
during  approximately million in capital expenditures was spent on this project 
enogex does not expect any material future expenditures on this water encroachment project 
in december  enogex entered into an agreement with colorado interstate gas company regarding reservation of firm capacity on an interstate gas pipeline that was initially proposed to be in service by august  the cheyenne plains pipeline 
under the final transportation agreement  oge energy resources  inc oeri reserved  decatherms day dth day of capacity on the pipeline for years and two months 
such reservation provides oeri access to significant additional natural gas supplies in the rocky mountain production basins 
the cheyenne plains pipeline  which began full service in february  provides interstate gas transportation services in wyoming  colorado and kansas with a capacity of  dth day 
oeri pays a demand fee of approximately million annually for this capacity 
transportation and storage general 
one of enogex s primary lines of business is the transportation of natural gas  with current throughput of approximately trillion british thermal units btu per day 
enogex delivers natural gas to most interstate and intrastate pipelines and end users connected to its systems from the arkoma basin of eastern oklahoma and arkansas  the anadarko basin of western oklahoma and the panhandle of west texas 
at december   enogex was connected to other major pipelines at approximately pipeline interconnect points 
these interconnections include panhandle eastern pipe line  southern star central gas pipeline formerly williams central  natural gas pipeline company of america  oneok gas transmission  northern natural gas company  anr pipeline  western farmers electric cooperative  centerpoint energy gas transmission co  black marlin pipeline  el paso natural gas pipeline  kansas pipeline and oneok westex transmission lp  as well as connections via enogex s ozark system to texas eastern and mississippi river transmission 
further  enogex is connected to various end users including numerous electric generation facilities in oklahoma that are fueled by natural gas 
at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s transportation and storage business was approximately million 
enogex owns two storage facilities in oklahoma  the wetumka storage facility and the stuart storage facility 
these storage facilities are currently being operated at a working gas level of approximately billion cubic feet bcf with an approximate withdrawal capability of million cubic feet per day mmcfd and similar injection capability 
enogex offers both firm and interruptible storage services to third parties  under section of the natural gas policy act ngpa  under terms and conditions specified in its statement of operating conditions soc for gas storage and at market based rates to be negotiated with each customer 
both facilities are used to support enogex s intrastate transportation and storage services for og e 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of the legal matters associated with the stuart storage facility 
enogex offers interruptible section transportation services as well as both firm and interruptible services to intrastate customers with a majority of transportation revenues derived from firm contracts 
enogex offers interruptible service to customers when capacity is available 
effective january   transok llc and its subsidiary entities transok  which enogex had acquired in  merged into enogex thereby simplifying for both enogex and its customers the administration and operation of maintaining two separate pipelines 
enogex provides firm intrastate transportation and storage services to several customers and enogex s major customers are og e as well as public service company of oklahoma pso  the second largest electric utility in oklahoma  serving the tulsa market 
enogex provides gas transmission delivery services to all of pso s natural gas fired electric generation units in oklahoma under a firm intrastate transportation contract 
the current pso contract  which has been extended to january   and the og e contract  which expires april   provide for a monthly demand charge plus variable transportation charges including fuel 
as part of the contract with og e  enogex provides additional natural gas storage services for og e 
enogex has been providing natural gas storage services since august when enogex acquired the stuart storage facility from central oklahoma oil and gas corp 
coog 
during  and  enogex s revenues from its firm intrastate transportation and storage contracts were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
relationship with og e 
from its inception  enogex has been the transporter of natural gas to og e s natural gas fired generation facilities 
og e s rates are subject to occ jurisdiction 
the occ issued an order on november  which contained a provision  among other things  that og e would consider competitive bidding for gas transportation service to its natural gas fired generation facilities when the contract with enogex expired 
the term of the then current contract was to expire in april following a consideration of competitive bidding by og e as required by the prior order from the occ  the contract with enogex was amended by an agreement dated may  with no notice load following requirements and a termination date of april  as part of the contract with og e  enogex provides additional natural gas storage services for og e beyond the level and flexibility that was provided previously 
enogex has been providing natural gas storage services since august when enogex acquired the stuart storage facility from coog 
the amount collected from og e by enogex under the current contract for transportation services was approximately million  million and million  respectively  during  and the amount collected from og e by enogex under the current contract for storage services was approximately million  million and million  respectively  during  and og e currently has pending before the occ an application to recover the costs of gas transportation and storage services provided to it by enogex pursuant to the contract between og e and enogex 
an adverse decision by the occ could result in og e having to refund previously collected amounts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this matter 
competition 
enogex s transportation and storage assets compete with interstate and other intrastate pipeline and storage facilities in providing transportation and storage services for natural gas 
the principal elements of competition are rates  terms of services  flexibility and reliability of service 
natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to enogex s customers and end users  including electricity  coal and fuel oils 
the primary competitive factor is price 
changes in the availability or price of natural gas or other forms of energy as well as weather and other factors affect the demand for natural gas on the enogex system 
regulation 
the rates charged by enogex for transporting natural gas on behalf of an interstate natural gas pipeline company or a local distribution company served by an interstate natural gas pipeline company are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under section of the ngpa 
rates to provide such service must be fair and equitable under the ngpa and are subject to review and approval by the ferc at least once every three years 
this rate review may  but will not necessarily  involve an administrative type hearing before the ferc staff panel and an administrative appellate review 
by offering interruptible section transportation  the regulatory burden on enogex is not appreciably increased  but does give enogex the opportunity to utilize any unused capacity on an interruptible basis in interstate commerce and thus increase its transportation revenues 
in december  enogex made its triennial rate filing at the ferc under section of the ngpa 
enogex also proposed a default processing fee and addressed various other issues for the combined enogex and transok llc pipeline systems 
in may  the ferc accepted a stipulation and settlement agreement and entered an order modifying enogex s soc with respect to priority dedicated gas 
on september   enogex made a filing at the ferc to revise the soc approved in the case  to permit  among other things  the unbundling  effective october   of its previously bundled gathering and transportation services 
on september   enogex made its triennial filing to establish rates for section service  reflecting the unbundling of the transportation and gathering services 
numerous parties intervened in the soc and section dockets and some parties protested one or both of the filings 
the proceedings are currently in the discovery phase 
a technical conference was held on january  for additional information regarding this matter  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company  through enogex  owns a percent interest in ozark 
ozark transports natural gas in interstate commerce 
as a result  ozark qualifies as a natural gas company under the natural gas act of the natural gas act  and is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the ferc 
under the natural gas act  the ferc has jurisdiction to review and authorize the proposed construction of facilities for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce  the rendition of service through interstate facilities  the rates charged for such service and the abandonment of such facilities or services 
the natural gas act requires that the rates charged  and the terms and conditions of service observed  by interstate pipelines be just and reasonable  and not unduly discriminatory or preferential 
all rates and terms and conditions of service proposed by an interstate pipeline must be filed with the ferc  and the ferc has jurisdiction under the natural gas act to determine whether proposed rates or terms and conditions meet the statutory standards 
the natural gas act confers upon the ferc authority to determine a jurisdictional pipeline s rates  charges and terms and conditions of service  to establish depreciation rates and to prescribe uniform systems of accounts 
the rates charged by enogex for transporting natural gas for og e and other shippers within oklahoma are not subject to ferc regulation because they are intrastate transactions 
with respect to state regulation  the rates charged by enogex for any intrastate transportation service have not been subject to direct state regulation by the occ  which is the state agency responsible for setting rates of public utilities within oklahoma 
even though the intrastate pipeline business of enogex is not directly regulated by the occ  the occ  the apsc and the ferc all of which approve various electric rates of og e have the authority to examine the appropriateness of any transportation charges or other fees paid by og e to enogex which og e seeks to recover from its ratepayers in its cost of service for electric service 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of og e s application to the occ to approve amounts currently being charged to og e by enogex for gas transportation and storage services 
enogex s pipeline operations are subject to various oklahoma safety and environmental and non discriminatory transportation requirements 
gathering and processing general 
natural gas gathering operations are conducted through enogex gas gathering llc gathering  and natural gas processing operations are conducted through enogex products corporation products 
the streams of processable natural gas gathered from wells and other sources are gathered through enogex s gas gathering systems and delivered to processing plants for the extraction of natural gas liquids 
during  gathering connected new producing wells  located in the anadarko and arkoma basins of oklahoma and arkansas  to its gathering systems 
the company provides connection  measurement  treating  dehydration and compression services for various types of producing wells owned by various sized producers who are active in the region 
where the quality of natural gas received dictates that removal of natural gas liquids may be in order  such gas is aggregated via the gathering system to the inlet of one or more of the company s fleet of processing plants operated by products 
the resulting processed stream of natural gas is then delivered via the enogex pipeline system to one or more delivery points into the web of transmission pipelines in the region 
products is one of the largest gas processors in oklahoma  operating six natural gas processing plants with a total inlet capacity of mmcfd 
during  products had ownership interests in two other gas processing plants related to nustar  which were sold in february products has been active since in the processing of natural gas and extraction and marketing of natural gas liquids 
the liquids extracted include condensate  marketable ethane  propane  butanes and natural gasoline mix 
the residue gas remaining after the liquid products have been extracted consists primarily of ethane and methane 
in  approximately million gallons of natural gas liquids were sold 
enogex continues to lease a small segment of gathering pipeline off of the palo duro pipeline system  referred to as the northeast lateral 
this lease expires february   and  enogex does not expect to renew the lease 
at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s gathering and processing business was approximately million 
approximately percent of the commercial grade propane processed at products plants is sold on the local market 
the balance of propane and the other natural gas liquids produced by products are delivered into pipeline facilities of koch hydrocarbon and transported to conway  kansas and mont belvieu  texas  where they are sold under contract or on the spot market 
ethane  which may be optionally produced at all of products plants except one  is sold in the spot market 
during  enogex initiated steps to decrease the volatility of its earnings stream by reducing its exposure to keep whole processing arrangements 
keep whole processing arrangements generally require a processor of natural gas to keep its shippers whole on a btu basis by replacing the btu value of the liquids extracted from the well stream with natural gas at market prices 
therefore  if natural gas prices increase and liquids prices do not increase by a corresponding amount  processing margins are negatively affected 
in order to minimize the negative impact on processing margins  ethane and propane are rejected based upon then current market conditions 
exposure to these keep whole processing arrangements was reduced through contract renegotiations and changes in the soc provided by enogex under the ferc section filing discussed previously 
the soc provides for a default processing fee in the event the natural gas liquids revenue less the associated fuel and shrinkage costs is negative 
as a result  in months in which commodity spreads were negative  thus activating the default processing fee allowed in the soc  the exposure to keep whole processing arrangements has been reduced 
further  when market conditions dictated  enogex took active steps to reduce the amount of natural gas at the plant inlet to approximately percent keep whole without the default processing fee 
in addition  the company actively monitors current and future commodity prices for opportunities to hedge its processing margin 
enogex uses forward physical sales and financial hedges to capture these spreads 
as discussed above  the company sold all of its interest in belvan in and its interest in nustar in february competition 
enogex competes with gatherers of all types and sizes  including those affiliated with various producers  other major pipeline companies  as well as various independent gatherers 
in processing and marketing natural gas liquids  products competes against virtually all other gas processors producing and selling natural gas liquids 
competition for natural gas supply is based on efficiency and reliability of operations  reputation  access to markets and pricing 
enogex believes it will be able to continue to compete effectively 
with respect to the profitability of the natural gas processing industry generally  if the price of natural gas liquids falls without a corresponding decrease in the cost of natural gas  it may become uneconomical to extract certain natural gas liquids 
this factor has had a significant adverse impact on the results of enogex in the past  but  as discussed above  the potential adverse impact has been materially mitigated  but not entirely eliminated 
in addition to the commodity pricing impact that affects the entire industry  the profitability of products is also largely affected by the volume of natural gas processed at its plants which is highly dependent upon the volume and btu content of natural gas gathered 
generally  if the volume of natural gas gathered increases  then the volume of natural gas liquids extracted by products should also increase 
marketing general 
enogex s commodity sales and services related to natural gas are conducted primarily through its subsidiary  oeri 
oeri is engaged in the business of natural gas marketing 
oeri provides marketing services to enogex for natural gas volumes purchased at the wellhead from customers 
as a service to the producers on the enogex system  enogex may agree to purchase the gas at the wellhead in conjunction with gathering their gas for transportation to other markets 
oeri also purchases and sells natural gas pursuant to contracts with enogex and products relating to enogex s gathering  processing and storage assets 
at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s marketing business was approximately million 
oeri focuses on serving customers along the natural gas value chain  from producers to end users  by purchasing natural gas from suppliers and reselling to pipelines  local distribution companies and end users  including the electric generation sector 
the geographic scope of marketing efforts has been focused largely in the mid continent area of the united states 
these markets are natural extensions of oeri s business on the enogex system 
oeri contracts for pipeline capacity with enogex and other pipelines to access multiple interconnections with the interstate pipeline system network that moves natural gas from the production basins primarily in the south central united states to the major consumption areas in chicago  new york and other north central and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
also  enogex s marketing business has expanded into the gulf coast  rocky mountain and east coast markets to diversify its business 
oeri participates in both intermediate term markets less than three years and short term spot markets for natural gas 
although oeri continues to increase its focus on intermediate term sales  short term sales of natural gas are expected to continue to play a critical role in the overall strategy because they provide an important source of market intelligence as well as an important portfolio balancing function 
in  oeri s average daily sales volumes grew from approximately bcf in to bcf of natural gas 
oeri s risk management skills afford its customers the opportunity to tailor the risk profile and composition of their natural gas portfolio 
the company follows a policy of hedging price risk on gas purchases or sales contracts entered into by the marketing group by buying and selling natural gas futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange futures exchange and other derivatives in the over the counter market  subject to daily and monthly trading stop loss limits of million in accordance with corporate policies 
competition 
oeri competes in marketing natural gas with major integrated oil companies  marketing affiliates of major interstate and intrastate pipelines  national and local natural gas brokers and marketers and distributors for natural gas supplies 
competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on reputation  credit support  the availability of gathering and transportation to high demand markets and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for the producer s natural gas 
competition for sales to customers is based primarily upon reliability  services offered and the price of delivered natural gas 
for the year ended december   approximately percent of oeri s service volumes were with electric utilities  local gas distribution companies  pipelines and producers 
the remaining percent of service volumes were to marketers  municipals  cooperatives and industrials 
at december   approximately percent of the payment exposure was to companies having investment grade ratings with standard poor s ratings services standard poor s and approximately percent having less than investment grade ratings 
the remaining percent of oeri s exposure is with privately held companies  municipals or cooperatives that were not rated by standard poor s 
oeri applies internal credit analyses and policies to these non rated companies

og e has been sued by kaiser francis oil company in district court  blaine county  oklahoma 
this case has been pending for more than years 
plaintiff alleges that og e breached the terms of numerous contracts covering approximately wells by failing to purchase gas from plaintiff in amounts set forth in the contracts 
plaintiff seeks million in take or pay damages and million in underpayment damages 
over the objection and unsuccessful appeal by og e  plaintiff has been permitted to amend its petition to include a claim based on theories of tort 
specifically  plaintiff alleges  among other things  that og e intentionally and tortuously interfered with contracts by falsifying documents  sponsoring false testimony and putting forward legal defenses  which are known by og e to be without merit 
if successful  plaintiff believes that these theories could give plaintiff a basis to seek punitive damages 
this lawsuit was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal that og e filed in a similar case brought by kaiser francis in grady county 
in the grady case  the plaintiff alleged that og e breached the terms of several gas purchase contracts in amounts set forth in the contracts 
in  the district court rendered a verdict against og e in the amount of approximately million  including pre judgment interest and attorneys fees 
og e filed an appeal and on may   the court of appeals issued an opinion reversing the judgment and remanding for a new trial 
the appellate court found that the trial court committed reversible error in rejecting a portion of og e s interpretation of the commercial well provisions of the gas purchase contracts  and in failing to recognize issues of fact for the jury relating to og e s contention regarding the correct initial reserve estimate on one of the natural gas wells  the thiel no in addition  the appellate court made rulings favorable to og e relating to the statutory measure of damages  the effect of line pressure adjustment provisions in the contracts  and the admission of certain hearsay evidence 
the appellate court made rulings favorable to kaiser francis relating to the effect of royalty payment obligations on the amount of damages  the effect of the amount of reserves owned by kaiser francis in the wells on og e s gas purchase obligation  the propriety of the award of prejudgment interest  and og e s liability for the payment of gross production taxes pertaining to the damages awarded 
the appellate court returned an issue relating to the alleged effect of kaiser francis s failure to make gas available for consideration by the trial court 
finally  the appellate court denied kaiser francis s request for appeal related attorney s fees and costs 
on july   the court of appeals denied kaiser francis s motion for rehearing 
both parties filed petitions for certiorari with the oklahoma supreme court for the review of those portions of the appellate court s opinion unfavorable to each 
the oklahoma supreme court denied both parties petitions for certiorari on january  once the mandate issues from the oklahoma supreme court  this case will be sent back to the district court of grady county for further proceedings consistent with the decision of the court of appeals 
in the blaine county case  once the mandate issues from the oklahoma supreme court in the grady county appeal  the parties will have days to notify the trial judge in the district court of blaine county that the appeal is over 
at that time  the trial judge is likely to lift the stay that has been in effect since june  og e believes that  to the extent plaintiff were successful on the merits of its claims of og e s failure to take gas in either the blaine county case or grady county case  these amounts would be recoverable through its regulated electric rates 
the claims related to tortuous conduct  which og e believes at this time are without merit  would not appear to be recoverable in its electric rates 
national steel corporation national steel voluntarily filed for chapter bankruptcy protection from creditors in oeri provided gas supply services to national steel and was an unsecured creditor of national steel

in march  national steel filed an adversary proceeding in the pending bankruptcy against oeri seeking the refund and return of payments made by national steel to oeri during the days preceding its bankruptcy filing totaling approximately million 
a settlement of the pending bankruptcy issues was reached in october between the parties wherein oeri agreed to not pursue its claim in the bankruptcy approximately a  claim based on the filed bankruptcy plan in exchange for national steel dismissing the pending preference claim

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction oge energy corp 
collectively  with its subsidiaries  the company is an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and management of both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central united states 
the company conducts these activities through two business segments  the electric utility and the natural gas pipeline segments 
the electric utility segment generates  transmits  distributes and sells electric energy in oklahoma and western arkansas 
its operations are conducted through oklahoma gas and electric company og e and are subject to regulation by the oklahoma corporation commission occ  the arkansas public service commission apsc and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
og e was incorporated in under the laws of the oklahoma territory and is the largest electric utility in oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes the fort smith  arkansas area 
og e sold its retail gas business in and is no longer engaged in the gas distribution business 
the operations of the natural gas pipeline segment are conducted through enogex inc and its subsidiaries enogex and consist of three related businesses i the transportation and storage of natural gas  ii the gathering and processing of natural gas and iii the marketing of natural gas 
enogex s focus is to utilize its gathering  processing  transportation and storage capacity to execute physical  financial and service transactions to capture margins across different commodities  locations or time periods 
the vast majority of enogex s natural gas gathering  processing  transportation and storage assets are located in the major gas producing basins of oklahoma 
through a percent interest in the noark pipeline system limited partnership noark  enogex also owns a controlling interest in and operates ozark gas transmission  llc ozark  a ferc regulated interstate pipeline that extends from southeast oklahoma through arkansas to southeast missouri 
enogex was previously engaged in the exploration and production of natural gas  however  this portion of enogex s business  along with interests in certain gas gathering and processing assets in texas  was sold in and in the first quarter of and are reported in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
executive overview in early  the company completed a review of its business strategy that was largely driven by the anticipated deregulation of the retail electric markets in oklahoma and arkansas 
due to a variety of factors  the company recognized that immediate deregulation of the retail electric markets in oklahoma and arkansas was very unlikely and revised its business strategy 
in the summer of  the company again reviewed its business strategy in light of significant changing market and regulatory trends such as the over supply of electric generation  the evolution of electric transmission markets and rules  the natural gas supply forecast  the sustained increase of natural gas commodity prices and the anticipated emergence of liquefied natural gas 
the company concluded that its existing business strategy of utilizing a diversified asset position was the proper course 
during  the company had several significant accomplishments including the completion of the acquisition of a percent interest in the megawatt mw nrg mcclain station the mcclain plant in july  the completion of two revolving credit agreements totaling million for the company and og e in october  improved financial performance at enogex  improved financial flexibility associated with the reduction of the long term debt balance at enogex  such that enogex began to contribute to funding the company s dividend which has been funded solely by og e in the past 
looking at  og e expects to file a rate case during the second quarter of to recover  among other things  its investment in  and the operating expenses of  the mcclain plant and expects new approved rates to be in effect by january also  during  og e will work to advance its customer savings and reliability plan which provides for increased investment at the utility to improve reliability and meet load growth  replace infrastructure equipment and deploy newer technology that improves operational and environmental performance 
capacity payment savings from reduced cogeneration payments and fuel savings from the mcclain plant will be utilized to mitigate the price increases associated with these investments 
for additional information regarding the mcclain plant acquisition and related regulatory matters  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the company will also be focused on controlling and managing operating and maintenance expenses and will continue to analyze the cost structure of the company s businesses ensuring consistency with the company s business model 
at enogex during  the company will focus on enhancing its financial position and the operations of its mid continent assets as well as seeking to expand into other geographic areas outside of the mid continent area 
overall  the company has a strong commitment to train and retain talented personnel so that both the company and its employees are successful in improving the financial and operating performance of the company 
the company s vision is to be a regional energy company focused on its regulated utility business and natural gas pipeline business that is recognized for operational excellence and financial performance 
the company intends to maintain the majority of its assets in the regulated utility business complemented by its natural gas pipeline business 
the company s long term financial goals include earnings growth of four to five percent on a normalized basis  a dividend payout ratio below percent and an a credit rating 
at enogex  the company plans to continue to implement improvements to enhance long term financial performance of its mid continent assets through more efficient operations and effective commercial management of the assets 
in addition  enogex is seeking to diversify its gathering  processing and transportation businesses principally by expanding into other geographic areas that are complementary with the company s strategic capabilities 
enogex s marketing business  which concentrates principally on origination of physical sales of natural gas  has expanded into the gulf coast  rocky mountain and east coast markets 
the company s business strategy is to continue maintaining the diversified asset position of og e and enogex so as to provide competitive energy products and services to customers primarily in the south central united states 
the company will focus on those products and services with limited or manageable commodity exposure 
the company intends for og e to continue as a vertically integrated utility engaged in the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity and to represent over time approximately percent of the company s consolidated assets 
the remainder of the company s consolidated assets will be in enogex s businesses 
at december   og e and enogex represented approximately percent and percent  respectively  of the company s consolidated assets 
the remaining one percent of the company s consolidated assets were primarily at the holding company 
in addition to the incremental growth opportunities that enogex provides  the company believes that many of the risk management practices  commercial skills and market information available from enogex provide value to all of the company s businesses subject to the evolving federal regulations of the ferc in regard to the operations of the wholesale power market 
in addition  oklahoma and arkansas legislatures and utility commissions may propose changes from time to time that could subject utilities to market risk 
accordingly  the company is applying risk management practices to all of its operations in an effort to mitigate the potential adverse effect of any future regulatory changes 
og e has approximately mws of contracts with qualified cogeneration facilities and small power production producers qf contracts that will expire at the end of  unless extended by og e 
in addition  effective september   og e entered into a new year power sales agreement for mws with powersmith cogeneration project  lp powersmith 
og e will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to these expiring qf contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to its customers  including exercising its options if applicable to extend these qf contracts at pre determined rates 
accordingly  og e will continue to explore opportunities to build or buy power plants in order to serve its native load 
as a result of the high volatility of current natural gas prices and the increase in natural gas prices  og e will also assess the feasibility of constructing additional base load coal fired units 
enogex initiated a program in to improve its financial profile and performance 
since january   enogex has completed significant sales transactions which have generated net sales proceeds of approximately million  reduced debt by approximately million or percent  reduced its number of employees by approximately percent  reorganized its operations and restructured its senior management team 
in addition to focusing on growing its earnings  enogex managed its commodity price and earnings volatility exposures and minimized its exposure to keep whole processing arrangements 
enogex s profitability increased significantly in and due to the performance improvement plan initiated in as well as an overall favorable business environment coupled with higher commodity prices 
while the company believes substantial progress has been achieved  additional opportunities remain 
enogex continues to review its work processes  evaluate the rationalization of assets  negotiate better terms for both new contracts and replacement contracts  manage costs and pursue opportunities for organic growth  all in an effort to further improve its cash flow and net income 
in addition  enogex is seeking to diversify its gathering  processing and transportation businesses principally by expanding into other geographic areas that are complementary with the company s strategic capabilities 
enogex s marketing business  which concentrates principally on origination of physical sales of natural gas  has expanded into the gulf coast  rocky mountain and east coast markets 
in addition to these ongoing efforts  in enogex began a major upgrade of its information systems that is expected to be substantially completed during the second and third quarters of enogex believes that these upgrades will be a major step towards obtaining the data required to allow it to capture available economic opportunities on its assets  provide improved customer service and enable management to better determine the earnings potential of its various assets and service offerings 
during  enogex made improvements to the stuart storage facility which reduced water encroachment in the field 
during  approximately million in capital expenditures was spent on this project 
enogex does not expect any material future expenditures on this water encroachment project

on october   the administrative law judge overseeing the proceeding recommended approximately million annual demand fee recovery with og e refunding to its customers any amounts collected in excess of this amount 
if this recommendation is ultimately accepted  og e believes its refund obligation would be approximately million at december   which the company does not believe is material in light of previously established reserves

compared to og e s operating income decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to the decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to o lower gross margins due to cooler weather in og e s service territory  o lower margins related to sales to wholesale customers  o the timing of fuel recoveries  and o higher operating expenses 
these decreases in operating income were partially offset by o growth in og e s service territory 
gross margin  which is operating revenues less cost of goods sold  was approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
the gross margin decreased primarily due to o cooler weather in og e s service territory which reduced the gross margin by approximately million  o lower margins related to sales to wholesale customers primarily resulting from reduced sales of power under a new wholesale contract with an existing customer which reduced the gross margin by approximately million  and o the timing of fuel recoveries which decreased the gross margin by approximately million 
these decreases in gross margin were partially offset by o growth in og e s service territory which increased the gross margin by approximately million 
cost of goods sold for og e consists of fuel used in electric generation and purchased power 
fuel expense was approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  an increase of approximately million or percent 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of fuel per kwh  primarily due to higher natural gas prices despite lower mwh sales 
og e s electric generating capability is fairly evenly divided between coal and natural gas and provides for flexibility to use either fuel to the best economic advantage for og e and its customers 
in  og e s fuel mix was percent coal and percent natural gas as compared to percent coal and percent natural gas in though og e has a higher installed capability of generation from natural gas units of percent  it has been more economical to generate electricity for our customers with lower priced coal 
purchased power costs were approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
the decrease was primarily due to og e s acquisition of the mcclain plant in july and the termination of power purchase contracts in december and august variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs  as compared to the fuel component included in the cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
while the regulatory mechanisms for recovering fuel costs differ in oklahoma  arkansas and the ferc  in each jurisdiction the costs are passed through to customers and are intended to provide neither an ultimate benefit nor detriment to og e 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays to enogex 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current proceedings at the occ regarding og e s gas transportation and storage contract with enogex 
other operating and maintenance expenses were approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  an increase of approximately million or percent 
the increase in other operating and maintenance expenses was primarily due to o increased outside services expense of approximately million  primarily due to higher expenses for infrastructure projects in the fourth quarter of  many of which were postponed from earlier in  o increased materials and supplies expense of approximately million  and o increased liability insurance expense of approximately million due to increased insurance premiums 
these increases in other operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by o lower salaries and wages expense of approximately million and lower pension and benefit expense of approximately million primarily due to more projects on which the costs are capitalized and are not being expensed currently 
depreciation expense was approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  an increase of approximately million or percent  primarily due to a higher level of depreciable plant 
also  another factor affecting results was an overall increase of approximately million in the reserves related to litigation 
compared to og e s operating income decreased approximately million or percent in as compared to the decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to o lower electric rates as a result of the million electric rate reduction that went into effect in oklahoma on january   o weaker weather related demand  o lower sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales  and o higher other operating and maintenance expenses 
these decreases in operating income were partially offset by o growth in og e s service territory 
gross margin was approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
the gross margin decreased primarily due to o lower electric rates as a result of the million electric rate reduction that went into effect in oklahoma on january   which reduced the gross margin by approximately million  o weaker weather related demand which reduced the gross margin by approximately million  and o lower off system sales which reduced the gross margin by approximately million as off system sales can vary based upon the supply and demand needs on og e s generation system and the market for off system sales 
these decreases in gross margin were partially offset by o growth in og e s service territory which increased the gross margin by approximately million 
fuel expense was approximately million in as compared to approximately million in  an increase of approximately million or percent 
the increase was due to a percent increase in the average cost of fuel per kwh  primarily due to higher natural gas prices and higher mwh sales 
og e s electric generating capability is fairly evenly divided between coal and natural gas and provides for flexibility to use either fuel to the best economic advantage for og e and its customers

mbp on november  the company is the sole participant in mbp in august  the company issued a million standby letter of credit to mbp for the benefit of insuring parts of the company s property and liability insurance programs 
in june  the standby letter of credit was increased to million 
mbp was established to provide million worth of property and liability insurance for the company 
the letter of credit was issued to provide protection for mbp in the event of large insurance claim losses 
at december   there were no drawings against this letter of credit 
because a letter of credit was issued  the total equity investment at risk of mbp was not deemed sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
therefore  mbp was considered a variable interest entity vie as defined in interpretation no 
and the company was the primary beneficiary which resulted in the consolidation of mbp into the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  effective january   the reinsurer of the mbp program agreed to remove the guarantee requirement which enabled the company to terminate the standby letter of credit previously provided 
however  the reinsurer added a ratings trigger requirement in the revised agreement such that if the commercial paper rating of the company is lowered by two grades  mbp may be surcharged an additional premium  which may result in an additional premium to the company 
because the guarantee requirement was removed  the total equity investment at risk of mbp was deemed sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
therefore  effective january   mbp was not considered a vie as defined in interpretation no 
which resulted in the deconsolidation of mbp during the first quarter of the company plans to terminate the mbp program during the first quarter of and does not expect the impact of terminating this program to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

accordingly  while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of unconditional fuel purchase obligations of og e noted above may increase capital requirements  such costs are recoverable through automatic fuel adjustment clauses and have little  if any  impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
og e currently has pending before the occ an application to recover the costs of gas transportation and storage services provided to it by enogex pursuant to the contract between og e and enogex 
an adverse decision by the occ could result in og e having to refund previously collected amounts

capital requirements and financing activities total capital requirements  consisting of capital expenditures  maturities and retirements of long term debt  interest payments on long term debt and pension funding obligations  were approximately million and contractual obligations  net of recoveries through automatic fuel adjustment clauses  were approximately million resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of approximately million in approximately million of the capital requirements were to comply with environmental regulations 
this compares to net capital requirements of approximately million and net contractual obligations of approximately million totaling approximately million in  of which approximately million was to comply with environmental regulations 
during  the company s sources of capital were internally generated funds from operating cash flows  short term borrowings through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper  issuance of long term debt  proceeds from the sale of assets and the issuance of common stock pursuant to the company s drip dspp 
the company uses its commercial paper to fund changes in working capital and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged 
changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of the company s business  the revenue lag between billing and collection for customers and fuel inventories

the company plans to refinance this amount and the company believes they have the ability to do so as the company and og e entered into new five year revolving credit agreements in october in an amount up to million which could be utilized to temporarily finance these notes when they mature in october interest rate swap agreements fair value hedges at december  and  the company had three outstanding interest rate swap agreements that qualified as fair value hedges i og e entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective march   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due october   to a variable rate based on the three month london interbank offering rate libor and ii enogex entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements  effective july  and october   to convert a total of million million for each interest rate swap agreement of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the six month libor in arrears 
the objective of these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standards 
these interest rate swaps qualified as fair value hedges under sfas no 
and met all of the requirements for a determination that there was no ineffective portion as allowed by the shortcut method under sfas no 
at december  and  the fair values pursuant to the interest rate swaps were approximately million and million  respectively  and the hedges were classified as deferred charges and other assets price risk management in the consolidated balance sheets 
a corresponding net increase of approximately million and million was reflected in long term debt at december  and  respectively  as these fair value hedges were effective at december  and cash flow hedges the company entered into four separate interest rate swap agreements  effective april   april   may  and july   respectively  to hedge approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  of future interest payments of long term debt that was issued in november these interest rate swap agreements originally matured on october  but the maturity date was extended to november  the company terminated these cash flow hedges on november   at which time approximately million was recorded in other comprehensive income

og e will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to these expiring qf contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to its customers  including exercising its options if applicable to extend these qf contracts at pre determined rates 
accordingly  og e will continue to explore opportunities to build or buy power plants in order to serve its native load 
as a result of the high volatility of current natural gas prices and the increase in natural gas prices  og e will also assess the feasibility of constructing additional base load coal fired units 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the new powersmith qf contract

approximately million of the company s capital expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
pension and postretirement benefit plans during  actual asset returns for the company s defined benefit pension plan were positively affected by growth in the equity markets  however  the growth in was not as strong as the growth in the equity markets in approximately percent of the pension plan assets are invested in listed common stocks with the balance invested in corporate debt and us government securities 
in  asset returns on the pension plan were approximately percent as compared to approximately percent in during the same time  corporate bond yields  which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations  have continued to decline 
contributions to the pension plan increased from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was necessitated by the lower investment returns on assets and lower discount rates used to value the accumulated pension benefit obligations 
during  the company plans to contribute approximately million to the pension plan 
the level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates 
higher returns on plan assets and increases in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the plan 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in the company made several changes to its pension plan  including the adoption of a cash balance benefit feature for employees hired after january  the cash balance plan may provide lower post employment pension benefits to employees  which could result in less pension expense being recorded 
over the near term  the company s cash requirements for the plan are not expected to be materially different than the requirements existing prior to the plan changes 
however  as the population of employees included in the cash balance plan feature increases  the company s cash requirements should decrease and will be much less sensitive to changes in discount rates 
during and  the company made contributions to the pension plan and the restoration of retirement income plan that exceeded amounts previously recognized as net periodic pension expense and recorded a net prepaid benefit obligation at december  and of approximately million and million  respectively 
at december  and  the company s projected pension benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets and the restoration of retirement income plan assets by approximately million and million  respectively 
as a result of recording a prepaid benefit obligation and having a funded status where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets  provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  required the recognition of an additional minimum liability in the amount of approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and the offset of this entry was an intangible asset and accumulated other comprehensive income  net of a deferred tax asset  therefore  this adjustment did not impact the results of operations in or and did not require a usage of cash and is therefore excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the amount recorded as an intangible asset equaled the unrecognized prior service cost with the remainder recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income represents a net periodic pension cost to be recognized in the consolidated statements of income in future periods

these agreements include two separate credit facilities  one for the company in an amount up to million and one for og e in an amount up to million 
each of the new credit facilities has a five year term with two options to extend the term for one year 
planned uses of the revolving credit include working capital needs  back up for the company s commercial paper program  the issuance of letters of credit and for general corporate purposes 
the company s and og e s ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a credit ratings downgrade 
their respective back up lines of credit contain rating grids that require annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if they suffer an adverse ratings impact 
the impact of any future downgrades would result in an increase in the cost of short term borrowings but would not result in any defaults or accelerations as a result of the rating changes 
unlike the company and enogex  og e must obtain regulatory approval from the ferc in order to borrow on a short term basis 
og e has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to million in short term borrowings at any one time 
in november  og e received approval from the ferc to incur up to million in short term borrowings for an additional two year period beginning january  through december  critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material affect on the company s consolidated financial statements particularly as they relate to pension expense and impairment estimates 
however  the company believes it has taken reasonable but conservative positions  where assumptions and estimates are used  in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates 
in management s opinion  the areas of the company where the most significant judgment is exercised is in the valuation of pension plan assumptions  impairment estimates  contingency reserves  accrued removal obligations  regulatory assets and liabilities  unbilled revenue for og e  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  the valuation of energy purchase and sale contracts and natural gas storage inventory and fair value and cash flow hedging policies 
the selection  application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
consolidated including electric utility and natural gas pipeline segments pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and the level of funding 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
the pension plan rate assumptions are shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumed return on plan assets is based on management s expectation of the long term return on the plan assets portfolio 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid 
the level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates 
higher returns on plan assets and increases in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the plan 
the following table indicates the sensitivity of the pension plans funded status to these variables 
change impact on funded status actual plan asset returns percent million discount rate percent million contributions million million expected long term return on plan assets percent none the company assesses potential impairments of assets or asset groups when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances require an analysis of the recoverability of an asset or asset group 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets shall be grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset or asset group shall include only the future cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
the fair value of these assets is based on third party evaluations  prices for similar assets  historical data and projected cash flow 
an impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the amount of any recognized impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the asset subject to impairment compared to the carrying amount of such asset 
enogex expects to continue to evaluate the strategic fit and financial performance of each of its assets in an effort to ensure a proper economic allocation of resources 
the magnitude and timing of any potential impairment or gain on the disposition of any assets have not been determined or included in the earnings guidance 
in the normal course of business  the company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims made by third parties  environmental actions or the action of various regulatory agencies 
management consults with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if in management s opinion  the company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
the scope of sfas no 
includes the company s accrued plant removal costs for generation  transmission  distribution  processing and pipeline assets 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made 
if a reasonable estimate of the fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred  the liability shall be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company assessed whether it had a legal obligation within the scope of sfas no 
the company determined that it had a legal obligation to remove certain assets associated with their retirements 
as the company currently has no plans to retire any of these assets except as discussed below and the remaining life is indeterminable  an asset retirement obligation was not recognized  however  the company will monitor these assets and record a liability when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made 
during the third quarter of  og e determined the definite life of a legal obligation within the scope of sfas no 
to retire certain assets related to the expiration of a power supply contract in june og e recorded an asset retirement obligation of approximately million at september  and began amortizing this amount for months beginning october  the company expects that the fasb will issue an interpretation related to sfas no 
during the first quarter of in which an entity would be required to recognize a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation that is conditional on a future event if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation would be recognized when incurred 
uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may be conditional on events occurring in the future would be factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the recognition of the liability 
however  in some cases  there is insufficient information to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
in these cases  the liability would be initially recognized in the period in which sufficient information is available for an entity to make a reasonable estimate of the liability s fair value 
the company expects that this interpretation will be effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  additionally  the interpretation is expected to permit  but not require  restatement of interim financial information during any period of adoption 
the fasb also has indicated that it will require both recognition of a cumulative change in accounting principle and disclosure of the liability on a pro forma basis for transition purposes 
the company will evaluate the financial impact when a final interpretation is issued 
og e and enogex engage in cash flow and fair value hedge transactions to manage commodity risk and modify the rate composition of the debt portfolio 
enogex may hedge its forward exposure to manage changes in commodity prices 
anticipated transactions are documented as cash flow hedges pursuant to sfas no 
hedging requirements and are executed based upon management established price targets 
during  oeri also utilized fair value hedges under sfas no 
to manage commodity price exposure for natural gas storage inventory 
however  during  oeri decided not to utilize hedge accounting under sfas no 
for natural gas storage inventory 
hedges are evaluated prior to execution with respect to the impact on the volatility of forecasted earnings and are evaluated at least quarterly after execution for the impact on earnings 
og e and enogex have entered into interest rate swap agreements on the debt portfolio to modify the interest rate exposure on fixed rate debt issues 
these interest rate swaps qualify as fair value hedges under sfas no 
the objective of these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standards 
electric utility segment og e  as a regulated utility  is subject to the accounting principles prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
provides that certain actual or anticipated costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets  based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates 
likewise  certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities  based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates 
management s expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment 
excluding recoverable take or pay gas charges  the mcclain plant operating and maintenance expenses  depreciation  ad valorem taxes and interest on debt  regulatory assets are being amortized and reflected in rates charged to customers over periods of up to years 
og e records certain actual or anticipated costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable  based on regulatory orders or other available evidence  that the cost or obligation will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates 
og e reads its customers meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month 
as a result  there is a significant amount of customers electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month 
unbilled revenue is presented in accrued unbilled revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period 
at december   if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent  this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of approximately million 
at december  and  accrued unbilled revenues were approximately million and million  respectively 
the estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers 
customer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the original due date 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate 
the provision rate is based on a month historical average of actual balances written off 
to the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections  there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized 
at december   if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by percent  this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of approximately million 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and is included in other operation and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
natural gas pipeline segment operating revenues for transportation  storage  gathering and processing services for enogex are estimated each month based on the prior month s activity  current commodity prices  historical seasonal fluctuations and any known adjustments 
the estimates are reversed in the following month and customers are billed on actual volumes and contracted prices 
gas sales are calculated on current month nominations and contracted prices 
operating revenues associated with the production of natural gas liquids are estimated based on current month estimated production and contracted prices 
these amounts are reversed in the following month and the customers are billed on actual production and contracted prices 
estimated operating revenues are reflected in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
estimates for gas purchases are based on sales volumes and contracted purchase prices 
estimated gas purchases are included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets and in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income 
oeri s activities include the marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the vast majority of these contracts expire within three years  which is when the cash aspect of the transactions will be realized 
a substantial portion of these contracts qualify as derivatives under sfas no 
and are marked to market with offsetting gains and losses recorded in earnings 
in nearly all cases  independent market prices are obtained and compared to the values used for this mark to market valuation  and an oversight group outside of the marketing organization monitors all modeling methodologies and assumptions 
the recorded value of the energy contracts may change significantly in the future as the market price for the commodity changes  but the value is still subject to the risk loss limitations provided under the company s risk policies 
the company utilizes a model to estimate the fair value of its energy contracts including derivatives that do not have an independent market price 
at december   unrealized mark to market gains were approximately million  which included approximately million of unrealized mark to market gains that were calculated utilizing models 
at december   a price movement of one percent for prices verified by independent parties would result in changes in unrealized mark to market gains of approximately million and a price movement of five percent on model based prices would result in changes in unrealized mark to market gains of approximately million 
energy contracts are presented in price risk management assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of accounting for energy contracts 
effective january   natural gas storage inventory used in oeri s business activities are accounted for at the lower of cost or market in accordance with the guidance in eitf which resulted in the rescission of eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  as amended 
prior to january   this inventory was accounted for on a fair value accounting basis utilizing a gas index that in management s opinion approximated the current market value of natural gas in that region as of the balance sheet date 
on april   natural gas storage inventory used in oeri s business activities began to be accounted for under sfas no 
in order to minimize risk  oeri enters into contracts or hedging instruments to hedge the fair value of this inventory 
for any contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 the hedged portion of the inventory is recorded at fair value with an offsetting gain or loss recorded currently in earnings 
during  oeri utilized hedge accounting under sfas no 
for natural gas storage inventory  however  during  oeri decided not to utilize hedge accounting under sfas no 
for natural gas storage inventory 
ineffectiveness associated with oeri s fair value hedge strategy was not material 
the fair value of the hedging instrument is also recorded on the books of oeri as a price risk management asset or liability with an offsetting gain or loss recorded in current earnings 
as part of its recurring business activity  oeri injects and withdraws natural gas under the terms of storage capacity contracts  the amount of natural gas inventory was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
natural gas storage inventory is presented in fuel inventories on the consolidated balance sheets and in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is calculated based on outstanding accounts receivable balances over days old 
in addition  other outstanding accounts receivable balances less than days old are reserved on a case by case basis when the company believes the required payment of specific amounts owed is unlikely to occur 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and is included in other operation and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for the natural gas pipeline segment was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the risk management process established by the company is designed to measure both quantitative and qualitative risks in its businesses 
a corporate risk management department  under the direction of a corporate risk oversight committee  has been established to review these risks on a regular basis 
the company is exposed to market risk in its normal course of business  including changes in certain commodity prices and interest rates 
the company also engages in price risk management activities for both trading and non trading purposes 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  the company enters into various derivative and other forward transactions pursuant to the company s policies on hedging practices 
these positions are monitored using techniques such as mark to market valuation  value at risk and sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations and commercial paper 
the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate debt to a certain percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the company utilizes interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues 
interest rate derivatives are used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
fair value hedges at december  and  the company had three outstanding interest rate swap agreements that qualified as fair value hedges i og e entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective march   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due october   to a variable rate based on the three month libor and ii enogex entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements  effective july  and october   to convert a total of million million for each interest rate swap agreement of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the six month libor in arrears 
the objective of these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standards 
these interest rate swaps qualified as fair value hedges under sfas no 
and met all of the requirements for a determination that there was no ineffective portion as allowed by the shortcut method under sfas no 
at december  and  the fair values pursuant to the interest rate swaps were approximately million and million  respectively  and the hedges were classified as deferred charges and other assets price risk management in the consolidated balance sheets 
a corresponding net increase of approximately million and million was reflected in long term debt at december  and  respectively  as these fair value hedges were effective at december  and cash flow hedges the company entered into four separate interest rate swap agreements  effective april   april   may  and july   respectively  to hedge approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  of future interest payments of long term debt that was issued in november these interest rate swap agreements originally matured on october  but the maturity date was extended to november  the company terminated these cash flow hedges on november   at which time approximately million was recorded in other comprehensive income 
this amount will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the related long term debt 
the fair value of the company s long term debt is based on quoted market prices and management s estimate of current rates available for similar issues with similar maturities 
the valuation of the company s interest rate swaps was determined primarily based on quoted market prices

commodity price risk the market risks inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments  positions and anticipated commodity transactions are the potential losses in value arising from adverse changes in the commodity prices to which the company is exposed 
these market risks can be classified as trading  which includes transactions that are entered into voluntarily to capture subsequent changes in commodity prices  or non trading  which includes the exposure some of the company s assets have to commodity prices 
the trading activities are conducted throughout the year subject to daily and monthly trading stop loss limits of million 
the daily loss exposure from trading activities is measured primarily using value at risk  subject to a million limit  as well as other quantitative risk measurement techniques 
these limits are designed to mitigate the possibility of trading activities having a material adverse effect on the company s operating income 
the prices of natural gas  natural gas liquids and natural gas liquids processing spreads are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
the changes in these prices have a direct effect on the operating income received by the company as compensation for operating some of its assets 
to partially reduce non trading commodity price risk incurred in the company s normal course of business caused by these market fluctuations  the company hedges  through the utilization of derivatives and other forward transactions  the effects these market fluctuations have on the operating income received by the company as compensation for operating these assets 
because the commodities covered by these hedges are substantially the same commodities that the company buys and sells in the physical market  no special studies other than monitoring the degree of correlation between the derivative and cash markets are deemed necessary 
sensitivity analyses have been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to the market risk of the company s natural gas and natural gas liquids commodity positions 
these analyses are done for both trading and non trading activities 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of natural gas inventories  commodity purchase and sales contracts  financial and commodity derivative instruments and anticipated natural gas processing spreads and fuel recoveries 
the value of trading positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted market prices 
because quoted market prices are not available for all of the company s non trading positions  the value of non trading positions is a summation of the forecasted values calculated for each commodity based upon internally generated forecast prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in such prices over the next months 
the results of these analyses  which may differ from actual results  are as follows for in millions trading non trading commodity market risk  net
