item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following analysis of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated footnotes included in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion and analysis presents a review of the company as of december  and its results of operations for the fiscal years ended december   and overview our principal business segments are based on product and include senior market health insurance  senior managed care medicare advantage  specialty health insurance  life insurance annuities and senior administrative services 
we also report the activities of our holding company in a separate segment 
previously  we reported our segments based on distribution channel 
our former senior market brokerage and career agency segments have been replaced with the three new segments senior market health insurance  life insurance annuity and specialty health insurance 
our senior managed care medicare advantage and senior administrative services segments will be unchanged 
we believe that this new segmentation will provide even greater clarity to our results 
reclassifications have been made to conform prior year amounts to the current year presentation 
a description of these segments follows senior market health insurance this segment consists primarily of our medicare supplement business and other senior market health products distributed through our career agency sales force and through our network of independent general agencies 
senior managed care medicare advantage our senior managed care medicare advantage segment includes the operations of heritage and our other initiatives in managed care for seniors 
heritage operates medicare advantage plans in houston and beaumont texas  and our medicare advantage private fee for service plan in the new york and pennsylvania 
specialty health insurance our specialty health insurance segment includes specialty health insurance products  primarily fixed benefit accident and sickness disability insurance  sold to the middle income self employed market in the united states and canada 
this segment also includes certain products that we no longer sell  such as long term care and major medical 
this segment s products are distributed primarily by our career agents 
life insurance annuities this segment includes all of the life insurance and annuity business sold in the united states 
this segment s products include senior  traditional and universal life insurance and fixed annuities and are distributed through both independent general agents and our career agency distribution systems 
senior administrative services our administrative services subsidiary  chcs services  acts as a third party administrator and service provider of senior market insurance products and geriatric care management for both affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies 
the services provided include policy underwriting and issuance  telephone and face to face verification  policyholder services  claims adjudication  case management  care assessment and referral to health care facilities 
corporate our corporate segment reflects the activities of our holding company  including debt service  certain senior executive compensation  and compliance with regulatory requirements resulting from our status as a public company 
intersegment revenues and expenses are reported on a gross basis in each of the operating segments but eliminated in the consolidated results 
these intersegment revenues and expenses affect the amounts reported on the individual financial statement line items  but are eliminated in consolidation and do not change income before taxes 
the significant items eliminated include intersegment revenue and expense relating to services performed by the senior administrative services segment for our other segments and interest on notes payable or receivable between the corporate segment and the other operating segments 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of assets and liabilities reported by us at the date of the financial statements and the revenues and expenses reported during the reporting period 
as additional information becomes available or actual amounts become determinable  the recorded estimates may be revised and reflected in operating results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounts that  in our judgment  are most critical to the preparation of our financial statements include policy liabilities and accruals  deferred policy acquisition costs  intangible assets  valuation of certain investments and deferred income taxes 
there have been no changes in our critical accounting policies during the current quarter 
policy related liabilities we calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders using the same actuarial assumptions that we use in the pricing of our products 
for our accident and health insurance business  we establish an active life reserve for expected future policy benefits  plus a liability for due and unpaid claims  claims in the course of settlement and incurred but not reported claims 
many factors can affect these reserves and liabilities  such as economic and social conditions  inflation  hospital and pharmaceutical costs  changes in doctrines of legal liability and extra contractual damage awards 
therefore  the reserves and liabilities we establish are based on extensive estimates  assumptions and prior years statistics 
when we acquire other insurance companies or blocks of insurance  our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to similar estimates and assumptions 
establishing reserves involves inherent uncertainties  and it is possible that actual claims could materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our net income depends significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in setting our reserves and pricing our policies 
if our assumptions with respect to future claims are incorrect  and our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses  we would be required to increase our liabilities resulting in reduced net income and shareholders equity 
deferred policy acquisition costs the cost of acquiring new business  principally non level commissions and agency production  underwriting  policy issuance  and associated costs  all of which vary with  and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business  are deferred 
for interest sensitive life and annuity products  these costs are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies arising principally from investment  mortality and expense margins in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
for other life and health products  these costs are amortized in proportion to premium revenue using the same assumptions used in estimating the liabilities for future policy benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
the determination of expected gross profits for interest sensitive products is an inherently uncertain process that relies on assumptions including projected interest rates  the persistency of the policies issued as well as anticipated benefits  commissions and expenses 
it is possible that the actual profits from the business may vary materially from the assumptions used in the determination and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs are written off to the extent that it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross profits would not be adequate to cover related losses and expenses 
present value of future profits and other intangibles business combinations accounted for as a purchase result in the allocation of the purchase consideration to the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  including the present value of future profits  establishing such fair values as the new accounting basis 
the present value of future profits is based on an estimate of the cash flows of the in force business acquired  discounted to reflect the present value of those cash flows 
the discount rate selected depends upon the general market conditions at the time of the acquisition and the inherent risk in the transaction 
purchase consideration in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired  including the present value of future profits and other identified intangibles  for a specific acquisition  is allocated to goodwill 
allocation of purchase price is performed in the period in which the purchase is consummated 
adjustments  if any  in subsequent periods relate to resolution of pre acquisition contingencies and refinements made to estimates of fair value in connection with the preliminary allocation 
amortization of present value of future profits is based upon the pattern of the projected cash flows of the in force business acquired  over weighted average lives ranging from six to forty years 
other identified intangibles are amortized over their estimated lives 
on a periodic basis  management reviews the unamortized balances of present value of future profits  goodwill and other identified intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets is not recoverable  in which case an impairment charge would be recognized 
management believes that no impairments of present value of future profits  goodwill or other identified intangibles existed as of december  investment valuation fair value of investments is based upon quoted market prices  where available  or on values obtained from independent pricing services 
for certain mortgage and asset backed securities  the determination of fair value is based primarily upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows of the security 
estimates of these cash flows are based upon current economic conditions  past credit loss experience and other circumstances 
we regularly evaluate the amortized cost of our investments compared to the fair value of those investments 
impairments of securities generally are recognized when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is considered to be other than temporary 
generally  we consider a decline in fair value to be other than temporary when the fair value of an individual security is below amortized cost for an extended period and we do not believe that recovery in fair value is probable 
impairment losses for certain mortgage and asset backed securities are recognized when an adverse change in the amount or timing of estimated cash flows occurs  unless the adverse change is solely a result of changes in estimated market interest rates and we intend to hold the security until maturity 
the cost basis for securities determined to be impaired are reduced to their fair value  with the excess of the cost basis over the fair value recognized as a realized investment loss 
income taxes we use the liability method to account for deferred income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of a change in tax rates 
we establish valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets for amounts that we determine will not be recoverable based upon our analysis of projected taxable income and our ability to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
increases in these valuation allowances are recognized as deferred tax expense 
subsequent determinations that portions of the valuation allowances are no longer necessary are reflected as deferred tax benefits 
to the extent that valuation allowances were established in conjunction with acquisitions  changes in those allowances are first applied to increasing or decreasing the goodwill but not below zero or other intangibles related to the acquisition and then applied as an increase or decrease in income tax expense

results of operations consolidated overview the following table reflects income from each of our segments and contains a reconciliation to reported net income for the year ended december  in thousands senior market health insurance    senior managed care medicare advantage  specialty health insurance    life insurance annuities    senior administrative services    corporate    realized gains losses    income before income taxes    income taxes  excluding capital gains    income taxes on capital gains losses   income tax benefit on early extinguishment of debt total income taxes    net income    per share data diluted net income we evaluate the results of operations of our segments based on income before realized gains and income taxes 
management believes that realized gains and losses are not indicative of overall operating trends

trust preferred securities all have scheduled maturities of years from the date of issue  however they are all callable by us after five years 
for the purpose of this schedule  we have assumed that the securities will be redeemed at their scheduled maturities  not the call date 
accordingly  the obligation for repayment of principal relating to these is included in the more than years column 
the trust preferred securities all have floating rate coupons  except for million which has a fixed rate through its no call period and then converts to a floating rate 
additionally  we have entered into separate swap agreements whereby we pay fixed rates on million of the trust preferred securities through the no call period 
we did not project future changes in the base interest rates 
for the purpose of this schedule  we applied the base rate in effect at december  to all future periods 
additionally  we assumed that  upon the expiration of the swap agreements and the fixed rate  the rate for the respective trust preferred securities adjusted to a variable rate using the current base rate 
includes scheduled amortization through final maturity in the loan payable is floating rate debt

our actual monthly payments are affected by the amount of service provided under the contract and the hmo product s premium levels in force and currently exceed the minimums stated in the contracts 
therefore our actual payments will exceed the amounts presented in the above schedule based upon future usage and premium amounts 
the obligations on policy related liabilities represent those payments we expect to make on death  disability and health insurance claims and policy surrenders 
these projected values contain assumptions for future policy persistency  mortality and morbidity comparable with our historical experience 
the distribution of payments for policy and contract claims includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amounts of those claims 
actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and policy and contract claims may differ significantly from the estimates above 
we anticipate that the liabilities for policyholder account balances and reserves for future policy benefits totaling billion  along with future net premiums  investment income and recoveries from our reinsurers  will be sufficient to fund future policy benefit payments

the outstanding balance on the debenture was million at december  we anticipate funding the repayment of the debenture from dividends of penncorp life canada 
we also require cash to pay the operating expenses necessary to function as a holding company applicable insurance department regulations require us to bear our own expenses  and to meet the costs of being a public company 
we believe that our current cash position  the availability of our million revolving credit facility  the expected cash flows of our administrative service company and management service organizations acquired in the acquisition of heritage and the surplus note interest payments from american exchange as explained below can support our parent company obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance as to our actual future cash flows or to the continued availability of dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries

our parent holding company paid million in interest on these debentures during  million in and million in the interest on these debentures is eliminated in consolidation 
dividends from penncorp life canada funded the interest and principal paid on the debenture to date and it is anticipated that they will fund all future payments made on this debenture 
sources of liquidity to the parent company we anticipate funding the obligations of the parent company and the capital required to grow our business from the four distinct and uncorrelated sources of cash flow within the organization as follows the expected cash flows of our senior administrative services company  the expected cash flows of our senior managed care company acquired in the acquisition of heritage  dividend payments received from penncorp life canada  and surplus note principal and interest payments from american exchange 
in addition  we maintain a large cash position and have access to our unutilized million revolving credit facility 
however  there can be no assurance as to our actual future cash flows or to the continued availability of dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries 
senior administrative services company 
liquidity for our senior administrative services subsidiary is measured by its ability to pay operating expenses and pay dividends to our parent company 
the primary source of liquidity is fees collected from clients 
we believe that the sources of cash for our senior administrative services company exceed scheduled uses of cash and results in amounts available to dividend to our parent holding company 
we measure the ability of the senior administrative services company to pay dividends based on its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
ebitda for our senior administrative services segment was million for the year ended december   and was million for and million for senior managed care company 
liquidity for our managed care company is measured by its ability to pay operating expenses and pay dividends to our parent company 
the primary source of liquidity is management fees for administration of selectcare and services provided to the ipa s 
dividend payments by selectcare to heritage are subject to the approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the state of texas  selectcare s state of domicile 
selectcare is not able to pay dividends during without prior approval 
we believe that the sources of cash to our managed care holding company exceed scheduled uses of cash which will result in funds available to dividend to our parent holding company 
we measure the ability of the senior managed care holding company to pay dividends based on its ebitda 
ebitda for our senior managed care holding company was million for the seven months since its acquisition on may  penncorp life canada dividends 
penncorp life canada is a canadian insurance company 
canadian law provides that a life insurer may pay a dividend after such dividend declaration has been approved by its board of directors and upon at least days prior notification to the superintendent of financial institutions 
such a dividend is limited to retained net income based on canadian gaap for the preceding two years  plus net income earned for the current year 
in considering approval of a dividend  the board of directors must consider whether the payment of such dividend would be in contravention of the insurance companies act of canada 
during the first quarter of  penncorp life canada paid dividends of c million approximately us million to universal american  relating to net income 
the amount of the dividend was larger than normal due to a benefit received by penncorp life canada from an actuarial experience study that allowed penncorp life canada to reduce its policy benefit reserves at december  on a canadian gaap basis 
the actuarial experience study did not have an impact on penncorp life canada s policy benefit reserves on a us gaap basis 
during the remainder of  penncorp life canada paid dividends totaling c million us million relating to net income for penncorp life canada paid dividends to universal american totaling c million us million during and c million us million during we anticipate that penncorp life canada will be able to pay dividends equal to its net income earned during  less million 
insurance subsidiaries surplus note  dividends and capital contributions 
cash generated by our insurance company subsidiaries will be made available to our holding company  principally through periodic payments of principal and interest on the surplus note owed to our holding company by our subsidiary  american exchange life 
as of december   the principal amount of the surplus note was million 
the note bears interest to our parent holding company at libor plus basis points 
we anticipate that the surplus note will be primarily serviced by dividends from pennsylvania life  a wholly owned subsidiary of american exchange  and by tax sharing payments among the insurance companies that are wholly owned by american exchange and file a consolidated federal income tax return 
american exchange made principal payments totaling million during the year ended december  no principal payments were made during during  the surplus note was reduced by million in the form of a capital contribution to american exchange by our holding company 
american exchange paid interest on the surplus note of million during the year ended december   million in  and million in our parent holding company made capital contributions to american exchange amounting to million during in march  pennsylvania life declared and paid a dividend in the amount of million to american exchange 
american exchange made capital contributions of million to union bankers  million to american pioneer and million to american progressive during the year ended december  during the year ended december   no dividends were declared or paid by the us insurance company subsidiaries to american exchange 
during  american exchange received capital contributions from its parent totaling million 
american exchange made capital contributions of million to pennsylvania life  primarily relating to the acquisition of pyramid life  million to american pioneer  million to american progressive and million to union bankers 
pennsylvania life contributed million to pyramid life in during  pennsylvania life paid dividends amounting to million to american exchange 
universal american contributed of the common stock of american pioneer and american progressive to american exchange during american exchange also received capital contributions from its parent totaling million during the year 
american exchange made capital contributions of million to american pioneer and million to american progressive during dividend payments by our us insurance companies to our holding company or to intermediate subsidiaries are limited by  or subject to the approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of each insurance company s state of domicile 
such dividend requirements and approval processes vary significantly from state to state 
pennsylvania life is able to pay ordinary dividends of up to million to american exchange during  without prior approval 
pyramid life is able to pay ordinary dividends of up to million to pennsylvania life its direct parent with prior notice to the kansas insurance department and marquette would be able to pay ordinary dividends of up to million to constitution its direct parent without the prior approval from the texas insurance department during american exchange  american pioneer  american progressive  constitution and union bankers had negative earned surplus at december  and are not be able to pay dividends in without special approval 
insurance subsidiaries liquidity liquidity for our insurance company subsidiaries is measured by their ability to pay scheduled contractual benefits  pay operating expenses  fund investment commitments  and pay dividends to their parent company 
the principal sources of cash for our insurance operations include scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments  premium payments  annuity deposits  and the sale or maturity of investments 
both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and we believe that these sources of cash for our insurance company subsidiaries exceed scheduled uses of cash 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including benefits under accident and health insurance policies  death benefits and interest sensitive policy surrenders and withdrawals 
our accident and health insurance policies generally provide for fixed benefit amounts and  in the case of medicare supplement policies  for supplemental payments to medicare provider rates 
some of these benefits are subject to medical cost inflation and we have the capability to file for premium rate increases to mitigate rising medical costs 
our health insurance business is widely dispersed in the united states and canada  which mitigates the risk of unexpected increases in claim payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature 
these accident and health polices are not interest sensitive and therefore are not subject to unexpected policyholder redemptions due to investment yield changes 
some of our life insurance and annuity policies are interest sensitive in nature 
the amount of surrenders and withdrawals is affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar products  general economic conditions and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
although the contractual terms of substantially all of our in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders the right to surrender the policies and annuities  we impose penalties for early surrenders 
as of december  we held reserves that exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of our net retained in force life insurance and annuities by million 
our insurance subsidiaries  in our view  have not experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity in recent years 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and withdrawals 
in addition to the potential impact on liquidity  unanticipated surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if we were required to sell investments at reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands 
we manage our asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of changing market rates 
we have segregated a portion of our investment portfolio in order to match liabilities that are sensitive to interest rate movements with fixed income securities containing similar characteristics to the related liabilities  most notably the expected duration and required interest spread 
we believe that this asset liability management process adequately covers the expected payment of benefits related to these liabilities 
as of december   our insurance company subsidiaries held cash and cash equivalents totaling million  as well as fixed maturity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values and fair values of billion 
the net yields on our cash and invested assets decreased to for the year ended december   from for and for a portion of these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account balances  which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their credited interest rates 
the credited interest rates of the interest sensitive policyholder account balances are determined by us based upon factors such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities 
our insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum amounts of statutory capital and surplus as required by regulatory authorities 
however  substantially more than the statutory minimum amounts are needed to meet statutory and administrative requirements of adequate capital and surplus to support the current level of our insurance subsidiaries operations 
each of our insurance subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus exceeds its respective minimum statutory requirement at levels we believe are sufficient to support their current levels of operation 
additionally  the national association of insurance commissioners naic imposes regulatory risk based capital rbc requirements on life insurance enterprises 
at december   all of our insurance subsidiaries maintained ratios of total adjusted capital to rbc in excess of the authorized control level 
the combined statutory capital and surplus  including asset valuation reserve  of our us insurance subsidiaries totaled million at december  and million at december  statutory net income for the year ended december  was million  which included after tax net realized gains of million  and for the year ended december  was million  which included after tax net realized losses of million 
the net statutory loss for the year ended december  was million  which included after tax net realized losses of million 
penncorp life canada reports to canadian regulatory authorities based upon canadian statutory accounting principles that vary in some respects from us statutory accounting principles 
penncorp life canada s net assets based upon canadian statutory accounting principles were c million us million as of december  and were c million us million as of december  net income based on canadian generally accepted accounting principles was c million us million for the year ended december   c million us million for and c million us million for penncorp life canada maintained a minimum continuing capital and surplus requirement ratio mccsr in excess of the minimum requirement at december  investments our investment policy is to balance the portfolio duration to achieve investment returns consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity adequate to meet payment of policy benefits and claims 
we invest in assets permitted under the insurance laws of the various states in which we operate 
such laws generally prescribe the nature  quality of and limitations on various types of investments that may be made 
we do not currently have investments in partnerships  special purpose entities  real estate  commodity contracts  or other derivative securities 
we currently engage the services of three investment advisors under the direction of the management of our insurance company subsidiaries and in accordance with guidelines adopted by the investment committees of their respective boards of directors

our current policy is not to invest in derivative programs or other hybrid securities  except for gnma s  fnma s and investment grade corporate collateralized mortgage obligations 
as of december   of our fixed maturity investments had investment grade ratings from standard poor s corporation or moody s investor service 
there were no non income producing fixed maturities as of december  during the year ended december   we did not write down the value of any fixed maturity securities 
we wrote down the value of certain fixed maturity securities  considered to have been subject to an other than temporary decline in value  by million during  and by million during primarily as a result of the impairment of our world com holdings 
in each case  these write downs represent our estimate of other than temporary declines in value and were included in net realized gains losses on investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   our insurance company subsidiaries held cash and cash equivalents totaling million  as well as fixed maturity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values and fair values of billion 
federal income taxation of the company we file a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes that includes all of the non life insurance company subsidiaries  including heritage 
american progressive was included in the consolidated return through march  and american pioneer was included through june  american exchange and its subsidiaries and penncorp life canada are not current included 
american exchange and its subsidiaries  including american progressive since april  and american pioneer since july   file a separate consolidated federal return 
penncorp life canada files a separate return with the canada revenue agency 
as of december  we exclusive of american exchange and its subsidiaries and penncorp life canada had net operating tax loss carryforwards of approximately million including million from heritage that expire in and and capital loss carryforwards of million that expire in as of december   we also had an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that can be carried forward indefinitely 
as a result of our acquisitions of chcs and heritage  use of most of our loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitations 
as of december   american exchange and its subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards  most of which relate to the companies acquired in and were incurred prior to their acquisition by us  of approximately million that expire between and at december   american exchange and its subsidiaries also had capital loss carryforwards of million that expire in as of december   american exchange and its subsidiaries also had an amt credit carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that can be carried forward indefinitely as a result of the change in the ownership of the companies acquired in  use of most of these loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitations 
at december  and  the company carried valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  with respect to its deferred tax assets 
the company establishes a valuation allowance based upon an analysis of projected taxable income and its ability to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
as a result of uncertainty regarding the ability to generate taxable capital gains  the company established a valuation allowance in the amount of million for its capital loss carryforwards during that was recorded as a deferred income tax expense 
additionally  the company released million relating to a portion of reserve amounts established for pre acquisition tax years of certain life insurance subsidiaries that were being examined by the internal revenue service 
at december   the valuation allowance for certain of the life tax operating loss carryforwards no longer was considered necessary 
the amount of the valuation allowance released during was million and was recorded as a deferred income tax benefit 
in  the company established a reserve for pre acquisition tax years of certain life insurance subsidiaries that were being examined by the internal revenue service 
as a result of the increased profitability of the administrative services segment  valuation allowances for certain of the non life tax loss carryforwards no longer were considered necessary as of december  the amount of the valuation allowance released during was million and was also recorded as a deferred income tax benefit 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the value of the recorded net deferred tax assets 
our us insurance company subsidiaries  other than peninsular life insurance company  are taxed as life insurance companies as provided in the internal revenue code 
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of amended the internal revenue code to require a portion of the expenses incurred in selling insurance products to be capitalized and amortized over a period of years  as opposed to an immediate deduction in the year incurred 
instead of measuring actual selling expenses  the amount capitalized for tax purposes is based on a percentage of premiums 
in general  the capitalized amounts are subject to amortization over a ten year period 
since this change only affects the timing of the deductions  it does not  assuming stability of rates  affect the provisions for taxes reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  by deferring deductions  the change has the effect of increasing our current tax expense and reducing statutory surplus 
there was no material increase in our current income tax provision for any of the three years in the period ended december  due to the existence of our insurance company subsidiaries net operating loss carryforwards 
the jobs creation tax act of contains a provision that places a two year moratorium on the imposition of tax on distributions from policyholder surplus accounts psa 
additionally  the ordering rules were changed to allow for the first dollar of any distribution to reduce the psa 
any distribution during and from an insurance company that has a psa will be treated as a distribution from its psa account 
however  the distribution will not be subject to federal income tax 
as of december   we had million of psa balances  and have accrued million in deferred tax liabilities corresponding to those balances 
the jobs creation tax act of provides the mechanism to eliminate this potential tax without the imposition of any tax payment 
however  the transactions required to trigger the elimination of the potential tax would require pre approval of the insurance departments of the respective companies 
there can be no assurance that we will receive such approvals 
effects of recently issued and pending accounting pronouncements there was no material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations as a result of our adoption of the recently issued accounting pronouncements 
we do not anticipate any material impact from the future adoption of the pending accounting pronouncements  other than the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas r requires all companies to recognize compensation costs for share based payments to employees based on the grant date fair value of the award for financial statements for reporting periods beginning after june  refer to consolidated financial statements note recent and pending accounting pronouncements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in general  market risk relates to changes in the value of financial instruments that arise from adverse movements in interest rates  equity prices and foreign exchange rates 
we are exposed principally to changes in interest rates that affect the market prices of our fixed income securities as well as the cost of our variable rate debt 
additionally  we are exposed to changes in the canadian dollar that affects the translation of the financial position and the results of operations of our canadian subsidiary from canadian dollars to us dollars 
investment interest rate sensitivity our profitability could be affected if we were required to liquidate fixed income securities during periods of rising and or volatile interest rates 
however  we attempt to mitigate our exposure to adverse interest rate movements through a combination of active portfolio management and by staggering the maturities of our fixed income investments to assure sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and to address reinvestment risk considerations 
our insurance liabilities generally arise over relatively long periods of time  which typically permits ample time to prepare for their settlement 
certain classes of mortgage backed securities are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that in periods of declining interest rates  individuals may refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of the lower rates then available 
we monitor and adjust our investment portfolio mix to mitigate this risk 
we regularly conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment as being reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
the magnitude of changes modeled in the accompanying analyses should not be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather  be treated as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results 
the sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk assumes an instantaneous shift in a parallel fashion across the yield curve  with scenarios of interest rates increasing and decreasing and basis points from their levels as of december   and with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a pre tax decrease in the market value of our fixed income investments of million and a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in million decrease 
similarly  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a pre tax increase in the market value of our fixed income investments of million and a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a million increase 
debt we pay interest on our term loan and a portion of our trust preferred securities based on the london inter bank offering rate libor for one  two or three months 
due to the variable interest rate  the company would be subject to higher interest costs if short term interest rates rise 
we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to adverse interest rate movements by fixing the rate on million of the trust preferred securities for a five year period through the contractual terms of the security at inception and an additional million through the use of interest rate swaps 
we regularly conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment as being reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
the magnitude of changes modeled in the accompanying analyses should not be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather  be treated as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results 
the sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk assumes scenarios increases or decreases in libor of and basis points from their levels as of december   and with all other variables held constant 
the following table summarizes the impact of changes in libor  based on the weighted average balance outstanding and the weighted average interest rates for the nine months ended december  effect of change in libor on pre tax income for the year ended december  weighted weighted average basis basis basis basis description of floating average balance point point point point rate debt interest rate outstanding decrease decrease increase increase in millions loan payable other long term debt total as noted above  we have fixed the interest rate on million of our million of total debt outstanding  leaving million of the debt exposed to rising interest rates 
as of december  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million in short duration floating rate investment securities 
we anticipate that the net investment income on this million will be positively impacted by rising interest rates and will mitigate the negative impact of rising interest rates on our debt 
currency exchange rate sensitivity portions of our operations are transacted using the canadian dollar as the functional currency 
as of and for the year ended december   approximately of our assets  of our revenues  excluding realized gains  and of our income before realized gains and taxes were derived from our canadian operations 
as of and for the year ended december   approximately of our assets  of our revenues  excluding realized gains  and of our income before realized gains and taxes were derived from our canadian operations 
accordingly  our earnings and shareholder s equity are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the canadian dollar 
although this risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that both the assets and liabilities for our foreign operations are denominated in canadian dollars  we are still subject to translation gains and losses 
we periodically conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in the foreign currency exchange rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment of what is reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar  as compared to the actual average exchange rate for the year ended december   would have resulted in a decrease in our income before realized gains and taxes of approximately million for the year ended december  and a decrease in our shareholders equity of approximately million at december  a weakening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would have resulted in an increase in our income before realized gains and taxes of approximately million for the year ended december  and an increase in shareholders equity of approximately million at december  our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential change in sales levels  local prices or any other variables 
the magnitude of changes reflected in the above analysis regarding interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates should  in no manner  be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results
