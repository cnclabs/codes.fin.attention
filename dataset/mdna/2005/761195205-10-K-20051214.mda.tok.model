item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in the third quarter of fiscal  we spun off our energy operation  atlas america  to our stockholders and focused on being a specialized asset manager in financial fund management  real estate and equipment finance 
as a result of that spin off we no longer consolidate atlas america s financial statements with ours and  as a result  our assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and revenues and expenses have been substantially reduced 
although the distribution itself was tax free to our stockholders  there may be some tax liability as a result of the deconsolidation arising from prior unrelated corporate transactions among atlas america and some of its subsidiaries 
we anticipate that all or portions of any liability arising from this transaction may be reimbursed to us by atlas america 
before the spin off  in fiscal we had taken initiatives to expand our specialized asset management businesses 
these initiatives have resulted in material growth in both revenues and assets under management for those operations 
our total assets under management increased from billion at september  to billion at september   a increase 
included in this amount at september  are billion of financial fund management assets that are being carried on warehouse facilities for which we have been engaged as the collateral manager by cdo issuers for cdo s not closed 
the growth was particularly accelerated by our sponsorship in march of rcc which  at september   had billion in assets  all of which we manage

the increase related to interest income on cdo investments 
o million from rcc management fees and equity compensation 
rcc was formed in march this amount resulted primarily from the following million in rcc management fees 
these fees are paid on a monthly basis  million in rcc equity compensation as a result of the formation of rcc  for which we were granted  shares of restricted common stock and options to purchase  common shares at an exercise price of per share 
we will not receive a comparable fee from rcc in fiscal o a  increase in interest income on loans resulting from the consolidation of an apidos cdo issuer in our financial statements while it accumulates assets through its warehouse facility  and o a  decrease in other revenue 
the decrease resulted primarily from the following a million decrease in net reimbursement fees in fiscal as compared to fiscal the fees accrued in fiscal were due to the anticipation of the completion of trapeza cdo v vi 
no such fees were accrued in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by  a  increase in consulting and advisory fees for fiscal as compared to fiscal  and a  increase in interest income on cdo investments 
costs and expenses of our financial fund management operations increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal we attribute the increases to the following o a million increase in general and administrative expenses 
the increase resulted primarily from the following a million increase in wages and benefits as a result of the addition of collateral management personnel to manage our expanding portfolio of trust preferred securities  asset backed securities  syndicated loans  mezzanine loans and b notes and private equity investments 
a  increase in financial software programs and publications as a result of the implementation of new asset management systems in response to our growing assets under management 
a  increase in other operating expenses  primarily from increased insurance costs  rent allocations and other general and administrative expenses related to the addition of personnel 
a  increase in professional fees  the above were partially offset by  of reimbursed expenses from our trapeza  ischus and apidos operations and  from rcc  for fiscal o a  increase in equity compensation expense 
the increase resulted from the amortization for fiscal related to the transfer of  restricted shares of rcc held by resource capital manager to members of its management  and o a  increase in expenses of consolidated partnerships 
the increase resulted primarily from  of professional services incurred   of travel costs associated with acquisition activities of our private limited partnerships and  of state  city and miscellaneous taxes 
the minority interest share of the operating results of the limited partners of our consolidated partnerships for fiscal is shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations as minority interest expense 
in addition  expenses totaling million have been specifically identified as relating to rcc start up costs in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from our financial fund management operations increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal reflected our equity earnings subsequent to the completion of offerings by six trapeza cdo issuers which we had co sponsored as of september  as compared to three trapeza cdo issuers which we had co sponsored as of september  our financial fund management expenses were million in fiscal these expenses represent costs associated with our sponsorship and management of investment partnerships in the trust preferred and abs areas 
these expenses include primarily salaries  benefits and legal and professional fees 
these expenses were partially offset by reimbursements of million from our investment partnerships in the fiscal year ended results of operations real estate in real estate  we manage two classes of assets o real estate loans  owned assets and ventures  known collectively as our legacy portfolio  and o real estate investment limited partnerships and tic programs 
september  in millions assets under management legacy portfolio real estate investment limited partnerships and tic programs during fiscal  and  our real estate operations were affected by three principal trends or events o we sought growth in our real estate business through the sponsorship of five real estate investment partnerships and two tic programs  o we continued our program of resolving the loans in our existing portfolio through repayments  sales  refinancings  restructurings and foreclosures  and o in fiscal  we adopted fin the principal effects of the first two factors have been to reduce the number of our real estate loans while increasing our interests in real property and  as a result of repayments  sales  refinancings and restructurings  increasing our cash flow from loan resolutions while limiting the growth of our portfolio of loans and property interests 
the principal effect of adopting fin has been to consolidate in our financial statements the assets and liabilities of a number of borrowers although not affecting our creditor debtor legal relationship with these borrowers and not causing these assets and obligations to become our legal assets or obligations 
we have sponsored five real estate investment limited partnerships including one in the offering stage and two tic programs as of september   we had sponsored three real estate investment limited partnerships as of september  including one which closed on december  in the twelve months ended september   we resolved loans with a book value of million  realizing million in net proceeds 
in addition  we refinanced the first mortgage on a property accounted for by us as a fin asset and received net proceeds of million 
the first mortgage on a real estate venture in which we have a interest was refinanced and we received net proceeds of million 
while the number of loans in the legacy portfolio decreased from fifteen at september  to twelve at september   we continue to accrue interest on the face value of the loans  therefore the balance of the remaining loans has increased 
in addition  two loans upon which we foreclosed during fiscal year remain in the legacy portfolio as owned assets 
as a result  the loans and real estate assets in our legacy portfolio  principally outstanding loan receivables  increased from million at september  to million at september  subsequent to september   we have continued to resolve our legacy real estate portfolio  some of which was classified as held for sale on our balance sheet at september  as follows o at november   we had resolved one such asset and received cash proceeds of approximately million 
the carrying value of that asset at september  was million  o in fiscal we agreed to sell another fin asset  subject to senior lender consent  which we believe is likely 
we anticipate that the closing will occur during our second fiscal quarter in fiscal the carrying value of this asset at september  was million and we expect to receive net cash proceeds from the sale of approximately million  o we have agreed to sell another fin asset with a carrying value of approximately million and expect to receive proceeds of million including a million note in our first fiscal quarter  o we have agreed to sell another fin asset with a carrying value of  for  in the second fiscal quarter  and o another asset is in sales negotiations 
it has a carrying value of million 
based upon the current status of these negotiations  we believe that we will obtain cash proceeds of approximately million  and that the sale will occur in our second fiscal quarter 
also subsequent to september   we acquired a multi family property for approximately million including million of first mortgage financing for use in our sponsored real estate programs 
one of the two assets that was resolved subsequent to september   was classified for accounting purposes as a fin asset at september  for the years ended september  and  its fin revenues were million and million  respectively  and its fin expenses including depreciation and interest were million and million  respectively 
the other four assets were classified as held for sale at september  and their results of operations are reported as discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended september   and the following table sets forth information relating to the revenues recognized and costs and expenses incurred in our real estate operations during the periods indicated in thousands years ended september  revenues fin revenues   property management  interest  accreted loan discount   gains on resolutions of loans  fin assets and ventures   fee income from sponsorship of partnerships and tic programs   earnings losses of equity investees   rental  cost and expenses real estate general and administrative    fin operating expenses   year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from our real estate operations increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the increase to the following o a  increase in fin revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily related to a hotel property in savannah  georgia that we foreclosed on during fiscal  we included eleven months of operating income in our results for fiscal as compared to ten months for fiscal  o a million increase in fee and management revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal we earned fees for services provided to the real estate investment partnerships and tic programs which we sponsored relating to the purchase and third party financing of six properties in fiscal as compared to two properties in fiscal the transaction fees totaled million for fiscal and  for fiscal additionally  we earned management fees for the properties owned by real estate investment partnerships which we sponsored totaling million for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal  o a  increase in rental income for fiscal as compared to fiscal because of the sale of a real estate investment during the fourth quarter of fiscal offset by the foreclosure during fiscal on a hotel property in savannah  georgia whose results were included for three months of fiscal  and o a million increase in gains on resolutions of loans  fin assets and real estate assets 
a partnership in which we own a equity interest refinanced its mortgage 
we received net proceeds from the refinancing of million which was million in excess of the recorded value of our interest 
we recognized the million as a gain 
in addition  during fiscal  we foreclosed on a loan that was classified as a fin asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with the foreclosure  we acquired a note payable for  that was recorded on our books as a fin liability in the amount of million  as a result  we recognized a gain of million 
the foreclosed asset is recorded as an investment in real estate at september  we recognized an additional gain of  in connection with the final resolution of an asset that was originally resolved during fiscal year we recognized an aggregate gain of  on the sale of two investments in our real estate investment partnerships during fiscal year in fiscal  we resolved five loans having an aggregate book value of million for million  recognizing a net gain of  we also received million for the sale of our investment in one venture resulting in a gain of  the increases were partially offset by the following o a million decrease in interest and accreted discount income resulting from the resolution of six loans since fiscal and the cessation of accretion on one loan as of july approximately million of the decrease related to one loan resolved during fiscal   of the decrease related to the cessation of accretion  and o a million decrease in our share of the operating results of our unconsolidated real estate investments accounted for on the equity method for fiscal as compared to the fiscal the majority of the decrease was due to costs of approximately million associated with the refinance of the first mortgage on a property in which we have a interest 
another  of the decrease related to losses incurred through equity investments in our real estate investment partnerships made subsequent to fiscal the loss from an equity investment which was converted from a loan during fiscal contributed another  of the decrease 
we support our real estate investment partnerships by making long term limited partnership investments 
in addition  from time to time  we make bridge investments in the underlying properties to facilitate acquisitions for our real estate investment partnerships and tic programs 
we record losses on our equity method investments primarily as a result of depreciation and amortization expense recorded by the real estate investment partnerships 
as additional investors are admitted to the real estate investment partnerships  we transfer the bridge investment in the real estate investment partnership to new investors at our original cost and recognize a gain approximately equal to the previously recognized losses incurred 
gains on resolutions of loans  fin assets and other real estate assets if any and the amount of fees received if any vary from transaction to transaction 
there have been in past  and we expect that in the future  there will be significant period to period variations in our gains on resolutions and fee income 
moreover  gains on resolutions will likely decrease in the future as we complete the resolution of our legacy portfolio 
costs and expenses of our real estate operations were million for fiscal  an increase of million as compared to fiscal we attribute the increase to the following o an increase of million in real estate general and administrative expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the increase resulted primarily from the following a million increase in wages and benefits as a result of the addition of personnel in our real estate subsidiary to manage our existing portfolio of commercial loans and real estate and to expand our real estate operations through the sponsorship of real estate investment programs  a  increase in sales and marketing expenses reflecting the efforts of in house marketing personnel and external wholesale representatives to sell interests in our real estate investment programs  a  increase in both property management expenses related to real estate investment partnerships and  of travel costs due to the increased acquisition activity associated with managing our real estate investment programs  a  increase in outside services  primarily legal and consulting offset by a  decrease in office expenses  including office rent and leased equipment  and o a  increase in fin operating expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily related to a hotel property in savannah  georgia that we foreclosed on during the quarter ended june   we included eleven months of operating expense in our results for the twelve months ended june  as compared to ten months for the twelve months ended june  year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from our real estate operations increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the increase to the following o an increase of million in fin revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal we adopted fin on july  which resulted in our having to consolidate fourteen entities as of september  as a result of sales of our interests and our restructuring of certain of our interests  we consolidated seven entities under the provisions of fin as of september  operations for fiscal and all of fiscal reflect fin revenues and expenses  as appropriate  o an increase of million in our share of the operating results of our unconsolidated real estate investments accounted for on the equity method in fiscal as compared to fiscal the majority of the increase relates to one investment and resulted from a change made in the first quarter of fiscal in the allocation of net income between the partners as a result of our preferential cash distributions  and o an increase of  in rental and other income in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily the result of three additional months of rental income from one property 
the increases were partially offset by the following o a decrease in interest and accreted discount income of million resulting from the following the transfer of fourteen loans to fin accounting treatment as of july  of which seven loans still remained as of september   which decreased interest income by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  the resolution of twelve loans which decreased interest income by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  the completion of accretion of discount on one loan  which decreased interest income by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and a decrease in our average rate of accretion  resulting in a decrease in interest income of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  partially offset by the conversion of one fin consolidated entity to a loan which increased interest income by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this resulted from the partial resolution of the loan  such that we are no longer the primary beneficiary of the borrower

net cash provided by our financing activities from continuing operations increased by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase in our cash flows is principally reflective of the following o an increase of million in borrowings  net of repayments  primarily the million utilized under the financial fund management warehouse credit facility in fiscal to acquire loans held for investment 
fiscal net borrowings were reduced by significant repayments  including the million redemption of the remaining outstanding senior notes  and o the million repayment of one fin mortgage loan  o a million increase in investor contributions to our financial fund management entities  and o million additional proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
o these increases were  offset  in part  by o million of cash used to repurchase  of our shares as part of our fiscal stock repurchase program  o million increase in distributions paid to minority holders  and o  increase in dividends paid to our shareholders 
cash flows from discontinued operations 
net cash provided by discontinued operations decreased by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease of cash from discontinued operations principally reflects the million of net proceeds received in fiscal from the resolution of two investments and the operating results of seven real estate properties held for sale as compared to the resolution of six real estate investments and the operating results of real estate properties held for sale in fiscal generating million of proceeds 
this decrease of million was offset  in part  by million of cash generated from operations of atlas america in fiscal as compared to fiscal year ended september  compared to year ended september  we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  as compared to million at september  our ratio of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interest and interest expense to fixed charges was to in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to to in the fiscal year ended september our working capital at september  was million  an increase of million from million at september  this increase primarily resulted from the net proceeds from the atlas america public offering which was a substantial component of the million remitted to us as a dividend 
our ratio of debt to equity at september  was as compared to at september  the lower ratio for fiscal reflects the redemption of the million of senior notes

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation changed the method of determining whether certain entities  called variable interest entities or vies  should be included in our consolidated financial statements 
the analysis of whether an entity is a vie and a result  must be consolidated is based on an analysis of risks and rewards  not control  and represents a significant and complex modification of previous accounting principles 
under fin  a vie is an entity that has o equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or o equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations  or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
a vie must be consolidated by its primary beneficiary  which is the party involved with the vie that has exposure to a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns or both 
all other entities are evaluated for consolidation in accordance with sfas no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries 
fin  as modified by a revised interpretation in december fin r is applicable to vies created after january   and to vies in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
for vies in which an enterprise holds an interest that it acquired before february   fin is applicable for financial statements issued for the first period ending after december  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin  the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie are initially measured at their carrying amounts  as defined in fin  with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and the value at which the primary beneficiary carried its interest in the vie prior to the adoption of fin being recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  the fair value at the date of adoption may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests of the vie 
we have determined that it was not practicable to determine the carrying values of the vies as of the date of the qualifying event and accordingly  have used the fair values at the date of adoption  july  as encouraged by the pronouncement  we early adopted fin on july  consequently  certain entities relating to our real estate business were consolidated in our financial statements in fiscal as a result  the assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses of the consolidated vies are included in our financial statements 
the investments in real estate loans and accreted interest income thereon  which were our variable interests in the vies  have been removed from our financial statements 
the assets and liabilities of the vies that are now included in our consolidated financial statements are neither our assets nor our liabilities 
liabilities of the vie can only be satisfied from the vie s assets  not our assets  nor can we use the vie s assets to satisfy our obligations 
as of july   the date of adoption  the consolidation of fin entities resulted in the addition of million in assets and million in liabilities to our consolidated balance sheet and in a million after tax cumulative effect adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  because we classified certain of our fin assets as being held for sale  the operations of those assets were recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as income from discontinued operations 
capital requirements the amount of funds we must commit to investments in our financial fund management  real estate and equipment finance operations depends upon the level of funds raised through financial fund management  real estate and equipment finance programs 
we believe cash flows from operations  cash and other working capital and amounts available under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund our contribution to these programs 
however  the amount of funds we raise and the level of our investments will vary in the future depending on market conditions 
dividends in the years ended september   and  we paid cash dividends of million  million and million  respectively 
we have paid quarterly cash dividends since august additionally  in fiscal  we distributed our million shares of atlas america to our stockholders in the form of a tax free distribution of million 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  is at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on the various factors affecting our financial condition and other matters the board of directors deems relevant 
in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved a increase in the quarterly dividend to per common share 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following tables summarize our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at september  in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     secured credit facilities   capital lease obligations operating lease obligations    purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations     not included in the table above are estimated interest payments calculated at rates in effect at september   less than year million  years million  years million and after years   amount of commitment expiration per period less than after other commercial commitments total year years years years guarantees   standby replacement commitments    other commercial commitments      total commercial commitments      in august  we entered into warehouse and master participation agreement with an affiliate of credit suisse first boston llc csfb providing that csfb will fund the purchase of bank loans by an apidos cdo issuer during the warehouse period at libor plus an amount ranging from to in return for a participation interest in the interest earned on the loans 
in addition  the agreement provided for a guarantee by us to csfb of the first million of losses on the portfolio of bank loans 
this guarantee expires upon the closing of the cdo transaction  which is expected to be in december four real estate investment partnerships in which we have general partner interests have obtained senior lien financing with respect to the nine properties they acquired 
in addition  two tic investment programs which we have sponsored have obtained senior lien financing with respect to two acquired properties 
these senior liens are with recourse only to the properties securing them subject to certain standard exceptions  which we have guaranteed 
these guarantees expire as the related indebtedness is paid down over the next ten years 
in addition  property owners have obtained senior lien financing with respect to seven of our loans 
the senior liens are with recourse only to the properties securing them subject to certain standard exceptions  which we have guaranteed 
these guarantees expire as the related indebtedness is paid down over the next ten years 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and cost and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the provision for possible losses  deferred tax assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
accounts receivable  investments in real estate  equipment finance and financial fund management and allowance for possible losses through our business segments  we engage in credit extension  monitoring  and collection 
in financial fund management  in evaluating the carrying value of our investments and our allowance for possible losses  we consider the collectibility of scheduled payments of principal and interest  the creditworthiness of each obligor and the impact of secondary market prices 
at september   our credit evaluation indicated that we had no need for an allowance for possible losses 
in real estate  in evaluating the carrying value of our investments and our allowance for possible losses  we consider general and local economic conditions  neighborhood values  competitive overbuilding  casualty losses and other factors which may affect the value of our investments 
the value of our investments may also be affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations and liability under applicable environmental laws  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing 
income from a property will be reduced if a significant number of tenants are unable to pay rent or if available space cannot be rented on favorable terms 
we reduce our investment in real estate loans and property interests by an allowance for amounts that may become unrealizable in the future 
such allowance can be either specific to a particular loan or property or general to all loans or properties 
as of september  and  we had investments in real estate loans and real estate of million and million  net of an allowance for possible losses of  and  respectively 
we believe our allowance for possible losses is adequate at september  however  an adverse change in the facts and circumstances with regard to one of our larger loans or properties could cause us to experience a loss in excess of our allowance 
in equipment finance  in evaluating our allowance for possible losses  we consider our contractual delinquencies  economic conditions and trends  industry statistics  lease portfolio characteristics and management s prior experience with similar lease assets 
at september   our credit evaluation indicated that we had no need for an allowance for possible losses for our lease assets 
we believe that no allowance for possible losses needs or is required based on our experience and our analysis of the net realizable value of our receivables at september  loans held for investment we purchase participations in corporate leveraged loans and commercial real estate loans in the secondary market and through syndications of newly originated loans 
loans are held for investment  therefore  we initially record them at their purchase prices  and subsequently account for them based on their outstanding principal plus or minus unamortized premiums or discounts 
in certain instances  where the credit fundamentals underlying a particular loan have changed in such a manner that we expect the return on investment may decrease  we may sell a loan held for investment due to such adverse changes 
once the determination has been made by us that we will no longer will hold the loan for investment  we account for the loan at the lower of amortized cost or market value 
loan interest income recognition interest income on loans includes interest at stated rates adjusted for amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield method 
when we purchase a loan or pool of loans at a discount  we consider the provisions of aicpa statement of position accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer to evaluate whether all or a portion of the discount represents accretable yield 
if a loan with a premium or discount is prepaid  we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase to interest income 
revenue recognition investments in financial fund management entities contain the interests in unconsolidated collaterized debt obligations owned by partnerships that we control and as a result  the entities are consolidated 
we account for our interests in unconsolidated collateralized debt obligations in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  using the effective yield method 
allowance and provision for loan losses to estimate the allowance for loan losses  we first identify impaired loans 
loans are generally evaluated for impairment individually  but loans purchased on a pooled basis with relatively smaller balances and substantially similar characteristics may be evaluated collectively for impairment 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  management believes it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when a loan is impaired  the allowance for loan losses is increased by the amount of the excess of the amortized cost basis of the loan over its fair value 
fair value may be determined based on market price  if available  the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs  or the present value of estimated cash flows 
increases in the allowance for loan losses are recognized in the statements of operations as a provision for loan losses 
a charge off or write down of a loan is recorded  and the allowance for loan losses is reduced  when the loan or a portion thereof is considered uncollectible and of such little value that further pursuit of collection is not warranted 
an impaired loan may be left on accrual status during the period we are pursuing repayment of the loan  however  the loan is placed on non accrual status at such time as o management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming months  o the loan becomes days delinquent  o management determines the borrower is incapable of  or has ceased efforts toward  curing the cause of the impairment  or o the net realizable value of the loan s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value of such loan 
while on non accrual status  interest income is recognized only upon actual receipt 
as of september   we had not recorded an allowance for loan losses 
at september   all of our loans are current with respect to the scheduled payments of principal and interest 
in reviewing the portfolio of loans and the observable secondary market prices  we did not identify any loans that exhibit characteristics indicating that impairment has occurred 
stock based compensation in connection with the formation of rcc  we were granted  shares of restricted stock and options to purchase  shares of common stock of rcc 
subsequently  we granted  of the restricted stock we were granted to certain members of rcc s management 
a holder of the restricted shares has all of the rights of a stockholder of rcc  including the right to vote such shares and receive dividends 
we account for the restricted stock and stock options in accordance with eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the terms of the stock award agreement provide that the deferred compensation be amortized over a three year graded vesting period with the amortization expense reflected as equity compensation expense 
the unvested stock and options are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in fair value as performance under the agreement is completed 
any change in fair value is reflected in the equity compensation expense recognized in that quarter and in future quarters until the stock and options are fully vested 
trapeza investments in trapeza entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting because we  as a owner of the general partner of these entities  have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operating and financial decisions 
we account for our share of the equity earnings of the trapeza entities using a one quarter lag  as permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we own combined general and limited partner interests in these entities ranging from to 
financial fund management entities investments in financial fund management entities contain the interests in unconsolidated collateralized debt obligations owned by partnerships that we control and  as a result  that are consolidated on our financial statements 
we account for these interests in accordance with eitf and reflect the interest owned by third parties as a minority interest in financial fund management on our consolidated balance sheets 
we combined general and limited partner interests in these entities range from to 
the accounts of investments in other financial fund management entities sponsored by us have been consolidated onto our books 
we reflect the interest owned by third parties as a minority interest in financial fund management on our consolidated balance sheets 
our general partnership interests in each of these entities is approximately 
real estate we sponsored and manage five real estate investment partnerships which were organized to invest in multi family residential properties 
we currently receive acquisition fees equal to of the net purchase price of properties acquired and an additional fee for debt placement related to the properties acquired 
we recognize these fees upon acquiring the properties and obtaining the related financing 
we also receive a fee equal to of the gross operating revenues from the partnerships properties  payable monthly 
we recognize this fee as the partnerships revenues are earned 
we typically subcontract our property management obligations to third parties 
additionally  we receive an annual investment management fee from the partnerships equal to of the gross offering proceeds of the partnership for our services 
this investment management fee is recognized ratably over each annual period 
we also sponsored and manage two tic investments which were established to acquire multi family residential properties 
we receive acquisition fees equal to of the purchase price of the properties acquired  financing fees equal to of the debt related to property acquisition and a bridge equity fee 
in addition  we also receive a property management fee equal to of the gross operating revenues from the tic investments  payable monthly 
we recognize this fee as the tic investments revenues are earned 
furthermore  we receive an annual asset management fee from the tic investment equal to of the gross offering proceeds of the property in connection with its performance of its asset management responsibilities 
the asset management fee is recognized ratably over each annual period 
we accrete the difference between our cost basis in a real estate loan and the sum of projected cash flows from that loan into interest income over the estimated life of the loan using the interest method which recognizes a level interest rate over the life of the loan 
we review projected cash flows  which include amounts realizable from the underlying properties  on a regular basis 
changes to projected cash flows  which can be based upon updated property appraisals  changes to the property and changes to the real estate market in general  reduce or increase the amounts accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
we also use the cost recovery method for loans when appropriate under the circumstances 
equipment finance our lease transactions are generally classified as direct financing leases in accordance with sfas no 
and its amendments as distinguished from sales type or operating leases 
such leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
unearned lease income  which is recognized as revenue over the term of the lease by the effective interest method  represents the excess of the total future minimum lease payments plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value expected to be realized at the end of the lease term over the cost of the related equipment 
we generally discontinue the recognition of revenue for leases for which payments are more than days past due 
initial direct costs incurred in consummating a lease are capitalized as part of the investment in lease receivables and amortized over the lease term as a reduction in the yield 
leases not meeting any of the criteria for classification as direct financing leases are deemed to be operating leases 
rental income consists primarily of monthly periodic rentals due under the terms of the leases 
generally  during the lease terms of existing operating leases  we will not recover all of the undepreciated cost and related expenses of our rental equipment and  therefore  we must remarket the equipment in future years in order to obtain a return on our investment 
our policy is to review quarterly the expected economic life of our rental equipment in order to determine the recoverability of its undepreciated cost 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we write down our rental equipment to its estimated net realizable value when it is probable that its carrying amount exceeds such value and the excess can be reasonably estimated  gains are only recognized upon actual sale of our rental equipment 
we receive acquisition fees from our leasing partnerships and ml equal to a percentage of the cost of leased equipment acquired on behalf of these parties as compensation for expenses we incur in acquiring and leasing our equipment 
these fees are earned at the time of the sale of the related leased equipment to them 
we receive management fees for managing and servicing the leased assets acquired on behalf of our leasing partnerships and ml which we deem to be earned at the time we provide our management services 
we receive servicing fees ranging from to of gross rental payments received from certain parties and for others  we receive servicing fees that average of the managed portfolio balance 
in addition  we also receive fees as a reimbursement of our operating and administrative expenses incurred to manage our leasing partnerships 
recently issued financial accounting standards in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles 
it also requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
the statement will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the impact of sfas will depend on the nature and extent of any voluntary accounting changes and correction of errors after the effective date  but management does not currently expect sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas  share based payment  sfas r which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
our option grants to employees and directors  as well as any restricted stock awards represent share based payments 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
sfas r is effective for us beginning with its fiscal year commencing october  the adoption of sfas r is expected to result in an approximate million charge before income taxes on our financial statements in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the following discussion is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonable possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
general we are exposed to various market risks  principally fluctuating interest rates 
these risks can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows and financial position as if hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at september  we analyze only the potential impacts of hypothetical assumptions 
our analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
financial fund management at september   the amount outstanding on our secured warehouse facility with csfb was million with a weighted average interest rate of for the year then ended 
a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate on this facility would change our annual net income by approximately  based on an expected maturity in december real estate portfolio loans and related senior liens 
we believe that none of the four loans held in our portfolio as of september  is sensitive to changes in interest rates since o the loans are subject to forbearance or other agreements that require all of the operating cash flow from the properties underlying the loans  after debt service on senior lien interests  to be paid to us and thus are not currently being paid based on the stated interest rates of the loans  o the senior lien interests ahead of our interests are at fixed rates and are thus not subject to interest rate fluctuation that would affect payments to us  and o each loan has significant accrued and unpaid interest and other charges outstanding to which cash flow from the underlying property would be applied even if cash flow were to exceed the interest due  as originally underwritten 
fin loans 
three loans we treat as fin liabilities and currently included in long term debt  are at fixed interest rates and are thus not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
equipment finance at september   the amount outstanding on the million leaf financial credit facility with national city bank was million at a weighted average interest rate of while the amount outstanding on its million credit facility with commerce bank was  at a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rates on these facilities would change our annual net income by approximately
