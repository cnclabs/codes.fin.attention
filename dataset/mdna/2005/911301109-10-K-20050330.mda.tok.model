item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein 
overview we are a specialty finance company engaged primarily in non prime automobile finance  which includes the purchase  warehousing  securitization and servicing of non prime automobile installment sales contracts originated by independent and franchised dealers of used automobiles 
we provide financing to borrowers who typically have limited or impaired credit histories that restrict their ability to obtain loans through traditional sources 
we conduct our automobile finance business through our wholly owned subsidiary united auto credit corporation  or uacc 
since entering the non prime automobile finance business in  we have expanded to offices throughout the united states 
we generate revenues primarily from net interest income and ongoing servicing of non prime automobile installments sales contracts 
historically  we have also provided retail banking services through a wholly owned subsidiary  pan american bank  fsb  a federally chartered savings association  or the bank  and have conducted an insurance premium finance business 
however  we have caused the bank to exit its federal thrift charter and dissolve effective february   and have discontinued our insurance premium finance business 
as a result  beginning with the quarterly period ended september   our insurance premium finance business and certain of our banking operations are treated as discontinued operations 
retail and wholesale deposits of the bank have historically been the primary funding source for our automobile finance business 
however  as part of our plan to exit the bank s federal thrift charter  we shifted the funding source of our automobile finance business to the public capital markets through securitizations and warehouse facilities 
in addition  and as part of the bank s plan of voluntary dissolution  we completed the sale of all three branches of the bank during the third quarter of  and distributed all non cash assets and excess capital of the bank  including the automobile finance business  to us and pafi 
the bank exited the federal thrift charter because of the increasing regulatory requirements associated with financing our non prime automobile finance business mainly with insured deposits 
non prime lending has been and continues to be an area of lending which has been the subject of extraordinary regulatory concern and scrutiny among all of the federal banking regulatory authorities  including the office of thrift supervision  or ots  which supervised the bank 
this annual report includes restated financial statements for the years ended december  and and subsequent interim periods 
for a further description of this restatement see note restatements of consolidated financial statements to our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies  which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
certain accounting policies are described in detail in note summary of significant accounting policies to our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and we consider these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 

table of contents securitization transactions the transfer of our automobile contracts to the securitization trust is treated as a secured financing under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  also known as gaap 
for gaap purposes  the contracts are retained on the balance sheet with the securities issued to finance the contracts recorded as securitized notes payable 
we record interest income on the securitized contracts and interest expense on the notes issued through the securitization transactions 
as servicer of these contracts  we remit funds collected from the borrowers on behalf of the trustee to the trustee and direct the trustee how the funds should be invested until the distribution dates 
we have retained an interest in the securitized contracts  and have the ability to receive future cash flows as a result of that retained interest 
allowance for loan losses our loan loss allowances are monitored by management based on a variety of factors including an assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio  prior loss experience  the levels and trends of nonperforming loans  current and prospective economic conditions and other factors 
management also undertakes a review of various quantitative and qualitative analyses 
quantitative analyses include the review of charge off trends by loan type  analysis of cumulative losses and evaluation of credit loss experienced by credit tier and geographic location 
other quantitative analyses include the concentration of any credit tier  the level of non performance and the percentage of delinquency 
qualitative analysis includes trends in charge offs over various time periods and at various statistical midpoints and high points  the severity of depreciated values of repossession and trends in the economy generally or in specific geographic locations 
historically  we have accounted for the purchase of automobile contracts by recording the automobile contract at face value  and allocating the purchase discount to the allowance for credit losses and unearned income 
this method resulted in estimated expected credit losses over the life of the contract being provided at the date of purchase and the credit adjusted yield being recorded as interest income over the life of the automobile contract 
for all loans originated after december   we have established our allowance for loan losses by using the expected month charge off method which establishes allowances based on the incurred loss method that sums the expected charge offs for the next months in each static loss pool 
we account for such contracts by static pool  stratified into six month pools  so that the credit risk in each individual static pool can be evaluated independently  on a periodic basis  in order to estimate the future losses within each static pool 
additional provisions for credit losses for these pools purchased prior to were recognized immediately for pools where the remaining amount of the initial discount set aside was determined to be insufficient to cover losses expected to be incurred based on an analysis of projected losses during the entire life of the loans 
commencing january   we began to allocate the purchase price entirely to automobile contracts and unearned discount at the date of purchase 
the unearned discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the life of the contract 
an allowance for credit losses is now established through provisions for losses recorded in income as necessary to provide for estimated contract losses at each reporting date 
future results will reflect higher yields and provisions for credit losses being recorded from purchased automobile contracts 
despite these analyses  we recognize that establishing an allowance is an estimate  which is inherently uncertain and depends on the outcome of future events 
our operating results and financial conditions are sensitive to changes in our estimate for loan losses and the estimate s underlying assumptions 
our operating results and financial condition are immediately impacted as changes in estimates for calculating loan loss reserves immediately pass through our income statement as an additional provision expense 
management updates our loan loss estimates quarterly to reflect current charge offs 

table of contents derivatives and hedging activities the contracts originated and held by us are fixed rate and  accordingly  we have exposure to changes in interest rates 
to protect against potential changes in interest rates affecting interest payments on future securitization transactions  we entered into various agreements prior to closing our first securitization transaction 
in  we entered into forward agreements in order to reduce the risk of incurring larger interest payments on our notes payable on automobile secured financing 
the market value of these agreements is designed to respond inversely to changes in interest rates 
because of this inverse relationship  we can effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the transaction 
gains and losses on these agreements were recorded on our consolidated statements of operations  because the derivative transactions did not meet the accounting literature requirements to qualify for hedge accounting 
credit risk related to these instruments is minimal 
we are not currently engaged in any hedging activities 
results of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  as restated general in we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share for during the third quarter of  we shifted the funding source of our automobile finance business from retail and wholesale deposits of the bank to the public capital markets through securitizations and warehouse facilities 
the effect of this change in our funding source on our balance sheet has been a decline in deposit liabilities and a corresponding increase in securitized borrowings and warehouse liabilities 
interest income in increased to million compared with million in while net interest income increased to million in from million in gross automobile receivables were million at december  compared to million at december   accounting for much of the increase in interest income and net interest income 
interest income interest income  including discontinued operations  increased to million in from million in due primarily to a million increase in average interest earning assets and a basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on interest earning assets 
the largest components of growth in our average interest earning assets were automobile contracts  which increased million in  and investment securities  which increased million in the increase in automobile contracts principally resulted from the purchase of additional automobile contracts in existing and new markets consistent with the planned growth of this business unit 
the increase in the average yield on interest earning assets was principally due to a general increase in the market interest rates and the increase in the percentage of assets held in loans  which have higher yields compared to securities

non interest income non interest income increased million to million in from million in non interest expense non interest expense increased million to million in from million in this increase primarily reflects an increase in salaries  employee benefits and other personnel costs of approximately million associated with the expansion of our automobile finance operations 
in addition  occupancy expense increased  reflecting the costs associated with maintaining and expanding the branch offices in the automobile finance lending area 
during  we opened new branches for a total of branches at december  during we recognized a loss in market value of million on derivative instruments used to hedge our interest rate risk in our fixed rate loan portfolio 
for more information see critical accounting policies 
income taxes income taxes increased million to million in from million in this increase occurred primarily as a result of a million increase in taxable income from continuing operations before income taxes

additionally in  the bank began accreting the unearned discount on purchased contracts as an adjustment to yield over the life of the automobile contract 
interest income interest income  including discontinued operations  increased to million in from million in due primarily to a million increase in average interest earning assets  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest earning assets 
the largest components of growth in our average interest earning assets were automobile contracts  which increased million in and investment securities  which increased million in the increase in automobile contracts principally resulted from the purchase of additional automobile contracts in existing and new markets consistent with the planned growth of this business unit 
the increase in investment securities was primarily a result of the increase in assets required for the bank to meet the qtl test under federal regulations  requiring a specified level of qualified thrift investments 

table of contents the decline in the average yield on interest earning assets was principally due to a general decline in the market interest rates and to the increase in securities  which have lower yields compared to loans 
securities  with an average yield of  comprised of our average interest earning assets for securities  with an average yield of  comprised of our average interest earning assets for subsequent to filing amendment no 
on form k a for the fiscal year ended december   as part of our ongoing review and analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting for sarbanes oxley compliance  management discovered that  due to a programming error in the company s computer based accounting systems  the systems have failed to properly reverse accrued interest on certain charged off accounts since also  management has determined that the accretion of discount on purchased loans did not properly reflect the level yield method of reporting interest income and the methodology used to implement practice bulletin prior to january  was incorrect 
during those years  any expected credit loss over the life of a pool of loans in excess of the amount of discount on purchased loans was treated as an adjustment of interest income over the life of the loans  when it should properly have been charged to provision for loan losses 
consequently  this led to a decision to restate our financial statements for the years ended december   and and subsequent interim periods to correct the impact of unreversed accrued interest on these charged off accounts 
for a further description of this restatement see note restatements of consolidated financial statements to our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
interest expense interest expense  including discontinued operations  increased to million in from million in  due to a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest bearing liabilities 
the largest components of the increase in interest bearing liabilities were deposits of the bank  which increased to an average balance of million in from an average balance of million in  and borrowings under repurchase agreements  which increased to an average balance of million in from an average balance of million in the increase in borrowings under repurchase agreements resulted from the necessity to increase assets to comply with the qtl test of the ots 
the average cost of deposits decreased to in from in  generally as a result of a decrease in market interest rates and the repricing of deposits to these lower market rates

the negative provision expense in the insurance premium finance business occurred because our portfolio mix for insurance premium loans changed during and our portfolio experienced a decrease in higher loss consumer transactions and an increase in lower loss commercial transactions 
as a result  and have shown a substantial decrease in charge offs in the insurance premium finance business 
therefore  the allowance for loan losses for our insurance premium finance business required a negative provision expense 
the total allowance for loan losses was million as restated at december  compared with million as restated at december   representing of loans at december  and at december annualized net charge offs to average loans were for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses for was favorably impacted by the recovery of  from the state of california for refund of sales taxes on repossessed automobiles 
we applied for this refund of sales taxes based on a memorandum of opinion issued by the board of 
table of contents equalization of the state of california in wherein the state of california was required to refund sales taxes that had been paid on the loss portion of a repossessed automobile since january all amounts charged off on an automobile loan are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
thus  when we received a refund of sales taxes from the state of california  we returned the entire portion of that sales tax refund to the allowance account 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on our regular evaluation of loans held for investment and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes it has adequately provided for losses and does not expect any material loss on its loans in excess of allowances already recorded  no assurance can be given that economic or other market conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio

financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and december  as restated total assets decreased million  to  million at december  from  million at december  the decrease occurred primarily as a result of a million decrease in securities available for sale  which decreased to million at december  from  million at december  partially offset by a million increase in loans  which increased to million at december  from million at december  loans increased largely as a result of planned expansion in our automobile loan portfolio 
securities available for sale decreased as a result of our decision to decrease the amount of securities funded with repurchase agreements 
premises and equipment increased  to million at december  from million at december  primarily as a result of the continuing growth of our automobile finance business 

table of contents deposits decreased million  to million at december  from million at december  the deposit decrease is a result of our decision to exit the thrift charter and to fund our operations with commercial securitizations and warehouse borrowings 
securitization liabilities increased to million at december  from at december  due to the completion of our initial securitization of automobile contracts in the third quarter of as part of our plan to eliminate the reliance on insured deposits as our funding source 
warehouse liabilities increased to million at december  from at december  due to the implementation of our first warehouse borrowing facility in the third quarter of as part of our plan to eliminate the reliance on insured deposits as our funding source 
other interest bearing liabilities include borrowings under repurchase agreements 
borrowings under repurchase agreements were million as of december  as compared with  million as of december the decrease in borrowings under repurchase agreements was primarily due to our decision to decrease the amount of securities funded with repurchase agreements 
shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of our profit of million and a million increase from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits in  partially offset by a  reduction of unrealized gain on securities 
comparison of financial condition at december  as restated and december  as restated total assets increased million  to  million at december  from million at december  the increase occurred primarily as a result of a million increase in securities available for sale  which increased to  million at december  from million at december  and a million increase in loans  which increased to million at december  from million at december  loans increased largely as a result of planned expansion in our automobile loan portfolio 
securities available for sale increased as a result of the conversion of short term investments and the reinvestment of proceeds of increased borrowings under repurchase agreements 
the increase in the assets was required in order for us to meet the qtl test under federal regulatory regulations 
premises and equipment increased  to million at december  from million at december  primarily as a result of the continuing growth of our automobile finance business 
deposits increased million  to million at december  from million at december  retail deposits increased million  which increased to million at december  from million at december   including internet originated deposits 
other interest bearing liabilities include fhlb advances and borrowings under repurchase agreements 
fhlb advances for the purchase of securities are included as repurchase agreements 
borrowings under repurchase agreements were  million as of december compared with million as of december  the increase in borrowings under repurchase agreements was primarily due to our use of wholesale borrowings to fund the purchase of investment securities to meet the qtl test under federal regulatory requirements 
net deferred tax assets were million at december  due principally to temporary differences in the recognition of reserves for loan losses 
shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of our profit of million and a million increase from the exercise of stock options in  partially offset by a  reduction of unrealized gain on securities 

table of contents management of interest rate risk the principal objective of our interest rate risk management program is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our business activities  determine the level of appropriate risk given our operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with guidelines approved by our board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the exposure of our operations to changes in interest rates 
our board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis our asset liability position  including simulation of the effect on capital of various interest rate scenarios 
our profits depend  in part  on the difference  or spread  between the effective rate of interest received on the loans which we originate and the interest rates paid on deposits and other financing facilities  which can be adversely affected by movements in interest rates 
our interest rate sensitivity is monitored by the board of directors and management through the use of a model  which estimates the change in our net portfolio value  or npv  over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities  and npv ratio is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
we utilize a market value model based on the quarterly financial information 
the following table shows the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december   the most recent date for which the relevant npv model is available  assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of  and basis points 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value net portfolio value npv as of portfolio value of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands basis points   bp basis points  bp basis points  bp basis points  bp basis points  bp basis points  bp basis points  bp at december   the bank s sensitivity measure resulting from a basis point decrease in interest rates was basis points and would result in  increase in the npv of the bank  and from a basis point increase in interest rates was basis points and would result in a  decrease in the npv of the bank 
although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
management monitors the results of this modeling  which are presented to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the automobile contracts originated by us are fixed rate 
we expect to implement a new securitization each months  which are also fixed rate borrowings 
we have interest rate risk on our fixed rate loans while they are funded with warehouse borrowings because the warehouse borrowings are variable rate 
we limit this exposure through the use of frequent securitizations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general we require substantial cash and capital resources to operate our business 
historically  our primary source of funds has been insured deposits at the bank and commercial repurchase agreements  and  to a lesser extent  fhlb advances  interest payments on short term investments and proceeds from the maturation of securities 
however  during the third quarter we shifted the funding source of our automobile finance business primarily to warehouse credit lines and securitizations 
as of december   we still held a small portfolio of bank deposits 
however  following the cancellation of the bank s federal thrift charter effective february   we no longer rely on insured deposits of the bank or fhlb advances as a funding source 
our primary uses of cash include acquisition of automobile contracts  securitization costs  operating expenses  and interest expense 
the capital resources available to us include interest income on automobile contracts  servicing fees that we earn under the automobile securitizations  releases from the spread accounts relating to the securitization  automobile loan securitization proceeds  borrowings under our credit facilities  commercial repurchase agreements  and our securities portfolio 
management believes that the resources available to us will provide the needed capital to fund purchases of automobile contracts  investments in origination and servicing capabilities and ongoing operations 
securitizations we completed one securitization transaction in the third quarter of this transaction is structured as an on balance sheet transaction  recorded as secured financing 
regular contract securitizations are an integral part of our business plan for the future so we will increase our liquidity and reduce risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we developed a securitization program that involves selling interests in pools of our automobile contracts to investors through the public issuance of aaa aaa rated asset backed securities 
automobile securitizations are used by many financial institutions and are part of a multi billion dollar annual market for asset backed securities 
as part of this process  management considers the relative risks and returns prior to initiating a securitization 
these risks include  but are not limited to  interest rate fluctuations during the warehouse period  increased prepayments speeds and losses  loss of servicing rights and adverse economic conditions 
these factors are explained in further detail in the section business factors that may affect future results of operations 
the sale is structured as an on balance sheet transaction so the trust is included in our consolidated financial statements 
in our securitization we sold our automobile contracts to a newly formed owner trust  which issued notes 
the table below provides information about the outstanding trust assets and liabilities as of december  the sale is structured as an on balance sheet transaction so the trust is included in our consolidated financial statements 
december  in thousands total assets total liabilities 
table of contents the net proceeds of the securitization were used to fund the sale of the bank s deposit liabilities 
to improve the level of profitability from the sale of securitized automobile contracts  we arranged for credit enhancement to improve the credit rating on the asset backed securities issued 
this credit enhancement was in the form of a financial guaranty insurance policy insuring the payment of principal and interest due on the asset backed securities 
the policy was issued by ambac insurance corporation 
warehouse facility as of september  we were party to one warehouse facility of million  which we use to fund our automobile finance operations to purchase automobile contracts pending securitization 
under the terms of the facility  our indirect subsidiary  upfc funding corp  may obtain advances on a revolving basis by issuing notes to the participating lenders and pledging for each advance a portfolio of automobile receivables 
upfc funding corp 
purchases the automobile receivables from uacc and uacc services the automobile receivables  which are held by a custodian 
we have agreed to provide an absolute and unconditional and irrevocable guaranty of the full and punctual payment and performance  of all liabilities  agreements and other obligations of uacc under the warehouse facility 
this facility is used to fund the purchase of automobile contracts and will be used as ongoing credit until we can structure another securitization 
other sources of funds the collection of principal and interest from contracts originated and securitized and the release of cash from the securitization spread account is another source of significant funds for us 
pursuant to the securitization  we receive cash released from the trustee from the spread account on the securitization once the spread account reaches a predetermined funding level 
the amount released from the spread account represents the return of the initial deposits to such accounts as well as the release of the excess spread on the securitized contract 
for future securitizations  collections of principal and interest may be deposited into collection accounts established in connection with the securitization 
we may receive access to the amounts deposited into collection accounts and amounts held in the spread account for these securitizations 
we use the amounts received in our daily operations  although delinquency or charge off rates in a securitization that exceeds established triggers  will require that amounts being held in spread accounts increase 
deposits as of december   we had deposits remaining in the bank of million 
these deposits were under contract for sale at that date and were sold on february  the bank dissolved upon cancellation of its federal thrift charter as of february  accordingly  we will no longer have access to insured deposits to fund our operations

recent accounting developments in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we are required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities created after december  for variable interest in variable interest entities created before 
table of contents january  the interpretation is applied beginning january  for any variable interest entities that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the variable interest entity initially are measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the variable interest entity 
we have evaluated the impact of applying fin r to existing variable interest entities in which we have variable interests 
the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accounts issued statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  or sop this sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
it includes such loans acquired in purchase business combinations and applies to all nongovernmental entities  including not for profit organizations

this sop limits the yield that may be accreted accretable yield to the excess of the investor s estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected over the investor s initial investment in the loan 
this sop requires that the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected nonaccretable difference not be recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual  or valuation allowance 
this sop prohibits investors from displaying accretable yield and nonaccretable difference in the balance sheet 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of a loan s yield over its remaining life 
decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as impairment 
this sop prohibits carrying over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of this sop 
the prohibition of the valuation allowance carryover applies to the purchase of an individual loan  a pool of loans  a group of loans  and loans acquired in a purchase business combination
