overview we are a large scale  multinational owner and operator of atm networks with operations in the united states  the united kingdom and canada 
with our november acquisition of efunds corporation s atm business  we have the second largest off premises atm network in both the united states and the united kingdom  and the third largest off premises atm network in canada  managing approximately  atms in the united states   atms in canada and  atms in the united kingdom as of december  in addition  with approximately  self service merchant based photocopiers in the united states  the united kingdom and canada as of december   we believe we have the largest such photocopier network in the world 
primarily as a result of our growing atm business  our net sales increased from million in to million in with the acquisition of the efunds atm business in the fourth quarter of  we expect that our net sales will increase significantly again in since current senior management assumed leadership in june  we have focused on improving the profitability of our business 
as a result  operating losses of  in and million in have been reversed as we achieved operating income of million in and million in atm operations 
we entered the atm business in  believing it to be a natural extension of our background in providing photocopiers to consumers in retail environments 
in the five years since we entered the business we have expanded our atm networks to include  atms as of december  we have been able to grow our atm business by acquiring atms or atm networks  establishing new merchant relationships  expanding existing merchant relationships and displacing existing third party operators as their contracts expire 
as a result of the increasing size of our atm networks  improved transaction pricing  our institution of a redeployment program for underperforming machines and favorable exchange rate movements  our atm net sales increased from million in to million in and million in atm acquisitions 
we have actively pursued acquisitions of atm networks since the second half of we acquired a atm us network in february from a company that continues to serve as a distributor for us 
in june  we entered the canadian atm market through our acquisition of mighty cash  which had atms 
we added atms to our uk networks through our acquisition of inkas financial in march  and added atms to our uk networks by purchasing a portfolio of contracts in july in november  we acquired the atm business of efunds  including ownership and or management of approximately  atms in the united states and  atms in canada 
at the time we acquired the efunds atm business  we reported that it included approximately  atms based on information provided to us by efunds 
after the closing  we discovered that merchant contracts with respect to  of the atms reported on the original transfer of sites had expired and that these machines should not have been reported as active at the time of the closing of the acquisition 
we are currently exploring our remedies under the acquisition agreement in connection with the over reported atm number 
however  because monthly transaction levels at the active atms have exceeded our expectations  we believe that the additional revenues from these machines will offset the shortfall in the number of atms from a gross revenue standpoint 
in addition  we believe that we will be able to obtain significant cost reductions as compared to efunds historic costs 
we are currently evaluating additional acquisitions and expect to pursue growth opportunities as we identify attractive candidates 
we focus our acquisition program on targets in the united states  united kingdom and canada  but expect to pursue acquisitions in other countries as opportunities arise 
when we acquire atms  or a company owning and operating atms  we immediately move to integrate the operations into our existing network to increase efficiencies and decrease operating expenses  such as transaction processing and servicing costs 
if necessary  we also seek to gradually increase the withdrawal fees on the atms to levels we believe will maximize the profitability of the machines 

table of contents photocopier operations 
we entered the photocopier business in as a result of increased competition from specialty full service business centers  copy and print shops  photocopiers located at other convenient merchant locations and home photocopiers and printers  the average number of photocopies made per installed machine has declined from  in to  in and  in contributing to these declines was our decision in the fourth quarter of to work with our merchants to increase per copy charges  which was based on our determination that sales resulting from the increased prices  together with cost savings  would exceed sales lost through the decreased volumes we expected that the price increases would produce 
in addition  we started a program in to remove low volume photocopiers from service or redeploy them to higher traffic locations 
as a result  we reduced the number of photocopiers we had in service from  as of december  to  as of december  our photocopier net sales in were million  a decrease of million from million of photocopier net sales for in december  we entered into a long term agreement with eckerd brooks pharmacy to operate photocopiers in each of its  us locations  phased in over a nine month period 
this agreement builds upon the eckerd installations we previously had in place

in december  the last employee of strategic software solutions  our software development subsidiary  was terminated and we negotiated termination of strategic software solutions office lease and accrued a related penalty

atm sales 
atm sales were million for compared to million for the million increase in atm sales was due to a combination of a million increase in transaction based sales and a million increase in service sales  which were partially offset by a million decrease in sales of atm equipment 

table of contents the million increase in transaction based sales resulted from expansion of our atm network the average number of transacting atms in our network during increased by compared to the increase of  average atms reflects the acquisition of existing atm contracts between february and july and the acquisition of the efunds network of approximately  atms in november in addition to sales of new contracts by our sales force 
price increases as a result of price increases and the increase in the value of the british pound  the average transaction based sales generated per withdrawal transaction increased to for compared to for the same period in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the average number of withdrawals per unit 
average withdrawals per atm per month decreased by  to for compared to for the decrease in average monthly withdrawals per atm was caused by the atm contracts acquired from efunds in november which historically had lower transactions per unit than our then existing networks 
the former efunds atms averaged transactions in december the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar increased for compared to  resulting in a million increase in atm sales 
this increase was substantially offset by the exchange rate related increase in costs 
photocopier sales 
photocopier sales in were million  down million compared to the million decrease resulted primarily from declining photocopy volume continuing a trend  photocopy volume declined by for compared to  to million copies from million copies  due to a combination of a decline in installed photocopiers to an average of  in from an average of  in  as we continued a program of eliminating lower volume sites that were unprofitable  and a decline in the average number of photocopies made per unit per month to  in from  in due primarily to price increases  as well as competition from alternative media and photocopying services 
the declining volume was partially offset by price increases the average sales price per photocopy increased to in from in as a result of our working with merchants to implement price increases in most of our photocopier locations 
the average sales per installed unit per month increased by to in compared to in exchange rate benefit the value of the british pound and canadian dollar relative to the us dollar increased for compared to  resulting in a million increase in photocopier sales 
this increase was substantially offset by the exchange rate related increase in costs 
sales discounts sales discounts on a consolidated basis as a percentage of sales were in and in sales discounts in the atm business increased to of transaction based sales in from in the increased discounts were caused by an increase in the percentage of merchants who both own the atm and provide their own cash in their atms

photocopier cost of sales 
cost of sales in our photocopier business decreased by million  to million in from million in  due primarily to a decrease in photocopy volume 
the reduction in photocopy volume resulted in a decline in the cost of paper and other supplies of million  and a reduction in depreciation of million 
these savings were partially offset by exchange rate effects  as we reported approximately  more in photocopier cost of sales in than we would have reported had the exchange rates for the british pound and canadian dollar remained at the average for selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased by million to million in from million in specific increases included a million increase in amortization expense due to the inclusion in of amortization of intangible assets relating primarily to atm contracts acquired in a million increase in labor related expense 
this increase of was caused by an increase in administrative employees necessary to accommodate our expanding business  including integration of businesses acquired in an  increase in travel expense due to atm business acquisition and capital raising activities 
a million increase due to the increase in the value of the british pound and canadian dollar 
asset retirements during  we determined that it was unlikely that photocopiers with a net book value of  held in storage would be returned to service 
accordingly  we charged the net book value of this equipment to expense 
interest expense interest expense increased by  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to borrowings on our new credit facility in the fourth quarter of to finance the acquisition of the efunds atm business

loss from discontinued operations our software development segment  which is shown as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations  had losses of  in and  in software development sales have been insignificant since the substantial completion of a development contract with ncr corporation in the second quarter of the last employee of our software development segment was terminated in the fourth quarter of

as we describe below  this gain was substantially offset by a corresponding increase in related uk expenses 
atm sales 
our atm sales were million in compared to million in the million increase in atm sales is attributable to an million increase in transaction based sales  a  increase in service sales and a million increase in sales of atm equipment 
the million increase in transaction based sales is a result of an expansion of our atm network the average number of transacting atms in our network during increased by approximately compared to redeployment of atms under an asset management strategy of moving atms from lower to higher transaction volume sites  we redeployed atms in price increases due in part to increases in the withdrawal fee per transaction that we initiated in the second half of and continued into  the average transaction based sales generated per withdrawal transaction increased by approximately  to in from in exchange rate benefits 
the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar increased during  resulting in a million increase in our atm sales in as compared to this increase was substantially offset by the exchange rate related increase in costs 
photocopier sales 
photocopier sales in were million compared to million in the million decrease resulted primarily from declining photocopy volume photocopy volume for our photocopier business declined by in  to million photocopies from million photocopies in  due to a combination of a decline in installed photocopiers to an average of  in from  in  as we continued a program of eliminating lower volume sites that were either unprofitable or marginally profitable  and a decline in the average number of photocopies made per unit per month to  in from  in due to competition from alternative media and copying services 
our declining photocopy volume was partially offset by price increases our average sales price per photocopy increased to in from in as a result of our working with our merchants to implement price increases in most of our photocopier locations  resulting in an increase in sales per average installed unit to  in from  in exchange rate benefits our photocopier segment reported approximately  more in sales in than it would have reported had the exchange rate for the british pound remained at the average 
this increase was substantially offset by the exchange rate related increase in costs 
sales discounts sales discounts as a percentage of consolidated sales were in and in sales discounts in the atm business increased to of transaction based sales from in the increased discounts were caused by an 
table of contents increase in the percentage of our uk merchants who supply their own cash and thereby receive a higher share of the withdrawal fees 
sales discounts in the photocopier business decreased slightly in  to of sales from in this decrease was due to decreased photocopy volumes  which decreased the percentage of photocopier sales we were required to pay to merchants 
cost of sales cost of sales on a consolidated basis increased by million in  but decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in atm cost of sales 
cost of sales in our atm operations increased by million  to million in from million in  as a result of increased transaction volume as we discuss in sales above  increased sales of atms we sold atms in as compared to atms in  and exchange rate effects 
our atm segment reported approximately million more in cost of sales in than would have been reported had the us dollar exchange rate for the british pound remained at the average 
this increase was substantially offset by the exchange rate related increase in costs 
cost of sales from our atm operations excluding the sale of atm equipment and the related costs of sale declined to of sales from in this percentage decrease resulted from increases in the amount of sales per transaction in addition to a decrease in per transaction cost due primarily to our renegotiation of some of our processing contracts 
excluding the cost of atm equipment sold and related commissions  the cost of sales in our atm business decreased to per transaction in  compared to per transaction in photocopier cost of sales 
cost of sales in our photocopier business decreased by million in  due primarily to decreased photocopy volume the decrease in photocopy volume resulted in a decline in the cost of paper by  and a reduction in the cost of labor by  and a decrease of  in the cost of scrapped and obsolete materials in as compared to following substantial completion of our inventory management program in these decreases were partially offset by exchange rate effects  as we reported approximately  more in photocopier cost of sales in than we would have reported had the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound remained at the average 
we do not anticipate that expenses for scrapped and obsolete materials will be significant going forward since parts and supplies inventory levels were reduced worldwide in and as a result of our inventory management program 
on a per photocopy basis  our photocopier cost of sales increased  to in from in selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense decreased by million  to million in from million in this reduction in expense was due in substantial part to a reduction in labor cost 
at the beginning of the third quarter  we determined that we were overstaffed for current business demands and  in combination with a number of other cost saving measures such as eliminating overnight freight  renegotiating telephone provider contracts  bringing armored car administration in house and bringing atm maintenance in house  began a reduction in work force throughout our operations 
the reduction in us employees took place primarily in the second half of  the reduction in uk employees took place in the first quarter of due to the timing of this action as well as the cost of severance payments  we did not realize the full cost savings from these actions in the decrease in labor expense was partially offset by a  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in our uk subsidiaries as a result of the increased value of the british pound relative to the us dollar in as compared to 
table of contents asset retirements asset retirements totaled  in and million in in the fourth quarter of  we determined that certain of our mita analog photocopiers we held in storage would not likely be returned to service based upon our commitment to purchase more technologically advanced konica photocopiers during  year over year declines in photocopy volumes  and what we believed were limited opportunities for large scale photocopier expansion 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we charged million  representing the net book value of these photocopiers  to expense 
during we wrote off additional equipment with a net book value of  which primarily consisted of additional older photocopiers that had been taken out of service and were not likely to be returned to service 
interest expense interest expense declined to million in  from million in the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from a decrease in the principal amount of our interest bearing obligations and from the lower interest rates on our long term debt as a result of a new loan agreement with bank of america entered into in may the interest rate on our borrowings from bank of america decreased to as of december   compared to as of december  long term debt and capital leases aggregated million as of december   a decrease from the million balance at the end of other income  loss or expense other income was  in compared to million of other expense in the expense was primarily the result of recognition of a million legal liability recorded subsequent to reaching a litigation settlement referred to in note to our consolidated financial statements 
tax rate our effective tax rate for was  resulting in a provision for income taxes of million  compared to an effective rate of and an income tax benefit of million in the change in the effective tax rate for as compared to was due primarily to the increase of our uk profits as a percentage of our total profits 
since the corporate tax rate is lower in the united kingdom  as a larger percentage of our pre tax income is generated in our uk operations and is not repatriated to the united states  more of our income will be taxed at the lower tax rate 
discontinued operations our software development segment  which is shown as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations  had losses of  in and income of  in software development sales had been insignificant since the substantial completion of a development contract with ncr corporation in the second quarter of the last employee of our software development segment was terminated in the fourth quarter of net income our net income of million for reflects a million increase from our net loss of million 
after giving effect to series a preferred stock dividends of million in each period and a portion of undistributed income allocated to the preferred shareholders in  our net income available to common shareholders was million in  compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of million in the increase in net income is primarily attributable to a million increase in gross profit  a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expense  a million decrease in asset retirements  and a million net decrease in other expenses  offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of million and increased losses from discontinued operations of million 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general during  we received million in net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock and million from the exercise of stock options 
we paid off and replaced the existing term loan and lines of credit  replacing them with a new term loan of million and borrowing under domestic and alternative currency lines of credit totalling million 
we also generated million in cash flows from operating activities in as compared to million in the increase in cash flows from operating activities was due in part to increased profitability and use of tax loss carryforwards  minimizing cash payments for income taxes 
we used these cash flows for the following purposes to expand our business through acquisitions of atm networks totalling million  including acquisition of efunds atm business  to acquire a minority interest in a publicly traded uk atm company  to make million in equipment purchases  primarily atm equipment  to redeem a portion of our series a preferred stock for million  to pay preferred stock dividends of million  and to make payments of million on capital lease obligations 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of december   compared to million as of december   and a net working capital deficit of million at december  compared to net working capital of million as of december  accounts payable increased from million as of december  to million as of december  this increase reflects increased atm inventory purchasing in the uk  the acquisition of efunds accounts payable in november and increased residual payments due to customers of the former efunds estate 
the current portion of long term debt increased by million to million  representing the amount due in under the new million term loan 
accounts receivable increased million  reflecting the acquisition of efunds accounts receivable and the resulting expansion of the billed customer base 
inventories increased million  primarily reflecting increased year end purchases in the uk 
as we discussed in item  business governmental and industry regulations  we believe that the remaining cost of upgrading our atms to comply with new industry standards known as triple des and emv will be approximately million in the united states and approximately million in the united kingdom  based upon exchange rates as of february  we will capitalize these costs and depreciate them over the remaining life of each asset 
bank of america credit facility general 
in connection with the acquisition of efunds atm business on november   we  together with our uk subsidiary  trm atm limited  which we refer to as trm ltd  entered into a million syndicated loan facility underwritten and arranged by bank of america  n

the 
table of contents events which constitute an event of default under the credit agreement are also customary for loans of this size  including payment defaults  breaches of our representations and covenants  adverse judgments against us in excess of a specified amount and a change in control 
we were in compliance with the covenants under this facility as of december  us vault cash facility general 
in march  we established a facility for funding the cash which is placed in our atm equipment which we refer to as vault cash for our us atms 
we currently have access to million of vault cash under the facility 
the facility is based on the relationship between three primary companies 
these companies are trm inventory funding trust  or the trust 
the trust is a delaware business trust that was created pursuant to a deposit trust agreement between gss holdings  inc as depositor  wilmington trust company as owner trustee  and trm atm corporation as servicer 
the majority equity holder in the trust is autobahn funding company  llc  and the minority equity holder is gss holdings  inc neither we  trm atm corporation nor any of our other affiliates have any ownership interest in the trust 
trm atm corporation  or trm atm 
trm atm is one of our subsidiaries and acts as the servicer under the facility 
autobahn funding company  llc  or autobahn 
autobahn is an affiliate of dz bank ag  deutsche zentral genossenschaftsbank frankfurt am main  which is the lender under the facility 
autobahn is independent of us  trm atm and our other affiliates 
operation of the facility 
we obtain our vault cash under the facility pursuant to a loan and servicing agreement 
in accordance with that agreement  autobahn raises funds by issuing asset backed commercial paper 
autobahn then loans those funds to the trust at an interest rate equal to the interest rate borne by the commercial paper plus 
the loaned funds are then deposited into an account from which  at the direction of trm atm acting as the servicer of the facility  they are disbursed to an armored car carrier for transportation to our us atms 
the loaned funds are then available for withdrawal from the atms by the public 
the cash at all times remains the property of the trust  and the trust is ultimately obligated to repay autobahn 
the trust  as borrower under the facility  and trm atm  as servicer  use their cash from operations  which is principally derived from atm withdrawal and interchange fees  to fund a settlement account from which  in combination with its vault cash  trm atm directs repayment of the loans to the trust  the interest on the loans  a specified return on the equity investment made by the investors in the trust and the fees described below 
the trust engages trm atm  as servicer  and other agents and contractors from time to time to perform all duties assigned under the loan and servicing agreement 
under the terms of the november amendment to the facility  trm atm is permitted to subservice certain servicing functions to efunds pursuant to a master services agreement 
for a more complete description of the master services agreement and the acquisition of the efunds atm business  see business acquisition of the efunds atm business 
the loan and servicing agreement contains covenants applicable to us  including a minimum tangible net worth requirement 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  collateral and credit enhancement 
the trust s borrowings from autobahn are collateralized by the assets of the trust  principally the vault cash 
in addition  where the vault cash is placed in an atm  the trust has a security interest in all of the fees and charges earned or received with respect to that atm until those fees are distributed to trm atm 
autobahn is a party to a liquidity purchase agreement with other lenders  which ensures that the trust continues to have funds available for the term of the agreement and that autobahn will have the funds necessary to repay the commercial paper it issues 
each lender party to the agreement is required to have a credit rating at least as high as the credit rating of the commercial paper that autobahn issues 

table of contents cost of the facility 
the primary costs paid in connection with the facility are interest on the loaned funds 
the loans bear interest at an interest rate equal to plus the interest rate borne by the commercial paper that was issued to raise the funds for the loans 
return for equity investors 
autobahn and gss holdings  inc  as equity investors in the trust  receive a return on the value of their investments  which were  and  respectively  as of december  autobahn s annual return is equal to plus the interest rate borne by the commercial paper that is outstanding 
gss holdings annual return is equal to 
fees 
autobahn receives a commitment fee and trm atm  as servicer  and the collateral agent each receive administrative fees in connection with the facility

we resumed payment in the third quarter of and made the regularly scheduled payments of these dividends thereafter 
during we paid all dividends that had previously accrued with respect to the series a preferred stock 
in march  the remaining series a preferred stock automatically converted into common stock 
discontinued and restructured operations in we discontinued certain operations of iatmglobal 
net  a subsidiary involved in software development for advanced atm functions 
these operations  which were eventually sold to ncr corporation  contributed million and  of our net losses in and  respectively 
we retained a division of iatmglobal

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  sales  costs and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to depreciation  intangible assets  inventories  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and to understanding the results of those operations 
our use of the units of production method of depreciation for our analog konica photocopiers requires us to estimate their useful life 
we have estimated that the useful life of these assets is an average of  photocopies per machine 
as of december   we carried our analog konica photocopiers on our books at a cost of million less accumulated depreciation of million 
if future losses on disposal or significant decreases in the annual photocopy volume of this class of photocopiers become evidence of a shorter useful life than our original estimate  we will change the depreciable life  resulting in additional depreciation charges on a prospective basis 
if the estimated total production volume of these photocopiers were increased by  or  photocopies  our consolidated depreciation expense for would have decreased by approximately  if the estimated total production volume were decreased the same amount  our consolidated depreciation expense would have increased by approximately  we amortize intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of million as of december   over estimated useful lives of five to ten years 
acquired contracts  with a gross carrying amount of million are being amortized over ten 
table of contents years  primarily on an accelerated basis intended to reflect the cash flow patterns and duration used in estimating the value of those contracts 
a reduction in the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets would result in additional amortization expense on a prospective basis 
additionally  all intangible assets  including goodwill of million  are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
in any period that we determine the carrying amount of our intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and fair value will be charged to expense 
we maintain reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory  such as signage  equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  we may need to decrease our estimate of the market value of our inventory and  as a result  increase our reserves 
we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe we will realize 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we will be required to reduce our deferred tax assets and charge the amount of the reduction to expense in the period in which we make the determination 
similarly  if we determine that we will realize deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  we would increase income in the period in which we make the determination

d  effect of participating convertible securities on the computation of basic earnings per share  and requires the use of the two class method for the computation of basic earnings per share for companies that have participating securities 
the two class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings

sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based payments using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and instead requires companies to recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the expense will be measured as the fair value of the award at its grant date based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest  and recorded over the applicable service period 
in the absence of an observable market price for a share based award  the fair value would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for our third quarter beginning july  and apply to all awards granted  modified or cancelled after that date  and to the portion of previously granted awards that have not vested by the adoption date 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a
