business strategy and global presence prologis business strategy has evolved over time in response to changes in the environment in which it operates 
throughout this evolution  prologis focus has continued to be on its customers needs 
prologis was formed in as an industrial distribution operating company in the united states with a primary objective of differentiating itself from its competition 
to do this  prologis needed to be able to meet a corporate customer s distribution space requirements on a national  regional and local basis while providing customers with consistent levels of service throughout the country 
as such  prologis initial business strategy involved the acquisition and development of industrial distribution properties across the united states and the building of a management team that would operate throughout the united states 
these operating properties represented one operating segment the property operations segment as prologis intent was  and continues to be  to hold certain investments on a long term basis while generating income from leasing the properties to customers 
as prologis customers needs expanded to markets outside the united states  so did prologis portfolio and its management team 
prologis expanded its operations to mexico in and to europe in  and now has operations in european countries 
in  prologis again expanded its operations  this time to asia with the initiation of operations in japan 
prologis opened a representative office in china in and  
table of contents in  acquired its first real estate assets in china 
further expansion in included prologis entry into singapore  with the acquisition of an operating property  and canada  with the acquisition of land for future development 
in  prologis expanded its business to include the corporate distribution facilities services cdfs business operating segment 
the cdfs business segment began utilizing prologis existing development capabilities  which had been primarily focused on the development of properties for direct  long term investment  to develop properties for sale to third parties 
as a reit  prologis must distribute rather than reinvest substantial amounts of its internally generated capital 
accordingly  the cdfs business segment s sales to third parties provided prologis with funds that it could use as an alternative to public capital debt and equity markets 
the ability to recycle funds in the cdfs business segment became a more integral part of prologis business strategy in early when the public equity markets became an increasingly costly method of raising capital 
as such  it was necessary for prologis to increase the volume of its cdfs business segment transactions so that it could self fund its development activities 
therefore  prologis shifted the focus of its cdfs business segment from developing and selling properties to third parties to developing properties that would be contributed to property funds property funds that would be formed by prologis with private equity capital sources  in which prologis would maintain an ownership position and that would each be managed by prologis 
and  to supplement the private equity investments in each property fund  the property funds were positioned to obtain secured debt financing by using their properties as security 
today  the property funds leverage ratios typically range from to 
as prologis property funds grew  prologis expanded its cdfs business segment activities to also include the acquisition of properties that would be rehabilitated and or repositioned within the cdfs business segment prior to contribution to a property fund 
prologis property fund strategy allows prologis to realize  for financial reporting purposes  a portion of the development profits from its cdfs business activities by contributing its stabilized development properties to property funds profits are recognized to the extent of third party investment in the property fund  provides diversified sources of private capital to prologis thereby allowing prologis to have less overall capital invested  allows prologis to earn fees for providing services to the property funds  allows prologis to maintain a long term ownership position in the properties  and allows prologis  as the manager of the property funds  to maintain the market presence and customer relationships that are the key drivers of the prologis operating system see prologis management prologis operating system 
prologis first property fund was formed in august primarily with operating properties from prologis property operations segment  however subsequent property funds formed by prologis have primarily included properties developed by prologis in the cdfs business segment 
prologis fifteen property funds have been formed in several ways illustrating the flexibility that this business strategy affords prologis five of prologis property funds  all in the united states  were formed with an initial amount of private capital that allowed the property fund to generally make one portfolio acquisition from prologis  prologis european properties fund  prologis japan properties fund and prologis north american properties fund v were all formed with partners who have provided capital commitments to acquire properties on a continuing basis after formation  prologis and affiliates of four investment funds formed five property funds with the objective of acquiring properties from an established reit in a business combination 
these property funds also acquired properties from prologis  and 
table of contents interests in two established property funds were acquired by prologis as part of a business combination 
as prologis business strategy has evolved  the primary driver in this evolution has been prologis focus on its customers global needs for distribution space 
after years in operation  that focus has enabled prologis to become a leading global provider of distribution space operating on three continents 
prologis operating segments prologis business is organized into two operating segments property operations and the cdfs business 
property operations investments the property operations segment represents the long term ownership  management and leasing of industrial distribution properties

prologis develops distribution properties in its other operating segment  the cdfs business segment  with the intent to contribute the properties to property funds or to sell the properties to third parties 
prologis also acquires properties in the cdfs business segment  with the intent to contribute them to a property fund  generally after rehabilitation and or repositioning activities have been completed 
these cdfs business properties  along with their operations  are included in the property operations segment after they are completed or acquired through the date they are contributed or sold 
the gains and losses realized from the contributions or sales of these properties are included in the cdfs business segment s income because they were developed or acquired in that segment

prologis earned termination and renegotiation fees of million related to leases in its directly owned properties in such fees in were million 
in certain leasing situations  prologis finds it advantageous to negotiate lease terminations with a customer  particularly when the customer is experiencing financial difficulties or when prologis believes that it can re lease the space at rates that  when combined with the termination fee  provide a total return to prologis in excess of that which was being earned under the original lease terms

competition in general  numerous other industrial distribution properties are located in close proximity to prologis properties 
the amount of rentable distribution space available in any market could have a material effect on prologis ability to rent space and on the rents that prologis can charge 
in addition  in many of prologis submarkets  institutional investors and owners and developers of industrial distribution properties including other reits compete for the acquisition  development and leasing of distribution space 
many of these entities have substantial resources and experience 
competition in acquiring existing distribution properties and land  both from institutional capital sources and from other reits  has been very strong over the past several years 
property management prologis business strategy includes a customer service focus that requires prologis to provide responsive  professional and effective property management services at the local level 
to enhance its management services  prologis has developed and implemented proprietary operating and training systems to achieve consistent levels of performance and professionalism in all markets and to enable its property management team members to give the proper level of attention to prologis customers throughout its network 
prologis manages substantially all of its directly owned operating properties and all of the operating properties owned by the property funds 
customers prologis has developed a customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and that represents a broad spectrum of international  national  regional and local distribution space users 
at december   prologis and the property funds had  customers occupying million square feet of distribution space 
including customers leasing space in properties owned by the property funds  the largest customer and the largest customers accounted for and  respectively  of the annualized collected base rents of prologis and the property funds at december  when the customers leasing space in the properties owned by the property funds are excluded  prologis largest customer and its largest customers accounted for and  respectively  of prologis annualized collected base rents at december

prologis employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
seasonal nature of the business the demand for industrial distribution space is not seasonal 
future plans the growth in prologis property operations segment in was primarily through prologis property fund portfolios  rather than in prologis direct investments 
prologis current business plan with respect to direct investments in the property operations segment allows for the expansion of its network of operating properties as necessary to i facilitate larger transactions completed by property funds  ii address the specific expansion needs of a customer  iii initiate or enhance its market presence in a specific country  market or submarket  or iv take advantage of opportunities where prologis believes it has the ability to achieve favorable returns 
prologis expects to continue to increase the assets held by its property funds 
prologis expects to achieve this growth through the property funds acquisition of properties that have been developed or acquired by prologis in the cdfs business segment  but also by the property funds direct acquisition of properties from third parties as was done in with the formation of five new property funds 
prologis expects that the fee income it earns from the property funds will increase in over the level as the sizes of the portfolios of operating properties in the property funds increase 
and  depending on capital availability  prologis could also form new property funds in prologis intends to fund its investment activities in the property operations segment in primarily with operating cash flow from this operating segment  its lines of credit and short term borrowing facilities and the proceeds from contributions and sales of properties properties that have been directly owned  long term investments in the property operations segment  as well as cdfs business segment properties that are included in the property operations segment on an interim basis prior to their contribution or sale

table of contents competition prologis believes it has differentiated itself from its competitors as it is the only owner of distribution properties and provider of services with significant global operations and holdings in many key global distribution markets that allow it to operate on a consistent basis in many global markets 
north america there are a number of other national  regional and local developers engaged in the industrial distribution property development markets where prologis conducts business 
prologis competes with these developers for land acquisition and development opportunities 
the disposition market in north america is very competitive and is driven by the supply of new developments  access to capital and interest rate levels 
a key component of prologis success in the cdfs business segment in north america will continue to be its ability to develop and timely lease properties that will generate profits when contributed or sold and its ability to continue to access private capital that allows for the continued acquisition of prologis properties by the property funds 
europe prologis competition in the cdfs business segment in europe generally comes from local and regional developers in its target markets as opposed to pan european real estate companies 
as in north america  the disposition market in europe is very competitive and is driven by the supply of new developments  access to capital and interest rate levels 
with respect to its development activities in europe  prologis believes that it has additional competitive advantages due to the strategic locations of its land positions owned or under control in europe and due to its personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement process 
asia prologis competition in the cdfs business segment in asia generally comes from local and regional developers as opposed to real estate companies operating in several countries  as does prologis 
prologis believes that it has additional competitive advantages over the local development companies in japan and china due to its global experience in the development of distribution properties  its relationships with key customers established by its local personnel and its global customer base 
customers prologis uses the customer relationships that it has developed through its property operations segment activities and the prologis operating system in marketing its cdfs business 
see property operations customers and prologis management 
in  approximately of the customers that leased distribution space in prologis cdfs business segment properties were repeat customers of prologis 
employees prologis directly employs approximately persons 
prologis employees work in north america approximately persons  in nine countries in europe approximately persons and in three countries in asia approximately persons 
of the total  approximately employees are assigned to the cdfs business segment 
prologis other employees may assist with cdfs business segment activities 
prologis believes that its relationships with its employees are good 
prologis employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
seasonal nature of the business the demand for industrial distribution properties that are developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment is not seasonal in nature 
however  the development process can be impeded by weather in certain markets  particularly during the winter months  affecting the scheduling of development activities and potentially delaying construction starts and completions 
future plans prologis intends to continue to conduct the business of the cdfs business segment as it has in the past 
to be successful in the cdfs business segment  prologis must be able to i develop  acquire and rehabilitate or reposition and timely lease properties and ii access private capital through third party 
table of contents transactions or that can be used by a property fund to acquire cdfs business properties 
with respect to the first requirement for success  prologis has demonstrated that it has the ability to develop and acquire properties that can be disposed of in this operating segment and generate profits 
the ability to lease its properties is dependent on the demand for industrial distribution space 
properties contributed to property funds must generally meet specified leasing criteria 
prologis experienced stronger leasing activity in than in and prologis expects some improvement in leasing for based on its expectations for economic conditions in it target markets 
prologis market research and customer feedback indicate that consolidation and reconfiguration of supply chains driven by the need for distribution space users to add efficiencies within their distribution networks will continue to favorably impact the demand for distribution properties and the distribution related services that prologis offers in the cdfs business segment in also  the limited supply of state of the art distribution space in europe and asia and prologis position of being a single source provider of distribution space could also provide opportunities within this operating segment 
prologis believes that it has differentiated itself from its competitors by providing high quality customer service which can partially mitigate the impact of declines in market leasing activities over time 
for the past two years  approximately of the customers that leased distribution space in prologis cdfs business segment properties were repeat customers of prologis 
prologis intends to utilize the capital generated through the contributions and sales of properties  the proceeds from public debt and equity offerings that take advantage of favorable market conditions and its short term borrowing facilities to fund its future cdfs business activities 
further  prologis intends to actively pursue other sources of committed capital to form new property funds that will acquire prologis cdfs business properties 
prologis is committed to offer to contribute all of its stabilized development properties available in specific markets in europe to prologis european properties fund through september and all of its stabilized development properties available in japan to prologis japan properties fund through june these property funds are committed to acquire such properties  subject to the property meeting certain specified criteria  including leasing criteria  and having available capital 
prologis believes that  while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds may be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments  each property fund does have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available during prologis north american properties fund v has the right of first offer to all of prologis stabilized development properties that prologis desires to sell in north america except those properties that are subject to an agreement with prologis california through the end of properties subject to the right of first offer must meet certain specified criteria  including leasing criteria 
while prologis north american properties fund v s majority owner is a listed property trust in australia that is able to raise capital in the public market  there can be no assurance that prologis north american properties fund v will have the available capital to acquire additional properties from prologis in or  if capital is available  that prologis north american properties fund v will want to use its capital to acquire properties from prologis 
should prologis north american properties fund v choose not to acquire  or not have sufficient capital available to acquire  a property that meets the specified criteria  its rights under the agreement will terminate 
there can be no assurance that if existing property funds do not continue to acquire the properties that prologis has available  that prologis will be able to secure other sources of private equity capital such that it can contribute or sell these properties in a timely manner and allow prologis to continue to generate profits from its development activities in a particular reporting period

common share distributions that exceed prologis current and accumulated earnings and profits calculated for tax purposes constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend and generally reduce the shareholders basis in the common shares 
to the extent that a distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the shareholder s basis in the common shares  it will generally be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that shareholder s common shares 
at the beginning of each year  prologis notifies its shareholders of the taxability of the common share distributions paid during the preceding year 
the following table summarizes the taxability of common share distributions for the periods indicated in us dollars  taxability for is estimated years ended december  per common share ordinary income capital gains return of capital total in addition to common shares  prologis has issued cumulative redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest preferred shares

prologis tax return for the year ended december  has not been filed 
the taxability information presented for prologis distributions and dividends paid in is based upon the best available data 
prologis tax returns for previous tax years have not been examined by the internal revenue service

prologis earnings and profits are first allocated to the preferred shares  which increases the portion of the common share distribution that is characterized as return of capital 
the portion of the common share distribution that is characterized as return of capital represents the excess of distributions over the earnings and profits  and primarily results because non cash charges such as depreciation are not considered in determining distribution levels

funds from operations  as defined by prologis  is presented as a supplemental performance measure 
funds from operations is not used by prologis as  nor should it be considered to be  an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis ability to fund its cash needs 
funds from operations is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor does prologis intend it to present  a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance 
prologis believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that funds from operations is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings 
further  prologis believes that its consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 
the funds from operations measure presented by prologis will not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
at the same time that nareit created and defined its funds from operations concept for the reit industry  it also recognized that management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community 
prologis believes that financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders who review its operating results are best served by a defined funds from operations measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of funds from operations 
prologis funds from operations measure is discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funds from operations

prologis has increased its common share distribution level every year since its common shares became publicly traded in increased the total borrowing capacity under its lines of credit by billion yen approximately million at december   total borrowing capacity was in excess of billion at december  critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management 
generally  the judgment requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
of the accounting policies discussed in note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item  those presented below have been identified by prologis as critical accounting policies 
consolidation prologis consolidated financial statements include the accounts of prologis and all entities that prologis controls  either through ownership of a majority voting interest  as the primary beneficiary  or otherwise 
investments in entities in which prologis does not own a majority voting interest but over which prologis does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method 
investments in entities in which prologis does not own a majority voting interest and over which prologis does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  as appropriate 
management s judgments with respect to its level of influence or control of an entity and whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involve consideration of various factors including the form of prologis ownership interest  its representation on the entity s board of directors  the size of its investment including loans and prologis ability to participate in policy making decisions 
management s ability to correctly assess its influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in prologis consolidated financial statements and  consequently  its financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by its shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of prologis 
impairment of long lived assets prologis and its unconsolidated investees assess the carrying values of their respective long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable and  with respect to goodwill  at least annually applying a fair value based test 
the determination of the fair values of long lived assets  including goodwill  involves significant judgment 
this judgment is based on management s analysis and estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each long 
table of contents lived asset 
management s ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows impacts the determination of fair value 
if there is a decline in the fair value of a long lived asset combined with a history of the asset generating operating losses  prologis or its unconsolidated investees will be required to determine whether the operating losses associated with the asset will continue 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is primarily based on estimates of future operating results  the resulting cash flows and prologis intent to either hold or dispose of the long lived asset 
if an investment is considered impaired  a write down is recognized based on these analyses 
revenue recognition prologis recognizes gains and losses from the contributions and sales of real estate assets  generally at the time the title is transferred and prologis has no future involvement as a direct owner of the real estate asset contributed or sold 
in many of its transactions  an entity in which prologis has an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from prologis 
management makes judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that prologis can recognize given its continuing ownership interest and its level of future involvement with the investee that acquires the assets 
management s ability to accurately assess the provisions of each transaction under the accounting guidelines for profit recognition could impact prologis financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of prologis 
depreciation and useful lives of real estate assets prologis estimates the depreciable portion of its real estate assets and their related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense 
management s ability to accurately estimate the depreciable portions of its real estate assets and their useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying values of the underlying assets 
any change to the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized by prologis

rental income includes net termination and renegotiation fees of million in  million in and million in in certain leasing situations  prologis finds it advantageous to negotiate lease terminations with a customer  
table of contents particularly when the customer is experiencing financial difficulties or when prologis believes that it can re lease the space at rates that  when combined with the termination fee  provides a total return to prologis in excess of what was being earned under the original lease terms 
prologis cannot predict the level of such fees that will be earned in the future or whether prologis will be successful in re leasing  in a timely manner  the vacant space associated with the lease terminations 
rental expense recoveries from customers  a component of rental income  were million in  million in and million in rental income  excluding termination and renegotiation fees and rental expense recoveries and including discontinued operations  was million in  million in and  million in in  the average occupancy levels were higher than in in  the average occupancy levels were lower than levels  however  the increase in the number of properties in the directly owned portfolio in was sufficient to mitigate this effect 
the number and composition of operating properties that are directly owned by prologis throughout the periods presented impacts rental expenses for each period 
rental expenses  including discontinued operations were million in  million in and million in rental expenses are presented before any recoveries from customers  which are a component of rental income 
also  prologis reports the costs of managing the properties owned by property funds as part of rental expenses 
when a property is contributed to a property fund  prologis begins reporting its share of the earnings of the property under the equity method along with fee income earned for services provided to the property funds  and no longer reports the operations of the property as part of its rental income and rental expenses 
however  the overhead costs to provide the management services to the property fund continues to be reported as part of rental expenses 
rental expenses as a percentage of rental income  before rental expense recoveries and termination and renegotiation fees and including discontinued operations  were in  in and in total rental expense recoveries were  and of total rental expenses in  and  respectively 
these trends are the result of lower average occupancy levels that have been experienced over this three year period and due to the inclusion of the property management expenses associated with a higher number of managed properties in rental expenses 
lower occupancy levels will result in certain fixed costs being borne directly by prologis in instances where customers are not occupying the space to which the expenses relate 
additionally  prologis will absorb a higher percentage of common area costs when occupancy levels are lower because there are fewer customers available from whom these costs can be recovered 
the income from property funds includes fees earned by prologis for providing services to the property funds of million in  million in and million in as part of the keystone transaction see keystone transaction  prologis began earning fees from prologis north american properties funds vi through xii in these fees aggregated million 
prologis ownership interest in the property fund was the same for all periods presented and each of the property funds was in operation with substantially the same portfolio of properties for all periods presented 
prologis ownership interests are prologis california  prologis north american properties fund i  prologis north american properties fund ii  prologis north american properties fund iii and prologis north american properties fund iv 
with respect to each property fund  fluctuations between years in the amount that prologis recognizes under the equity method are generally due to occupancy levels and the amount of termination and renegotiation fees earned by the property fund 
additionally  fees earned by prologis for providing services to the property fund for other than property management and asset management services can fluctuate from year to year 
prologis share of the net earnings of prologis california for includes million of net gains from property dispositions 
prologis north american properties fund v has continued to acquire properties generally from prologis and increase its portfolio size since its inception on march  prologis ownership interest in prologis north american properties fund v was at december   at 
table of contents december  and at december  prologis earned fees other than for property management  asset management and leasing of million in  million in and million in excluding these fees  prologis recognized income from prologis north american properties fund v of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
these amounts correspond with the growth in the portfolio over the three years properties  million square feet at december   properties  million square feet at december   properties  million square feet at december  
prologis north american properties funds vi through x began operations on june  when prologis contributed properties aggregating million square feet to the five property funds

prologis has a ownership interest in each property fund 
see keystone transaction 
prologis north american properties funds xi and xii were formed by keystone 
prologis acquired keystone s ownership interest in each of these property funds as part of the keystone transaction 
these property funds own a combined properties aggregating million square feet see keystone transaction 
prologis european properties fund has continued to acquire properties  generally from prologis  and increase its portfolio size since it began operations in prologis ownership interest in prologis european properties fund was at december   at december  and at december  amounts presented for prologis european properties fund include prologis proportionate share of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
these amounts were net losses of million in  million in and million in excluding these net foreign currency exchange losses  prologis proportionate share of the net earnings of prologis european properties fund was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in the income recognized by prologis from its ownership in this property fund  excluding net foreign currency exchange losses  are the result of the following factors  i the size of the portfolio and occupancy levels in each period  ii increases in the fees earned by prologis for services provided to the property fund due to the increase in the number of properties managed by prologis  iii higher interest costs associated with the higher debt levels that primarily result from the use of debt to acquire the additional properties  iv decreases in prologis ownership interest in each year and v variances in the average foreign currency exchange rate at which prologis translates its share of the net earnings of the prologis european properties fund to us dollars 
prologis japan properties fund portfolio has grown to properties aggregating million square feet at december  from five properties aggregating million square feet at december  and from one million square foot property at december  prologis ownership interest in prologis japan properties fund has been since its inception on september  the increases in the amounts recognized by prologis under the equity method from its ownership in this property fund correspond with the growth in the portfolio over the three years 
the stabilized operating properties owned by prologis and the property funds were leased at december   leased at december  and leased at december  a property enters the stabilized pool at the earlier of months from acquisition or completion or when it becomes substantially leased  which is defined by prologis generally as 
therefore  prologis stabilized properties are generally those properties where the capital improvements  repositioning efforts  new management and new marketing programs for acquisitions or the marketing programs in the case of newly developed properties  have been completed and in effect for a sufficient period of time 
changes in economic conditions will generally impact customer leasing decisions and absorption of new distribution properties 
weakening economic conditions in the united states and certain western european countries and certain geopolitical concerns and uncertainties  primarily in europe  negatively impacted prologis stabilized occupancy levels in the last half of and in prologis observed improvements in north american absorption and occupancy levels beginning in the second quarter of at that same time  
table of contents prologis began to experience improvements in leasing activity in europe  primarily with respect to its existing pipeline of cdfs business assets that were included in the property operations segment prior to being contributed or sold 
with respect to japan  prologis has not observed similar negative trends in economic conditions and continues to experience consistent demand for distribution space in its properties 
prologis expects that the overall economic improvements experienced in will continue in prologis believes that the positive trends in occupancies in north america and europe will continue in however  prologis does not believe that occupancies will improve to the levels experienced in the to period  when occupancies were as high as 
prologis continues to believe that shifts in distribution patterns of its customers throughout the world and their needs to reduce their distribution costs have been  and will continue to be  key drivers of leasing decisions 
prologis believes that the diversification of its global operating platform and the prologis operating system have somewhat mitigated the effects of market occupancy decreases 
rental rates in for both new and renewed leases for previously leased space million square feet for all properties  including those owned by the property funds  decreased by as compared to a rental rate decrease of in and rental rate growth of in on similar transactions 
prologis believes that the negative rental rate growth experienced in continues to be the result of economic conditions that have depressed current market rents such that they are generally below the rents that prologis was earning on expiring leases 
prologis believes that this trend in rental rates will continue  although at a decreasing rate  through mid prologis management evaluates the operating performance of its property operations segment  its management personnel and individual markets using a same store analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period  thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures 
prologis includes properties owned directly and properties owned by its property funds in the same store analysis 
accordingly  prologis defines its same store portfolio of operating properties for each quarter as those properties that have been in operation throughout the full quarter in both the current year and the prior year 
when a property is disposed of to a third party it will be removed from the population for the current quarter and the corresponding quarter of the prior year only 
prologis same store portfolio ranged from million square feet to million square feet prologis adjusts its same store portfolio for dispositions on a quarterly basis 
net operating income generated by the same store portfolio  defined for the same store analysis as rental income  excluding termination and renegotiation fees  less rental expenses  increased by for from for  the net operating income of the same store portfolio applicable to that period increased by over the same store portfolio s rental rates decreased in by 
prologis believes that the factors that result in decreases in net operating income and decreases in rental rates in the same store portfolio are the same as for its total portfolio 
the percentage change presented is the weighted average of the measure computed separately for prologis and each of the property funds with the weighting based on each entity s proportionate share of the combined component on which the change is computed 
in order to derive an appropriate measure of period to period operating performance  the percentage change computation removes the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by computing each property s components in that property s functional currency 
rental income computed under gaap applicable to the properties included in the same store portfolio is adjusted to remove the net termination and renegotiation fees recognized in each period 
net termination and renegotiation fees excluded from rental income for the same store portfolio including properties directly owned and properties owned by the property funds were million for and million for net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease  offset by that customer s rent leveling asset that has been previously recognized under gaap  if any 
removing the net termination fees from the same store calculation of rental income allows prologis management to evaluate the growth or decline in each property s rental income without regard to items that are not indicative of the property s recurring operating performance 
customer terminations are negotiated under specific circumstances and are not subject to specific provisions or rights allowed under the lease agreements 

table of contents in computing the percentage change in rental expenses  the rental expenses applicable to the properties in the same store portfolio include property management expenses for prologis directly owned properties 
these expenses are based on the property management fee that is provided for in the individual agreements under which prologis wholly owned management company provides property management services to each property generally the fee is based on a percentage of revenues 
on consolidation  the management fee income earned by the management company and the management fee expense recognized by the properties are eliminated and the direct costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of prologis rental expenses reported under gaap 
cdfs business net operating income from prologis cdfs business segment consists primarily of i gains and losses resulting from the contributions and sales of developed properties and from the contributions of properties that were acquired with the intent to contribute the properties to a property fund  including properties that have been rehabilitated and or repositioned  ii gains and losses from the dispositions of land parcels  iii development management fees earned by prologis for services provided to third parties  and iv land holding costs and pursuit cost write offs associated with cdfs business assets 
income from the cdfs business segment is dependent on prologis ability to develop and timely lease properties  or to acquire properties that eventually can be contributed to property funds or sold to third parties  generating profits to prologis  and prologis success in raising private capital that can be used to acquire its properties  generally accomplished through the formation of property funds  but also from other sources 
for  prologis net operating income in this segment increased from by million an increase of million when the gains from dispositions of cdfs business properties that are presented as discontinued operations are included 
the net operating income in includes a net gain of million as a result of recognizing net contingent proceeds related to a contribution 
the increase in the gains recognized in from reflects higher gross margins  particularly associated with the transactions in the united kingdom and japan  a higher volume of transactions based on cost in  including more sales of land parcels in  and increases in the foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate gains recognized in europe and japan to us dollars in prologis attributes the volume of transactions in to improved leasing activity for cdfs business properties  mostly in europe  but also in asia  and also to its ability to raise private capital 
prologis believes that the increase in leasing activity results from improvements in economic conditions that have positively impacted its customers decision making processes with respect to changes in their distribution networks 
there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to maintain or increase the current level of net operating income in this segment 
prologis cannot predict the effects that economic conditions or other uncertainties  including geopolitical concerns  will have on its ability to lease its properties 
if prologis is unable to timely lease its completed developments and repositioned acquisitions  it will be unable to contribute these properties to property funds or otherwise dispose of the properties and would be unable to recognize profits from its cdfs business activities in the anticipated reporting period

when prologis contributes a property to a property fund in which it has an ownership interest  prologis does not recognize a portion of the proceeds in its computation of the gain resulting from the contribution 
the amount of the proceeds that cannot be recognized is determined based on prologis continuing ownership interest in the contributed property that arises due to prologis ownership interest in the property fund that acquires the property 
prologis defers this portion of the proceeds by recognizing a reduction to its investment in the respective property fund 
prologis adjusts its proportionate share of the earnings or loss that it recognizes under the equity method from the property fund in later periods to reflect the property fund s depreciation expense as if the depreciation expense was computed on prologis lower basis in the contributed property rather than on the property fund s basis in the contributed property 
if a loss results when a property is contributed to a property fund  the entire loss is recognized 
when a property that prologis originally contributed to a property fund is disposed of to a third party by the property fund  prologis recognizes the net amount of the proceeds that it had previously deferred in results of operations in the period that the disposition to the third party occurs

table of contents contractual obligations long term contractual obligations prologis had long term contractual obligations at december  related to long term debt senior unsecured notes  secured debt and assessment bonds  unfunded commitments on development projects  an unfunded commitment to a property fund and amounts due on revolving lines of credit as follows in millions of us dollars payments due by period less than to to more than total years years years years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations unfunded commitments on development projects unfunded commitment to a property fund short term borrowings amounts due on lines of credit interest on lines of credit and short term borrowings totals prologis had properties under development at december  with a total expected cost at completion of billion 
prologis has entered into contracts for certain phases of the construction of these projects 
however  these contracts do not generally cover all of the costs that are necessary to place the property into service  including the costs of tenant improvements and marketing and leasing costs 
the unfunded commitments presented include all such costs  not only those costs that prologis is obligated to fund under construction contracts 
at december   prologis was committed to make additional equity contributions to prologis european properties fund of million euro the currency equivalent of approximately million at december  through september  for purposes of this presentation  the total commitment is included in the earliest time period as there is no schedule for when the commitment will be funded 
for purposes of this presentation the expiration dates of the credit agreements that provide prologis with six lines of credit include extension periods that are at the option of prologis 
see borrowing capacities 
distribution and dividend requirements prologis common share distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of its cash flow that ensures that prologis will meet the distribution requirements of the code and that allows prologis to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow typically will be greater than operating income and net earnings 
cash distributions per common share paid in  and were  and  respectively 
the board set a projected annual distribution rate for of per common share 
prologis paid a distribution for the first quarter of of per common share on february  to holders of common shares at february  the payment of common share distributions is subject to the discretion of the board  is dependent on prologis financial condition and operating results and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 
prologis has increased its common share distribution level every year since its common shares became publicly traded in at december   prologis had three series of preferred shares outstanding 
the annual dividend rates on prologis preferred shares are per series c preferred share  per series f preferred share and per series g preferred share 

table of contents pursuant to the terms of its preferred shares  prologis is restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to its common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the then current dividend period with respect to the preferred shares 
other commitments at december   prologis had letters of intent or contingent contracts  subject to prologis final due diligence  for the acquisition of properties aggregating million square feet at an estimated total acquisition cost of million 
through march   prologis completed the acquisition of one of these properties  a million square foot property at a total acquisition cost of million 
the remaining transactions are subject to a number of conditions and prologis cannot predict with certainty that they will be consummated 
under a common share repurchase program that began in january  prologis may repurchase up to million of common shares 
the common shares that have been repurchased to date were purchased in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market prices and other conditions 
future repurchases  if any  are expected to be through similar transactions 
prologis has repurchased  common shares under this program at a total cost of million  although no repurchases have occurred in or for the period from january  to march  prologis does not currently expect that it will make significant common share repurchases during the remainder of prologis  from time to time  enters into special limited contribution agreements slca in connection with certain of its contributions of properties to certain of its property funds 
under the slcas  prologis is obligated to make an additional capital contribution to the respective property fund under certain circumstances  the occurrence of which prologis believes to be remote 
specifically  prologis would be required to make an additional capital contribution if the property fund s third party lender  whose loans to the property fund are generally secured by the property fund s assets and are non recourse  does not receive a specified minimum level of debt repayment 
however  the proceeds received by the third party lender from the exhaustion of all of the assets of the property fund combined with the debt repayments received directly from the property fund will reduce prologis obligations under the slca on a dollar for dollar basis 
prologis potential obligations under the respective slcas  as a percentage of the assets in the property funds  range from to 
accordingly  the value of the assets of the respective property funds would have to decline by between and before prologis would be required to make an additional capital contribution 
prologis believes that the likelihood of declines in the values of the assets that support the third party loans of the magnitude necessary to require an additional capital contribution is remote  especially in light of the geographically diversified portfolios of properties owned by the property funds 
accordingly  these potential obligations have not been recognized as a liability by prologis at december  and prologis has assessed a nominal value to the guarantee undertaken through the slcas 
the potential obligations under the slcas aggregate million at december  and the combined book value of the assets in the property funds  before depreciation  that are subject to the provisions of the slcas was approximately billion at december  derivative financial instruments prologis uses derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage well defined risk associated with interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on existing or anticipated obligations and transactions 
prologis does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the primary risks associated with derivative instruments are market risk and credit risk 
market risk is defined as the potential for loss in the value of the derivative due to adverse changes in market prices interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows prologis to manage the risks of increases in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the effects these fluctuations would have on prologis income and cash flows 

table of contents credit risk is the risk that one of the parties to a derivative contract fails to perform or meet their financial obligation under the contract 
prologis does not obtain collateral to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of counterparties  primarily global commercial banks 
prologis does not anticipate non performance by any of the counterparties to its derivative contracts 
however  should a counterparty fail to perform  prologis would incur a financial loss to the extent there exists a positive fair market value attributable to prologis derivative positions 
at december   prologis had outstanding a forward starting interest rate swap contract in the notional amount of million related to an anticipated transaction 
the contract  which is designated as a cash flow hedge  allows prologis to fix the interest rate associated with a portion of a debt instrument forecasted to be issued in for a four year period 
the interest rate swap contract qualifies for hedge accounting treatment 
prologis recognized a mark to market adjustment representing a net decrease in the value of this contract of million in other comprehensive income in shareholders equity at december  funds from operations funds from operations is a financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry 
although nareit has published a definition of funds from operations  modifications to the nareit calculation of funds from operations are common among reits  as companies seek to provide performance measures that meaningfully reflect their business 
funds from operations  as defined by prologis  is presented as a supplemental performance measure 
funds from operations is not used by prologis as  nor should it be considered to be  an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis ability to fund its cash needs 
funds from operations is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor does prologis intend it to present  a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance 
prologis believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that funds from operations is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings 
further  prologis believes that its consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 
nareit s funds from operations measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated properties 
prologis agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation charges  that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
consequently  nareit s definition of funds from operations reflects the fact that real estate  as an asset class  generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 
b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long term ownership and management of real estate 
the exclusion  in nareit s definition of funds from operations  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
at the same time that nareit created and defined its funds from operations concept for the reit industry  it also recognized that management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community 
prologis 
table of contents believes that financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders who review its operating results are best served by a defined funds from operations measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of funds from operations 
the prologis defined funds from operations measure excludes the following items from net earnings computed under gaap that are not excluded in the nareit defined funds from operations measure i deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by prologis taxable subsidiaries  ii certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from certain debt transactions between prologis and its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees  iii foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of certain third party debt of prologis foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees  and iv mark to market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments utilized to manage prologis foreign currency risks 
funds from operations of prologis unconsolidated investees is calculated on the same basis as prologis 
the items that prologis excludes from net earnings  while not infrequent or unusual  are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative effects on prologis results of operations  in inconsistent and unpredictable directions 
most importantly  the economics underlying the items that prologis excludes from net earnings are not the primary drivers in management s decision making process and capital investment decisions 
period to period fluctuations in these items can be driven by accounting for short term factors that are not relevant to long term investment decisions  long term capital structures or to long term tax planning and tax structuring decisions 
accordingly  prologis believes that investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of prologis operating results along the same lines that prologis management uses in planning and executing its business strategy 
real estate is a capital intensive business 
investors analyses of the performance of real estate companies tend to be centered on understanding the asset value created by real estate investment decisions and understanding current operating returns that are being generated by those same investment decisions 
the adjustments to net earnings that are included in arriving at the prologis defined funds from operations measure are helpful to management in making real estate investment decisions and evaluating its current operating performance 
prologis believes that these adjustments are also helpful to industry analysts  potential investors and shareholders in their understanding and evaluation of prologis performance on the key measures of net asset value and current operating returns generated on real estate investments

table of contents risk factors prologis operations involve various risks that could adversely affect prologis financial condition  results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of prologis common shares 
these risks include  among others general real estate risks general economic conditions prologis is exposed to the general economic conditions and the local  regional  national and international economic conditions that affect the markets in which it owns properties 
prologis operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which it has concentrations of properties 
prologis does not have in excess of of its directly owned portfolio in any one market  nor does it have in excess of of its total portfolio including properties owned by the property funds in any one market 
however  prologis does have significant holdings in atlanta  chicago  dallas ft 
worth  houston  los angeles  new jersey  paris  san francisco and certain other markets in france and the united kingdom 
prologis operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions in the markets with concentrations of properties  such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space  become less favorable 
any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction of demand for distribution space could adversely affect prologis results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of prologis common shares 
risks particular to real estate real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
while prologis seeks to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of its portfolio  market research and its property management capabilities  these risks cannot be eliminated 
the factors that can affect real estate values include changes in the general economic climate  local conditions  such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space in an area  the attractiveness of prologis properties to potential customers  competition from other available properties  prologis ability to provide adequate maintenance of  and insurance on  its properties  prologis ability to control variable operating costs  governmental regulations  including zoning  usage and tax laws and changes in these laws  and potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning and other laws 
risks associated with concentration of prologis investments in the industrial sector prologis investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector 
this concentration may expose prologis to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if prologis business activities included other types of real estate investments 
risks associated with prologis development activities prologis has developed a significant number of distribution properties since its inception and intends to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise 
such development activities generally require 
table of contents various government and other approvals and prologis may not receive such approvals 
prologis will be subject to risks associated with such development activities including  but not limited to the risk that development opportunities explored by prologis may be abandoned and that the related investment will be written off  the risk that construction costs of a property may exceed the original estimates or that construction may not be concluded on schedule could make the project less profitable than originally estimated  specific risks include  but are not limited to  the possibility of contract default  the effects of local weather conditions  the possibility of local or national strikes and the possibility of shortages in materials  building supplies or energy and fuel for equipment  and the risk that occupancy levels and the rents that can be charged for a completed project will not make the project as profitable as originally estimated 
risks associated with the contribution and sale of properties prologis has contributed to property funds  or sold to third parties a significant number of distribution properties in recent years 
prologis intends to continue to contribute and sell properties as opportunities arise  particularly from its cdfs business segment 
prologis ability to contribute or sell properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon several factors  some of which are beyond the control of prologis management  primarily competition from other owners of distribution properties that are trying to dispose of their properties 
prologis ability to develop and timely lease properties will impact prologis ability to contribute or sell these properties 
continued access to private debt and equity capital by the property funds is necessary in order for prologis to continue its strategy of contributing properties to the property funds 
should prologis not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds  or should the property funds have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms  then these contributions could be delayed resulting in adverse effects on prologis liquidity and on its ability to meet projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period 
failure to meet its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on prologis results of operations  distributable cash flow and on the value of prologis common shares 
further  prologis inability to redeploy the proceeds from its divestitures in accordance with its investment strategy could have an adverse effect on prologis results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares in subsequent periods 
risks associated with acquisition of properties prologis acquires distribution properties from time to time 
the acquisition of properties involves risks  including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and the risk that any actual costs for rehabilitation  repositioning  renovation and improvements identified in the pre acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates 
there is  and it is expected that there will continue to be  significant competition for investment opportunities that meet prologis investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities  if necessary 
tenant default prologis results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares would be adversely affected if a significant number of prologis tenants are unable to meet their lease obligations to prologis 
in the event of default by a significant number of tenants  prologis may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlord 
ability to renew leases or re lease space as leases expire prologis results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares would be adversely affected if prologis is unable to lease  on economically favorable terms  a significant amount of space in its distribution properties 
prologis had million square feet of distribution space with leases that either expired on december  or were on a month to month basis at that date and prologis has 
table of contents million square feet of distribution space out of a total of million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in in its directly owned properties 
the property funds had a combined million square feet of distribution space with leases that either expired on december  or were on a month to month basis at that date and the property funds have a combined million square feet of distribution space out of a total of million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in the number of distribution properties in a market or submarket could adversely affect both prologis ability to re lease distribution space and the rental rates that can be obtained in new leases 
for the past two years  prologis rental rates on new or renewed leases of previously leased distribution space have declined 
real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit prologis ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  significant expenditures associated with real estate investments  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments 
like other companies qualifying as reits under the code  prologis must comply with the safe harbor rules relating to the number of properties that can be disposed of in a year  the tax bases and the costs of improvements made to these properties  and meet other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets 
thus  prologis ability at any time to sell assets  or contribute assets to property funds or other entities in which prologis has an ownership interest may be restricted 
prologis insurance coverage does not include all potential losses prologis and its unconsolidated investees currently carry comprehensive insurance coverage including property  liability  fire  flood  earthquake  environmental  terrorism  extended coverage and rental loss as appropriate for the markets where each of their properties and their business operations are located 
the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties  business activities and markets 
prologis believes its properties and the properties of its unconsolidated investees are adequately insured 
however  there are certain losses  including losses from floods  earthquakes  acts of war  acts of terrorism or riots  that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed to be economically feasible or prudent to do so 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of prologis properties  prologis could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 
potential environmental liability under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner  developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  on  under or in its property 
the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of such hazardous substances 
prologis conducts phase i environmental assessments as part of its due diligence activities 
prologis has not been notified nor is prologis aware of any environmental condition with respect to its real estate assets that are likely to be material to prologis financial condition 
however  prologis cannot give any assurance that such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future 
the presence of such substances on prologis real estate investments could adversely affect its ability to sell such investments or to borrow using such investments as collateral and may also have an adverse effect on prologis distributable cash flow 

table of contents financing and capital risks access to capital prologis  as a reit  is required to distribute at least of its taxable income to its shareholders 
consequently  prologis is  as are all reits  largely dependent on external capital to fund its development and acquisition activities 
prologis has been accessing private debt and equity capital through the establishment of property funds that acquire properties from prologis 
prologis ability to access private debt and equity capital through its property funds on favorable terms  or at all  is dependent upon a number of factors  including general market conditions and competition from other real estate companies 
further  prologis generates significant profits as a result of the contributions of properties to the property funds 
to the extent that private capital is not available to the property funds to allow them to acquire properties from prologis  these profits may not be realized or their realization may be delayed which could result in an earnings stream that is less predictable than some of prologis competitors and result in prologis not meeting its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period 
failure to meet its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on the value of common shares 
prologis is committed to offer to contribute all of its stabilized development properties available in specific markets in europe to prologis european properties fund through september and all of its stabilized development properties available in japan to prologis japan properties fund through june these property funds are committed to acquire such properties  subject to the property meeting certain specified criteria  including leasing criteria  and having available capital 
prologis believes that  while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds may be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments  each property fund does have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available during prologis north american properties fund v has the right of first offer to all of prologis stabilized development properties that prologis desires to sell in north america except those properties that are subject to an agreement with prologis california through the end of properties subject to the right of first offer must meet certain specified criteria  including leasing criteria 
while prologis north american properties fund v s majority owner is a listed property trust in australia that is able to raise capital in the public market  there can be no assurance that prologis north american properties fund v will have the available capital to acquire additional properties from prologis in or  if capital is available  that prologis north american properties fund v will want to use its capital to acquire properties from prologis 
should prologis north american properties fund v choose not to acquire  or not have sufficient capital available to acquire  a property that meets the specified criteria  its rights under the agreement will terminate 
prologis ability to contribute or sell its development pipeline and recognize profits from its development activities will be jeopardized and prologis ability to meet its projected earnings levels and generate distributable cash flow would be adversely affected should the existing equity commitments not be available due to investor default or otherwise such that these property funds cannot acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available for contribution 
this impact would occur in the short term and would continue until prologis is able to sell the properties to third parties or until prologis could secure another source of private equity capital to form a new property fund 
debt financing prologis is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that prologis cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness  that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness  or otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness 
prologis utilizes the short term borrowing capabilities over billion as of december  provided by six credit agreements that provide lines of credit to prologis in addition to operating cash flow and proceeds from dispositions to fund its development  acquisition and distribution requirements 
prologis six 
table of contents lines of credits expire through million of borrowing capacity expires during  million of borrowing capacity expires during and million of borrowing capacity expires during 
these expiration dates are based on available extension periods if such extentions are at prologis option 
prologis ability to refinance these credit agreements in a timely manner and at favorable terms is dependent on several factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  prologis credit ratings and interest rate levels 
prologis short term credit agreements bear interest at variable rates 
increases in interest rates would increase prologis interest expense under these agreements 
if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations  the amount of prologis distributable cash flow would be adversely affected 
requirements of credit agreements the terms of prologis various credit agreements and other indebtedness require prologis to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants  such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage 
these covenants may limit prologis flexibility in its operations  and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if prologis has satisfied its payment obligations 
if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations  the amount of prologis distributable cash flow would be adversely affected 
federal income tax risks failure to qualify as a reit could adversely affect shareholders prologis elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year ended december  to maintain reit status  prologis must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis 
those requirements seek to ensure  among other things  that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related  that a reit distributes substantially all its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit s equity ownership is not overly concentrated 
due to the complex nature of these rules  the available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules  the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law  administrative interpretations of the law and changes in prologis business  no assurance can be given that prologis will qualify as a reit for any particular year 
if prologis fails to qualify as a reit  it will be taxed as a regular corporation  and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing prologis taxable income 
the resulting corporate income tax liabilities could materially reduce the distributable cash flow to prologis shareholders and funds available for reinvestment 
moreover  prologis might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which prologis ceased to qualify as a reit 
in addition  if prologis later requalified as a reit  it might be required to pay a full corporate level tax on any unrealized gains in its assets as of the date of requalification and to make distributions to shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of non reit status 
in the absence of reit status  distributions to shareholders would no longer be required 
potential adverse effect of reit distribution requirements to maintain its qualification as a reit under the code  prologis must annually distribute to its shareholders at least of its reit taxable income  excluding the dividends paid deduction and its net capital gains 
this requirement limits prologis ability to accumulate capital 
prologis may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements 
difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for prologis funds or to timing differences between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements  because income may have to be reported before cash is received  because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because deductions may be disallowed or limited  or the internal revenue service may make a determination that adjusts reported income 
in those situations  prologis might be required to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in 
table of contents order to meet the distribution requirements and interest and penalties could apply 
if prologis fails to make a required distribution  it would cease to be taxed as a reit 
prohibited transaction income could result from certain property transfers prologis contributes properties to property funds and sells properties to third parties  including contributions and sales of properties from prologis taxable subsidiaries 
under the code  a disposition of a property from other than a taxable subsidiary could be deemed to be a prohibited transaction 
in such case  a penalty tax on the resulting gain could be assessed 
the determination that a transaction constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction 
the internal revenue service could contend that certain contributions or sales of properties by prologis are prohibited transactions 
while prologis management does not believe that the internal revenue service would prevail in such a dispute  if the internal revenue service successfully argued the matter  the penalty tax could be assessed against the gains from these transactions 
additionally  any gain from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect prologis ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 
other risks prologis is dependent on key personnel prologis executive officers and other senior officers have a significant role in prologis success 
the ability of prologis to retain its management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave prologis is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market 
the loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely impact prologis financial condition and cash flow 
further  such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets 
share prices may be affected by market interest rates the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of such common shares 
an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate than prologis has set  which could adversely affect the value of prologis common shares 
foreign currency risk prologis has pursued and intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets and often invests in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency 
as a result  prologis is subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar 
for example  a significant depreciation in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where prologis has a significant investment may materially adversely affect prologis results of operations and the value of its common shares 
prologis attempts to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and by entering into derivative contracts  although there can be no assurance that such attempts will be successful in neutralizing all foreign currency risks 
government regulations and actions there are many laws and governmental regulations that are applicable to prologis  its unconsolidated investees and their properties 
changes in these laws and governmental regulations  or their interpretation by agencies or the courts  could occur 
further  economic and political factors  including civil unrest  governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders in the united states  but primarily in the foreign countries in which prologis has invested  can have a major impact on a global company such as prologis 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk prologis is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
prologis has used certain derivative financial instruments  primarily foreign currency put option contracts  to reduce its foreign currency market risk 
to a lesser extent  prologis has used interest rate swap agreements to reduce its interest rate market risk 
prologis does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with polices that have been approved by the board 
prologis has estimated its market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis 
prologis has defined its market risk exposure as i the potential loss in future earnings and cash flows due to interest rate exposure and ii the future loss in future earnings with respect to foreign currency exchange exposure 
prologis sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical adverse change in year end interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value 
as a result  prologis ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period  hedging strategies at the time  and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk prologis interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective  prologis borrows on a fixed rate basis for longer term debt issuances 
in anticipation of a financing expected to occur in  prologis has a forward starting interest rate swap contract outstanding that is designated as a cash flow hedge to fix the interest rate on a portion of the expected financing 
if the expected financing occurs in the projected time frame  any increase in interest rates would be offset by the positive value of the contract and any decrease in interest rates would be offset by the negative value of the contract  in each case for the hedged amount of the expected financing 
if the expected financing did not occur and the contracts were unwound  based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in interest rates  the estimated market risk exposure for the forward starting interest rate swap contracts would be approximately million for both future earnings and cash flows for the year ended december  prologis primary interest rate risk is created by its variable rate lines of credit 
during the year ended december   prologis had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of million on its variable rate lines of credit 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in interest rates  the estimated market risk exposure for prologis variable rate lines of credit was approximately million for both future earnings and cash flows for the year ended december  the sensitivity analysis was based on the weighted average outstanding variable rate borrowings for and assumed a flat yield curve for the year 
although prologis has no derivative contracts as hedges of its variable rate revolving lines of credit  prologis may in the future fix existing variable rate borrowings to manage its interest rate exposure 
foreign currency risk prologis incurs foreign currency exchange risk related to third party and intercompany debt of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees that are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or investee 
the remeasurement of certain of this debt results in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses by prologis 
prologis primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates exists with the following currencies versus the us dollar euro  pound sterling and yen 
based on the results of a sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the estimated market risk exposure to future earnings associated with this debt was million at december  prologis primarily uses foreign currency put option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income operating income net of foreign denominated interest 
table of contents expense of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees 
however  at december   prologis did not have any foreign currency put option contracts outstanding 
prologis translates to us dollars the income and expenses of its consolidated foreign subsidiaries and its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of its unconsolidated investees recognized under the equity method 
prologis hedges the foreign currency exchange risk associated with approximately to of the forecasted net operating income from its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees through foreign currency put option contracts 
the effect of the change in foreign currency exchange rates on translated income and expenses of prologis foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees has a high degree of inverse correlation with the derivative instruments used to hedge it  when rates go above the option strike rate when rates are below or are expected to be below  there is no offset 
since prologis hedges approximately to of its projected net operating income from its foreign subsidiaries and investees for foreign currency rate fluctuations above the option strike rate  approximately to of the impact to the net earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and investees of an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates would not be offset by derivative instruments 
fair value of financial instruments the following estimates of the fair value of financial instruments have been determined by prologis using available market information and valuation methodologies believed to be appropriate for these purposes 
considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and  accordingly  they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that prologis would realize upon disposition 
at december  and  the carrying amounts of certain financial instruments employed by prologis  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses and construction costs payable were representative of their fair values due to the short term maturity of these instruments 
similarly  the carrying values of the lines of credit and short term borrowings balances outstanding approximate their fair values as of those dates since the interest rates on the lines of credit and short term borrowings are based on current market rates 
at december  and  the fair values of prologis senior notes  secured debt including mortgage notes and securitized debt and assessment bonds have been estimated based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities 
the differences in the fair values of prologis senior notes  secured debt and assessment bonds from the carrying values in the table below are the result of differences in the interest rates available to prologis at december  and from the interest rates that were in effect when the debt was issued 
the senior notes and many of the secured debt issues contain pre payment penalties or yield maintenance provisions that could make the cost of refinancing the debt at the lower rates exceed the benefit that would be derived from doing so 
at december  and  the fair values of prologis derivative financial instruments are the amounts at which they could be settled  based on quoted market prices or estimates obtained from brokers or dealers 
as prologis marks its derivative financial instruments to market  their fair values are the same as their carrying values 
the carry value of the foreign currency forward contract is included as other liabilities and the carrying values of the foreign currency put option contracts and the interest rate swap contracts are included as other assets in prologis consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents the following table reflects the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of prologis financial instruments as of the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars december  carrying carrying value fair value value fair value senior notes secured debt and assessment bonds mortgage notes and securitized debt assessment bonds total secured debt and assessment bonds derivative financial instruments foreign currency put option contracts foreign currency forward contract interest rate swap contracts
