see forward looking statements on page ii 
overview we are a development stage biotechnology company engaged in research and development of products and processes intended to treat major medical indications such as cardiovascular disease and viral infections in which lipids  or fat components  play a key role 
our primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development  including pre clinical studies  performing business  strategic and financial planning  and raising capital  including  from the date of the merger between nz and pre merger lipid  disposing of company real estate assets 
accordingly  the company is considered to be in the development stage 
on november   the merger between nz and pre merger lipid was completed 
the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and was treated as a reverse acquisition because the stockholders of pre merger lipid owned the majority of the company s common stock immediately after the merger 
pre merger lipid was considered the acquiror for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  all financial information prior to november  included in this report reflects pre merger lipid results 
as a result of the merger  certain real estate assets were acquired  and thus our business was organized into two segments biotechnology and real estate 
on march   we formalized a plan to discontinue the operations of our real estate segment  and as of december   we have completed the disposition of substantially all of these real estate assets and our business is no longer organized into two segments 
the remaining real estate asset  classified as assets held for sale as of december   was sold in february for  therefore  as of the date of this filing  the company has no remaining real estate assets 
in the course of our research and development activities  we have incurred significant operating losses and we expect these losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development and begin to allocate significant and increasing resources to clinical testing and other activities related to seeking approval to market our products 
we intend to finance our operations through public or private equity or debt financings  the pursuit of research and development grants  and cash on hand 
we anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will provide sufficient working capital for our operations  which includes our current development projects  through at least the early part of in the longer term  we expect to additionally finance our operations through revenues from product sales and licenses  including outlicensing opportunities of our proprietary delipidation process for non human health applications such as the field of animal health  upon receiving all relevant approvals 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy our requirements we may have to substantially reduce  or eliminate  certain areas of our product development activities  significantly limit our operations  or otherwise modify our business strategy 
on september   we announced the initiation of a non human primate study conducted at the wake forest university baptist medical center under the direction of dr 
lawrence l 
rudel 
this pre clinical animal study is designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the company s hdl therapy in a relevant human like model 
the data acquisition phase of lipid sciences pre clinical non human study has now been completed 
the study subjects  african green monkeys  a widely accepted model for human atherosclerosis  were first surveyed with ivus to determine the presence and composition of atherosclerotic plaque 
they then received a sequence of weekly infusions of plasma that had been delipidated by lipid sciences proprietary process and device 
the infusions appear to have been well tolerated by the study subjects 
the effectiveness endpoint of this study will be the measurement of arterial plaque regression as determined by comparing plaque volume by ivus at the beginning and end of the treatment cycle 
this complex body of ivus data acquired in the study  consisting of several hundred thousand cross sectional images  is now being organized  collated  and edited in preparation for analysis by dr 
steven e 
nissen  md  facc  vice chairman of cardiology at the cleveland clinic foundation and his colleagues 
we anticipate that the analysis of the study data will be completed by mid year 
we believe that a successful conclusion of this innovative study would potentially lead to a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases  such as heart attacks and strokes  in high risk patients 
in january  the company forwarded a comprehensive information package to the center for devices and radiological health  or cdrh  of the fda for their review in advance of a pre ide  or investigational device exemption  meeting which is now scheduled for the end of march this meeting will begin the discussion of the steps necessary to proceed with the submission of an ide the approval of which is necessary in order for us to initiate a human clinical trial 
results of continuing operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenue 
we recognized  in grant revenue in this grant revenue relates to the small business technology transfer sttr grant awarded in the second quarter of by the national institutes of health nih  for a virion solvent treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
we have had no product revenues since our inception may  
future product revenues will depend on our ability to develop and commercialize our two primary platforms for the treatment of cardiovascular disease hdl therapy and viral infections viral immunotherapy 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include applied and scientific research  regulatory  and business development expenses 
research and development expenses for increased  or  to  from  in the increase was due primarily to an  increase in stock compensation expense   of which was due to the modification of our scientific advisory board members option agreements to extend the expiration date of those options  and increases in outside research expenses related to our non human primate study that commenced in the third quarter of at the wake forest university baptist medical center in winstom salem  north carolina 
this increase was partially offset by the absence of external development services performed by sri under the development agreement  restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter of  and consulting fees related to the karuba agreement which was terminated in august research and development expenses accounted for approximately of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  while we allocate and track resources when required pursuant to the terms of development arrangements  our research team typically works on different products concurrently  and our equipment and intellectual property resources often are deployed over a range of products with a view to maximize the benefit of our investment 
accordingly  we have not  and do not intend to  separately track the costs for each of our research projects on a product by product basis 
for the year ended december   however  we estimate that the majority of our research and development expense was associated with our two primary platforms  hdl therapy and viral immunotherapy 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our business operations  inclusive of management  legal  finance  and accounting expenses 
general and administrative expenses for decreased  or  to  from  in the decrease was due primarily to the absence of restructuring charges in and a reduction in employee related and consulting expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by a  increase in stock compensation expense and increased investor relations and public company related expenses 
general and administrative expenses accounted for approximately of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  interest and other income 
interest and other income for decreased  or  to  from  in the decrease was due primarily to the absence of a gain recognized from the payoff of a note receivable in  coupled with a loss recognized on the early payoff of two notes receivable in the three months ended june  all three of these notes receivable were reclassified from discontinued operations to assets held for use during the three months ended march  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
this decrease was partially offset by higher average cash and short term investment balances coupled with higher investment yields during the twelve months ended december  results of continuing operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenue 
we did not recognize any grant revenue in or we have had no product revenues since our inception may  
future product revenues will depend on our ability to develop and commercialize our two primary platforms for the treatment of cardiovascular disease hdl therapy and viral infections viral immunotherapy 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include applied and scientific research  regulatory  and business development expenses 
research and development expenses for decreased  or  to  from  in the decrease was due primarily to reduced external development services  royalty expenses incurred in related to the initiation of our human clinical trial  employee related expenses as a result of our restructuring activities  as well as the cessation of all operations in australia in january this decrease was partially offset by an increase in business development expenses as a result of our restructuring activities  the restructuring charge recorded in the first quarter of  and stock compensation expense  a non cash charge related to issuance of stock options to viral advisory board members 
on july   the scope of the development agreement with sri international was amended to focus on providing applied research and development services in support of advancing our viral immunotherapy platform  significantly reducing our spending 
research and development expenses accounted for approximately of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our business operations  inclusive of management  legal  finance  and accounting expenses 
general and administrative expenses for decreased  or  to  from  in the decrease was due primarily to a reduction in investor and public relations related expenses  legal  consulting  and accounting fees  employee related expenses as a result of our restructuring activities  and advisory fees paid to mdb capital group  llc as a result of the merger between nz and pre merger lipid 
additionally  we reclassified all costs related to business development to research and development expense for the twelve months ended december  this decrease was partially offset by the restructuring charge recorded in the first quarter of and stock compensation expense  a non cash charge related to issuance of stock to consultants 
general and administrative expenses accounted for approximately of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  interest and other income 
interest and other income for increased  or  to  from  in the increase was due primarily to gains recognized from the payoff of two notes in this increase was partially offset by lower average cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances coupled with lower interest rates throughout results of discontinued operations years ended december   and in october  the united states department of the interior  minerals management service  issued the company royalty credits in exchange for our remaining mineral rights in new mexico 
royalty credits are used by the united states department of the interior for payment of royalties due under oil and gas leases located on the outer continental shelf 
based on a valuation performed at the time of the merger with nz  zero value was recorded for these mineral rights and therefore prior to the exchange they had no carrying value 
as a result of this exchange the company recognized a gain of  representing the estimated fair value of the royalty credits less the costs to sell the credits 
as of december  the fair value of the credits was recorded in assets held for sale 
in february  the company sold the royalty rights and received cash of  during the twelve months ended december   the company recorded net income from discontinued operations of  as compared to a net loss of  recorded in the change was attributable to the absence of a valuation charge recorded on real property in california  a reduction in administrative costs as a result of the cessation of our real estate operations in arizona  and gains recognized on the sale of mineral rights described above and real property in new mexico 
as of december   we have successfully disposed of substantially all real estate assets acquired in the merger 
therefore  we expect any future losses from discontinued operations to be immaterial to our consolidated operations 
during the twelve months ended december   we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of  as compared to income from discontinued operations of  in the twelve months ended december  this represented an  decrease in income between and  and was largely attributable to the absence of gains recognized on the sale of various assets acquired in the merger see note of the consolidated financial statements 
during the three months ended march   the company reclassified the remaining assets of a component of the real estate business from discontinued operations to assets held for use 
these assets consisted of certain notes receivable secured by real estate  which the company obtained as a result of providing seller financing of prior real estate sales 
as a result  notes receivable with a carrying value of  at december  were reclassified from current assets of discontinued operations to notes receivable 
the results of operations of this component  previously reported in discontinued operations through december   were also reclassified and included in interest and other income for all periods presented 
income of  and  for the twelve months ended december  and the period from inception may  to december   respectively  have been reclassified to interest and other income 
all related income tax expenses benefits and accrued interest have been reclassified accordingly 
of the notes receivable reclassified to assets held for use  one note was prepaid in its entirety in june and the remaining two notes were prepaid at a discount in may these payoffs reduced the carrying value of the reclassified assets to zero at december  liquidity and capital resources pre merger lipid financed its operations principally through two private placements of equity securities  which yielded net proceeds of approximately  and the sale of common stock to one of its founders 
the merger with nz resulted in the acquisition of net assets of approximately  net of repurchase of stock and acquisition costs 
the net cash used in operating activities was approximately  for the year ended december   resulted primarily from operating losses incurred as adjusted for non cash compensation charges  partially offset by the early payoff of two notes receivable 
the net cash used in operating activities was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulting primarily from operating losses incurred as adjusted for deferred income taxes and non cash stock compensation charges  and the payment of accrued liabilities pertaining to our restructuring activities and the advisory fees due to mdb capital group 
the general decreasing trend in cash used in operations reflects the successful implementation of our january strategic plan 
the net cash used in investing activities was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily attributable to the purchase and subsequent maturity of short term investments and purchase of capital equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  was attributable to the proceeds received from the exercise of options and warrants on our common stock 
net cash used in financing activities of approximately  for the year ended december   was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock from dissenting stockholders and additional accrued merger costs 
net cash provided by discontinued operations of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  was primarily due to the sale of real estate assets and collection of principal payments on commercial real estate loans and other notes receivable 
as of december   we have successfully disposed of substantially all real estate assets acquired in the merger 
we have received all proceeds related to the sale of our last real estate asset in february  and therefore we do not expect any future cash provided by or used in discontinued operations to be of a material amount 
in december  we entered into an intellectual property license agreement to obtain the exclusive worldwide rights to certain patents  trademarks  and technology with aruba international pty 
ltd  an australian company  controlled by bill e 
cham  phd  a founding stockholder of pre merger lipid and one of our former directors 
as consideration for the license  we issued aruba  shares of our common stock valued at  under this agreement  we are obligated to pay aruba a continuing royalty on revenue in future years  subject to a minimum annual royalty amount of  of any external research funding initiated by dr 
cham and received by us to further this technology  as defined in the agreement  and  upon commencement of our initial human clinical trial utilizing the technology under the patents 
our initial human clinical trial commenced during the three month period ended june  in november  all rights  title  interest and obligations covered under the intellectual property license agreement were assigned to aruba international bv  a netherlands company  controlled by dr 
cham 
in may  we sold a total of  shares of common stock at per share in a private placement to accredited investors 
net cash proceeds  after expenses  were approximately  in october  we entered into a development agreement with sri international  a california nonprofit public benefit corporation  pursuant to which sri provides us with various consulting and development services defined in the development agreement as phase i and phase ii 
phase i was completed on march  for total fees of  phase ii was initiated upon the completion of phase i for fees not to exceed  in connection with the development agreement  we issued sri a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant vested with respect to  shares upon completion of phase i 
the remaining  shares would vest upon completion of two  phase ii development milestones 
if either development milestone is discontinued at the option of the company  all  remaining warrant shares would vest at the completion of the remaining milestone 
neither milestone related to phase ii has been completed 
on april   sri exercised  of their  warrant shares to purchase  shares of our common stock 
consistent with our restructuring initiatives  we have refocused our development efforts internally  resulting in a significant reduction in spending related to the development agreement 
in march  we closed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share for gross proceeds of  in connection with the private placement  we paid a commission to mdb capital group  llc of approximately of the gross proceeds  payable in shares of common stock  for services rendered in the private placement 
accordingly   shares of common stock at per share were issued as commission for the transaction 
in june  pre merger lipid engaged mdb capital group  llc as its financial advisor in the merger between nz and pre merger lipid 
the engagement letter committed the company to pay mdb capital group an advisory fee 
in december  we paid mdb capital group approximately  which represented a portion of the advisory fee based on of the cash and cash equivalents of the company immediately after the merger  as compared to pre merger lipid s cash and cash equivalents immediately prior to the merger 
the remainder of the advisory fee was based on of the gross sales of the company s pre merger assets during the two year period after the closing of the merger  the company s assets on the two year anniversary of the merger and the net operating income of the company derived from the company s pre merger assets during the two year period after the closing of the merger 
approximately  and  of the advisory fee was paid during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
on the two year anniversary of the merger  the company determined the remainder of the advisory fee to be  which was paid to mdb capital group  llc in january in connection with the merger  the company was obligated to issue additional shares of common stock to those individuals and entities who were stockholders of nz on the day prior to the completion of the merger and who perfected certain stock purchase rights received in connection with the merger 
each perfected right entitled the holder to receive up to one additional share of the company s common stock 
nz stockholders had until april  to become the registered owner of the company s common stock and were required to continue to hold their shares in direct registered form through november  to perfect each right and receive an additional share of the company s common stock 
transfer of shares of the company s common stock before november  would disqualify the right attached to the transferred shares 
we issued approximately  and  shares of the company s common stock in and  respectively  to those individuals and entities who were stockholders of nz corporation on the day prior to the completion of the merger and who perfected their rights to receive additional shares of the company s common stock 
we have a non cancelable lease agreement for the office space in pleasanton  california  which expires in september rent expense for  and was approximately   and  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under this lease agreement total our principal uses of funds are expected to be the payment of operating expenses and continued research and development funding to support our hdl therapy and viral immunotherapy platforms 
the expected use of funds related to our hdl therapy platform includes costs associated with conclusion of the animal study at wake forest university and increasing investment in resources needed to prepare for a human clinical trial 
currently  our principal sources of funds are expected to be cash on hand 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments equal to approximately  we anticipate that these assets will provide sufficient working capital for our operations  which include our current development projects  through at least the early part of we expect additional capital will be required in the future 
our board of directors continues to consider various strategic initiatives  including third party inquiries  public or private equity or debt financings  the formation of strategic development or licensing partnerships  and strategic business combinations 
however  there can be no assurance that funds secured from any of these efforts  if obtained  will be sufficient to meet the company s future cash requirements 
contractual obligations future estimated contractual obligations are total in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations royalty payments  other long term liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet total  while the company does have various consulting agreements  these agreements are cancelable without penalty  generally with thirty days written notice 
we have agreed to pay annual royalties in the amount of  to aruba international bv in exchange for the exclusive worldwide rights to certain patents  trademarks  and technology 
under certain circumstances  additional payments related to this agreement could be required in the future  however the amounts presented in the above table reflect the minimum annual royalty amount payable over the next three years 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  required that all registrants disclose and describe their critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we believe that our following accounting policies fit this definition stock compensation the company accounts for stock options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  thus  recognizes no compensation expense for those options granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
as permitted  the company has elected to adopt the disclosure provisions only of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based awards to non employees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
significant judgment is required on the part of management in determining the proper assumptions to use in the computation of the amounts to be disclosed or recorded pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation method 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation model include the risk free interest rate  expected life  volatility and dividend yield of the option 
management bases its assumptions on historical data where available 
however  these assumptions consist of estimates of future market conditions  which are inherently uncertain  and are therefore subject to management s judgement 
income taxes the company follows sfas no  accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have an impact on lipid s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
this statement is effective beginning with our third quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no r and expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio consisting of government issued securities 
these investments are classified as held to maturity and are accounted for at their amortized cost  as per fasb statement no 
as of december   the amortized cost of our investment portfolio  which equaled  exceeded the market value of the investments contained in the portfolio by approximately  we have both the ability and intent to hold the securities contained in the investment portfolio until their respective maturity dates 
additionally  all securities contained in the investment portfolio have maturity dates of less than one year 
therefore  we have concluded that this unrealized loss is not considered other than temporary  as defined by eitf issue the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its applications to certain investments  and we have not recorded any impairment charges related to this unrealized loss
