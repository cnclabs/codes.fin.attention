executive overview our suite of business integration software solutions makes us a leading enabler of real time business 
we use the term real time business to refer to those companies that use current information in their businesses to execute their critical business processes 
we are the successor to a portion of the business of teknekron software systems  inc teknekron developed software  known as the tib technology  for the integration and delivery of market data  such as stock quotes  news and other financial information  in trading rooms of large banks and financial services institutions 
in  teknekron expanded its development efforts to include solutions designed to enable complex and disparate manufacturing equipment and software applications primarily in the semiconductor fabrication market to communicate within the factory environment 
teknekron was acquired by reuters group plc  the global information company  in following the acquisition  continued development of the tib technology was undertaken to expand its use in the financial services markets 
in january  our company  tibco software inc  was established as an entity separate from teknekron 
we were formed to create and market software solutions for use in the integration of business information  processes and applications in diverse markets and industries outside the financial services sector 
in connection with our establishment as a separate entity  reuters transferred to us certain assets and liabilities related to our business and granted to us a royalty free license to the intellectual property from which some of our messaging software products originated 
on june   we acquired staffware plc staffware  a provider of bpm solutions that enable businesses to automate  refine and manage their processes 
the addition of staffware s bpm solutions enabled us to offer our combined customer base an expanded real time business integration solution  by making it easier for our customers to utilize their existing systems through real time information exchange and automation and management of enterprise business processes regardless of where such processes reside 
bpm enables companies to save time and money by driving costs and time out of business processes for example  reducing error rates or manual steps  while at the same time ensuring that business processes are compliant with internal procedures and external regulations 
our acquisition of staffware also increased our distribution capabilities through the cross selling of products into new geographic regions  as well as an expanded customer and partner base 
our products are currently licensed by companies worldwide in diverse industries such as telecommunications  retail  healthcare  manufacturing  energy  transportation  logistics  financial services  government and insurance 
we sell our products through a direct sales force and through alliances with leading software vendors and systems integrators 
our revenue in fiscal years  and consisted primarily of license  consulting and maintenance fees from our customers and distributors  including fees from reuters pursuant to our license agreement  both of which were primarily attributable to sales of our software 
in addition  we receive fees from our customers for providing consulting services 
we also receive revenue from our strategic relationships with business partners who embed our products in their hardware and networking systems as well as from systems integrators who resell our products 

table of contents first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
maintenance revenue is determined based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
consulting and training revenues are typically recognized as the services are performed and are usually on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of our products and generally do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
our revenue is derived from a diverse customer base  and no single customer represented greater than of total revenue during fiscal year or during fiscal year  reuters represented of total revenue 
there were no customers with a balance in excess of of net accounts receivable at november  we establish allowances for doubtful accounts based on our evaluation of collectibility and an allowance for returns and discounts based on specifically identified credits and historical experience 
relationship with reuters reuters had been the primary distributor of our products to customers in the financial services segment from until october through the third quarter of fiscal year  we had a license  maintenance and distribution agreement with reuters pursuant to which reuters was paying us certain minimum guaranteed distribution fees related to sales of our products to financial services customers 
reuters obligations with respect to these minimum guaranteed distribution fees were to expire at the end of calendar reuters guaranteed minimum distribution fees were million for each of the calendar years ended december   and these fees were recognized ratably in the period earned as related party revenue 
under our previous agreement with reuters  we were restricted from selling our products and providing consulting services directly to companies in the financial services market  except in limited circumstances 
accordingly  until october  we relied on reuters and  to a lesser extent  other third party resellers and distributors to sell our products to financial services market customers 
in the past  when we did sell our products to financial services market customers other than through reuters or when we resold reuters products and services  we were required to pay certain fees to reuters  which were recorded as related party cost of revenue 
in october  we entered into a new agreement with reuters relating to the licensing  distribution and maintenance of our products that replaced our original agreement with reuters 
pursuant to the terms of this current agreement  reuters has continued and will continue to act as a non exclusive reseller of our products to certain specified customers in the financial services market until march and pays us a distribution license fee equal to of license revenue it receives from sales to such customers 
reuters may also continue to use our products internally and embed them into its solutions 
we have agreed to provide certain fee based support services to reuters for tibco products reuters uses internally and may provide additional support services if purchased by reuters 
in particular  our current agreement as did our original agreement requires us to provide reuters with internal maintenance and support for a fee of million per year plus an annual cpi based increase until december this amount was recognized ratably over the corresponding period as related party service and maintenance revenue 
we now have the right to market and sell our products  other than risk management and market data distribution products  directly and through third party resellers other than a few specified resellers to customers in the financial services market 
the limitations on our ability to sell risk management and market data distribution products and on reselling through the specified resellers will expire in may reuters has agreed to continue to pay us minimum guaranteed fees in the amount of million per quarter through march the quarterly minimum guaranteed fees are reduced by an amount equal to of the license and maintenance revenues from our sales to financial services companies and  until october  were also reduced by of our maintenance revenue from customers who were transitioned to us by reuters 
after march  we will no longer receive such minimum guaranteed fees and will have to replace such revenue with direct sales either to financial services companies or increased sales in other sectors 
based upon our experience in selling directly into the financial services market since october and the recent increase in our revenues from other markets  we believe that we will be able to replace or reduce the impact of the cessation 
table of contents of the million per quarter in revenue from reuters after march accordingly  while there can be no assurance  we do not believe that the elimination of the guaranteed fees from reuters will have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
reuters has been transitioning maintenance and support of our products for its customers  as well as associated revenue  since entering into this current agreement 
as a result  we have been providing maintenance and support services directly to customers transitioned from reuters since the fourth quarter of fiscal year consequently  service and maintenance revenue and associated costs increased as a result of our assumption of reuters contracts in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and fiscal year  and we expect these increases to continue through at least fiscal year in addition to acting as a reseller of our products in the financial services market  reuters is eligible to receive a fee of between and of revenue from sales to approved customers referred to us by reuters  depending upon the level of assistance reuters provides in supporting the sale 
as of november   reuters owned less than of our outstanding capital stock 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended november  we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for restructuring costs  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  and accounting for investments 
revenue recognition 
we recognize license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by aicpa statement of position revenue from subscription license agreements  which include software  rights to future products and maintenance  is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
revenue on shipments to resellers  when subject to certain rights of return and price protection  is recognized when the products are sold by the resellers to the end user customer and is recorded net of related costs to the resellers 

table of contents we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured at the time of the transaction 
in determining whether the fee is fixed or determinable we compare the payment terms of the transaction to our normal payment terms 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable and recognize revenue as the payments become due 
we assess whether collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including the customer s past transaction history and credit worthiness 
generally  we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
for such arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values of ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based on separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts when the quoted renewal rates are deemed to be substantive 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support period 
fair value of services  such as consulting or training  is based upon separate sales of these services 
consulting and training services are generally billed based on hourly rates and revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed 
consulting services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of our products and generally do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
the determination as to whether services involve significant production  modification or customization of the underlying software code is a matter of judgment and can materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result 
allowance for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on our review of credit profiles of our customers  contractual terms and conditions  current economic trends and historical payment  return and discount experience 
we reassess the allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts each period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
however  unexpected events or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to our future statements of operations and of cash flows 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue or bad debt expense recognized could result 
our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts as a percentage of net revenues were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of activities during the years reported 
based on our results for the year ended november   a one percentage point deviation in our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in an increase or decrease in revenue and or expense of approximately million 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation related to employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
and have adopted the disclosure provisions of the statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and sfas accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas had we accounted for stock based compensation related to employee stock based compensation plans using the fair value method as prescribed by sfas  our net income would have been reduced by million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
also see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we account for stock based compensation related to stock options granted to consultants based on the fair value estimate using the black scholes option pricing model on the date of grant and as remeasured at each reporting date in compliance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
accounting for equity 
table of contents instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
as a result  stock based compensation expense fluctuates as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
compensation expense is amortized using the multiple option approach in compliance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
pursuant to fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 options assumed in a purchase business combination are valued at the date of acquisition at their fair value calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of assumed options is included as a component of the purchase price 
the intrinsic value attributable to unvested options is recorded as unearned stock based compensation and amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options 
in december  fasb issued the sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the pro forma disclosure previously permitted under sfas  which we have provided in note to the consolidated financial statements  will no longer be an acceptable alternative to recognition of expenses in the financial statements 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first reporting period that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
we are required to adopt sfas r starting from the fourth fiscal quarter of we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the extent of such impact 
accounting for restructuring costs 
during fiscal year  we implemented a restructuring plan to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
our restructuring plan resulted in a reduction in headcount and the consolidation of facilities through the closing of excess field offices and relocation of corporate offices into one campus 
our restructuring charges included accruals for the estimated loss on facilities 
the estimated facility costs were based on the company s contractual obligations net of estimated sublease income based on current comparable market rates for leases 
we reassess this liability each period based on market conditions 
revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions  such as the timing and amounts of sublease rental income  either change or do not materialize 
should facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate by approximately million 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
based on the available evidence  which includes our historical levels of us taxable income and stock option deductions  we have provided a valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
our deferred tax assets include net operating losses relating to acquired businesses and the exercise of employee stock options for which any change in associated valuation allowance will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill and a credit to additional paid in capital  respectively 
us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on a cumulative total of million of undistributed earnings for certain non us subsidiaries 
we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us 
table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
due to our cumulative us tax return loss position as of november   we have a valuation allowance in the amount of million against our net deferred tax assets 
if we were to fully release our valuation allowance  we estimate that approximately million of the change would result in an income tax benefit  approximately million would be credited to goodwill and approximately million relating to stock option exercises and related tax credits would be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the following analysis demonstrates the potential effect the full release of our valuation allowance would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data actual release of valuation allowance valuation allowance income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income net income per share  diluted valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
we assess long lived and other intangible assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived and other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method 
as of november   we have not recorded an impairment charge against our long lived or other intangible assets 
on december   we adopted the remaining provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets as related to goodwill and intangibles acquired prior to july  in accordance with sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but  instead  are tested for impairment annually or sooner if circumstances indicate that they might not be recoverable 
additionally  workforce no longer qualifies as a separately identifiable intangible and was reclassified as goodwill 
the adoption of sfas resulted in the cessation of approximately million in goodwill amortization per quarter including reclassified amounts at the time of implementation 
in conjunction with the acquisition of staffware  we have determined that we continued to operate as one reportable segment 
accordingly  we have performed the impairment assessment required under sfas at the enterprise level 
we have used the company s total market capitalization to assess the fair value of the enterprise 
as of november   we have million of goodwill and have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets 
changes in the valuation of goodwill could be substantial 
accounting for investments 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
as of november   million of marketable securities have been classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
marketable securities are presented as current assets as they are subject to use within one year in current operations 
realized gains and losses are recognized based on the specific identification method 
as of november   gross unrealized losses on our investment portfolio totaled million 
the decline in value of these investments is primarily related to changes in interest rates and is considered temporary in nature 

table of contents our investments also include minority equity investments in privately held companies that are generally carried at cost basis and included in other assets on the balance sheet 
the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the companies in which we invested  as well as the volatility inherent in external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment  we consider these factors as well as each of the companies cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  we write down the investment to market value and record the related write down as a loss on investments in our consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal years and  we recognized impairment losses of million and million  respectively  relating to the other than temporary decline in value of certain equity investments 
as of november   minority equity investments totaled million 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether an other than temporary decline in the value of our investments exists 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective 
changes in our assessment of the valuation of our investments could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions do not materialize or change

table of contents total revenue year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages total revenue total revenue increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily due to a general increase in information technology spending 
in october  pursuant to our agreement with reuters  we obtained the right to market and sell our products directly to customers in the financial services market  which also contributed to our growth in revenue in furthermore  our staffware acquisition during fiscal year generated additional revenue 
due to fact that tibco and staffware products are often combined in a single license transaction  we cannot separately report revenue related to the individual software components 
geographically  our total revenue increased by million in the united states  million in europe and million in the pacific rim in fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on total revenue by region 
total revenue decreased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  largely due to the global economic slowdown during that period and a resulting general reduction in information technology spending 
revenue from reuters was million  million and million representing  and of our total revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our revenue from reuters consisted primarily of fees under our license agreement  which includes minimum guaranteed fees of million per quarter  reduced by an amount equal to of the license and maintenance revenues from our sales to financial services companies and  until october  also reduced by of our maintenance revenue from customers who were transitioned to us by reuters  which reuters has agreed to continue to pay through march after march  we will no longer receive such minimum guaranteed fees and will have to replace such revenue with direct sales either to financial services companies or increased sales in other sectors 
based upon our experience in selling directly into the financial services market since october and the recent increase in our revenues from other markets  we believe that we will be able to replace or reduce the impact of the cessation of the million per quarter in revenue from reuters after march accordingly  while there can be no assurance  we do not believe that the elimination of guaranteed fees from reuters will have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to replace the guaranteed revenue from reuters  our results of operations will be negatively impacted 
license revenue year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages license revenue as percent of total revenue license revenue increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased revenue from the financial services  consumer packaged goods  telecommunications and manufacturing sectors  and also due to additional revenue generated from the staffware acquisition 
as mentioned above we cannot separately report incremental revenue solely attributable to the staffware acquisition since tibco and staffware products are often combined in a single sales transaction 

table of contents the total number of license revenue transactions over million increased to in fiscal year  from in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the average deal size for transactions over million was approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
license revenue decreased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year largely due to the global economic slowdown during that period and a resulting general reduction in information technology spending 
we expect that license revenues will remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal year service and maintenance revenue year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages service and maintenance revenue as percent of total revenue service and maintenance revenue increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  and increased for fiscal compared to fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was comprised of million  or a increase in consulting and training services revenue  and million  or a increase in maintenance revenue  primarily due to additional growth in our installed software base  maintenance and support revenue related to financial service customers previously supported by reuters  as well as additional revenue generated by the staffware acquisition 
in accordance with our agreement with reuters  we began providing maintenance and support services directly to customers transitioned from reuters in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which contributed to our growth in service and maintenance revenue in fiscal year service and maintenance revenue increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of additional maintenance revenue related to the growth in our installed software base 
we expect that service and maintenance revenue will remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal year cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of compensation of professional services and customer support personnel and third party contractors and associated expenses related to providing consulting services  the cost of providing maintenance and customer support services  royalties and product fees as well as the amortization of developed technologies acquired through corporate acquisitions 
the majority of our cost of revenue is directly related to our maintenance and service revenue 
year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages cost of revenue  excluding stock based compensation as percent of total revenue cost of revenue remained relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal years  and the increase in absolute dollars of cost of revenue in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
table of contents resulted primarily from an increase of approximately million related to personnel compensation  million for third party contractor compensation and consulting fees  million in travel costs and million in amortization of developed technologies and maintenance agreements  offset by a decrease of million in related parties costs  mainly due to our october agreement with reuters 
increased compensation cost was primarily due to an increase in professional services and customer support staff in fiscal year  and an increase in variable incentive compensation 
increased third party contractor and consulting fees were directly related to increased service and maintenance revenues 
additional amortization of developed technologies was mainly due to the staffware acquisition 
the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from lower compensation  royalties  and travel costs  partially offset by increased internal consulting costs 
compensation expenses decreased by million in fiscal year as a result of a reduction in services and customer support staff 
savings in travel expenses were approximately million 
the purchase of our corporate facilities resulted in a net savings of approximately million 
royalty payments for licensed technologies embedded in our products decreased approximately million primarily due to the mix of products sold during the period and renegotiated agreements with these suppliers 
we periodically deploy consulting engineers for certain sales and marketing activities  the costs for which we then classify as sales and marketing expense 
we utilized fewer engineers on sales and marketing activities  which offset the cost of revenue savings in fiscal year by million 
we expect that cost of revenue will grow in absolute dollars but will remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation  third party contractor fees and related costs associated with the development and enhancement of our suite of products 
year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses  excluding stock based compensation as percent of total revenue the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million decrease in third party contractor fees and a million reduction of facility cost expenses  partially offset by a million increase in personnel compensation 
the reduction in third party contractor fees was largely the result of renegotiated agreements with various third party contractors 
the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june has also contributed to the reduction of facility expenses in fiscal year personnel compensation increased due to an increase in headcount primarily as a result of the staffware acquisition  and an increase in variable incentive compensation 
the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a reduction in the cost of third party contractors of million  lower compensation costs of million  and net savings of approximately million resulting from the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  we expect that spending on research and development will increase slightly in absolute dollars in fiscal year 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs of our direct sales force and marketing staff  the cost of marketing programs  including customer conferences  promotional materials  trade shows and advertising  and related travel expenses 
year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses  excluding stock based compensation as percent of total revenue the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in personnel compensation  a million increase in commission expense and a million increase in travel expenses  partially offset by a million decrease in marketing program costs and million reduction of facility expenses 
the increase in personnel compensation was related to an increase in headcount  most significantly in europe  primarily as a result of the staffware acquisition 
the higher sales commission was a result of higher commissionable revenue 
the reduction in marketing program costs was due to more specific and targeted advertising efforts 
the reduction in facility expenses was attributable to the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june the decrease in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from lower internal consulting  travel  commission and promotion costs and referral payments to our integration partners 
several of our consulting engineers were utilized for sales and marketing activities in fiscal year  which was not repeated in fiscal year  resulting in approximately million of cost savings 
an increased emphasis on internally generated sales resulted in a decrease in referral fees to integration partners of million 
a million decrease in commission expense is mainly attributable to lower commissionable sales 
a decreased level of travel in addition to renegotiated arrangements with travel providers resulted in a savings of approximately million in travel costs 
in addition  promotion costs decreased by approximately million due to more specific and targeted advertising campaigns 
we intend to selectively increase staff in our direct sales organization and to create select product marketing programs and  accordingly  expect that sales and marketing expenditures will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive  legal  finance  accounting and human resources 
year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation as percent of total revenue 
table of contents the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an million increase in personnel compensation  a million increase in consulting and outside services and a million increase in travel expenses  offset by a million reduction in facility expenses  and reductions in other administrative costs 
increased headcount together with an increase in variable incentive compensation contributed to total higher personnel costs 
consulting and outside services increased substantially  due to the sarbanes oxley act sarbanes oxley compliance initiative 
the reduction in facility expenses was attributable to the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june the decrease in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to approximately million in savings from the purchase of our corporate facilities partially offset by increased compensation in the amount of million 
we believe that general and administrative expenses  exclusive of bad debt charges  will remain relatively stable as a percentage of total revenue and will increase slightly in absolute dollars in fiscal year stock based compensation stock based compensation expense principally relates to stock options assumed in acquisitions  stock options granted to consultants and the employer portion of payroll taxes due as a result of employee exercises of stock options 
we account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb see also note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to consultants is recognized as earned using the multiple option method and is recorded by expense category 
at each reporting date  we re value consultant stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
as a result  stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
the employer portion of payroll taxes due as a result of employee exercises of stock options is included as a part of stock based compensation expense in the period the option is exercised 
year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages stock based compensation expense in cost of revenue in operating expenses total stock based compensation as percent of total revenue the decrease in stock based compensation in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year consisted of a million decrease in employee and acquisition related stock based compensation  partially offset by an increase of million in stock based compensation expense related to consultants 
the decrease was mainly the result of continuous amortization of unearned stock based compensation cost brought forward from prior years  with minimal additions in fiscal year the decrease in stock based compensation in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million decrease in employee and acquisition related stock based compensation and a million decrease in employer required payroll taxes for stock option exercises 
as prescribed by sfas r issued in december  we will be required to recognize the compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions in our financial statements  using the fair value method  starting from our fourth fiscal quarter of we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our net income and income per share  and we are currently in the process of evaluating the extent of such impact 

table of contents acquired in process research and development year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages acquired in process research and development expense as percent of total revenue in fiscal years and  we estimated that million and million of the purchase prices of staffware and talarian  respectively  represented acquired in process research and development iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisition 
we calculated the value of iprd by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion 
in determining the value ultimately assigned to iprd we considered the stage of completion  complexity of work to date  difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred and the expected cost to complete the project 
the talarian projects were subsequently completed within management s estimates 
we expect to complete the staffware projects in fiscal year restructuring charge year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages restructuring charges as percent of total revenue during fiscal year we recorded million in additional restructuring charges related to properties vacated in connection with facilities consolidation 
the additional facilities charges resulted from revisions to our estimates of future sublease income due to further deterioration of real estate market conditions 
the estimated facility costs were based on the company s contractual obligations  net of estimated sublease income  based on current comparable rates for leases in their respective markets 
should facilities rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate by up to million 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to a reduction in headcount to further align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
this reduction of approximately employees was comprised of sales and marketing staff  general and administrative staff  and research and development staff 
all severance actions were completed by august  during fiscal year  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million  consisting of million for headcount reductions and million related to the consolidation of facilities 
these restructuring charges were recorded to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
we recorded an additional accrual of million in fiscal for the estimated losses on facilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of talarian as acquisition integration costs  which were included in the purchase price 
since then  we have subleased some of the unoccupied facilities

amortization of acquired intangibles intangible assets amortized to operating expenses are comprised of the estimated value of patents  trademarks  established customer base  and non compete agreements  as well as maintenance and oem customer royalty agreements 
year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages amortization of acquired intangibles as percent of total revenue the increase in amortization of acquired intangibles in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the acquired intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions of staffware and general interface corp 
general interface 
the decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is principally due to the cessation of amortization of goodwill since we adopted sfas on december   which requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives not be amortized but  instead  are subject to impairment charges when tested on at least an annual basis  or when events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
in fiscal year and before  we recognized amortization of goodwill  as well as amortization of other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce was million for fiscal year see also note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents interest income year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages interest income as percent of total revenue the decrease in interest income in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the decline in interest rates on our investments combined with a decrease in our investment asset base as a result of our repurchase and retirement of million of our common stock from reuters  as well as the staffware and general interface acquisition related net outlay of million 
the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to lower average investment account balances as a result of the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june  along with continued declines in interest rates as investments matured and were reinvested in lower interest rate securities 
interest expense year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages interest expense as percent of total revenue interest expense is related to the mortgage note payable for the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june we recorded a million mortgage note payable to a financial institution collateralized by the commercial real property acquired 
the mortgage note payable carries a fixed annual interest rate of and a year amortization 
the principal balance remaining at the end of the year term of million is due as a final balloon payment on july  interest expense increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to the fact that the mortgage note was entered into in june  so interest expense was only for part of the fiscal year  as compared to the entire year for fiscal year 
table of contents other income expenses  net other income expenses  net  includes realized gains and losses on investments  foreign exchange gain loss and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
year ended november  change change in thousands  except percentages foreign exchange gain loss realized gain loss on short term investments realized gain loss on long term investments other income expense  net total other income expense  net as percent of total revenue foreign exchange loss in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the british pound 
realized gain loss on short term investments represents gains or losses realized when such short term investments are sold and when other than temporary impairment on individual securities is recorded 
the decrease in realized gain in short term investments in fiscal year was mainly due to increases in market interest rates 
realized loss on long term investments in fiscal year was primarily due to impairment charges on our private equity investments attributable to the global economic slowdown and reduction in technology spending which negatively impacted the development stage companies in which we had invested 
income taxes management believes that  based on a number of factors  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our us deferred tax assets will not be realized  and accordingly  for the year ended november  we have provided a valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
during each fiscal year  management determines if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly 
our income taxes payable for federal purposes have been reduced by the tax benefits associated with the exercise of employee stock options and utilization of net operating loss carryover applicable to both stock options and acquired entities for fiscal year the benefits applicable to stock options were credited directly to stockholders equity and amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the benefits applicable to acquired entities were credited directly to goodwill and amounted to million and zero for fiscal years and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was  and for the fiscal years ended november   and  respectively 
for fiscal year  the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in the tax benefit from the change in valuation allowance  partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate on foreign sourced income 
as of november   our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were million and million  respectively  which expire through as of november   our federal and state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were million and million  respectively  which expire through

the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before realization 
on october   the american jobs creation act of jobs act was enacted 
among other provisions  the jobs act provides for a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities phased in from to  and a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad 
we do not plan to repatriate foreign earnings under the jobs act and have not yet determined the impact of the deduction for domestic production activities 
such deduction will first be available to the company in fiscal year at this time  we do not expect that the deduction will have a material impact on our reported income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources at november   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  representing an increase of million from november  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million  resulting from net income of million plus non cash charges of million and tax benefits from acquisition and employee stock options of million  less a million net change in assets and liabilities net of acquisitions

net cash used for operating activities in fiscal year was million resulting from our net loss of million being offset by non cash charges of million and a net change in assets and liabilities of million 
to the extent that non cash items increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
after excluding the effects of these non cash charges  the primary changes in cash flows relating to operating activities result from changes in working capital 
our primary source of operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
the provisions of our agreement with reuters which relate to minimum guaranteed fees of million per quarter net of license and maintenance revenue for sales to financial service companies will expire in march however  based upon our experience in selling directly into the financial services market since october and the recent increase in our revenues from other markets  we believe that we will be able to replace or reduce the impact of the cessation of the million per quarter in revenue from reuters after march accordingly  while there can be no assurance  we do not believe that the elimination of guaranteed fees from reuters will have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable 
we generally pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the terms of accounts payable arrangements and management s assessment of our cash inflows 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal year  resulting primarily from net sales of short term investments of million  partially offset by million net cash used for the staffware acquisition and million net cash used for the general interface acquisition

in addition  we are subject to certain non financial covenants as defined in the agreements 
we are in compliance with all covenants as of november  and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future 
in conjunction with the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june  we entered into a year lease of the land upon which our corporate headquarters is located 
the lease was paid in advance for a total of million  but is subject to adjustments every ten years based upon changes in fair market value 
should it become necessary  we have the option to prepay any rent increases due as a result of a change in fair market value

this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first reporting period that begins after june  we currently measure compensation costs related to share based payments under apb  as allowed by sfas  and provide disclosure in notes to financial statements as required by sfas we are required to adopt sfas r starting from the fourth fiscal quarter of we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our net income and income per share

factors that may affect operating results the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in the forward looking statements we make about our business 
our future revenue is unpredictable and we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate  which may cause our stock price to decline 
period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
moreover  our operating results in some years have not in the past  and may not in the future  meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
this has in the past and may in the future cause our stock price to decline 
as a result of our limited operating history and the evolving nature of the markets in which we compete  we have difficulty accurately forecasting our revenue in any given period 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this section  a number of factors may cause our revenue to fall short of our expectations  or those of stock market analysts and investors  or cause fluctuations in our operating results  including the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products or services by our competitors  the relatively long sales cycles for many of our products  the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal quarter or our fiscal year in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms  the timing of our new products or product enhancements or any delays in such introductions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations of our products  changes in customer budgets and decision making process that could affect both the timing and size of any transaction  any difficulty we encounter in integrating acquired businesses  products or technologies  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our operations  and changes in local  national and international regulatory requirements 
in addition  while we may in future years record positive net income and or increases in net income over prior periods  we may not show period over period earnings per share growth or earnings per share growth that meets the expectations of stock market analysts or investors  as a result of increases in the number of our shares outstanding during such periods 
in such case  our stock price may decline 

table of contents recent legislation requires us to undertake an annual evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting icfr that may identify internal control weaknesses requiring remediation  which could harm our reputation 
sarbanes oxley imposes new duties on us  our executives  and directors 
we have recently completed our evaluation of the design  remediation and testing of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required to comply with the management certification and attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm as required by section of sarbanes oxley section 
while our assessment  testing and evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting resulted in our conclusion that as of november   our internal control over financial reporting were effective  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if we are not able to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner  if we conclude in future periods that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective  we may be required to change our icfr to remediate deficiencies  investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  and we may be subject to investigation and or sanctions by regulatory authorities 
also  in the course of our ongoing icfr evaluation  we have identified areas of our icfr requiring improvement and are in the process of designing enhanced processes and controls to address those issues 
as a result  we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management s time  any of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income or increase our net losses 
and  we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective or sufficient for us to issue reports in the future 
any such events could adversely affect our financial results and or the market price of our common stock and our reputation may be harmed 
in addition  our evaluation of our icfr for fiscal year did not include an evaluation of the staffware entities which we recently acquired 
our inclusion of staffware in future assessments will increase the cost and complexity of complying with section and may increase the risks of achieving compliance  particularly since we plan to test our rollout of our enterprise resource planning software system to the staffware entities 
it may be difficult to design and implement effective internal control over financial reporting for such combined operations and differences in existing controls of staffware and other acquired businesses may result in weaknesses that require remediation when the internal control over financial reporting is combined 
the management of our combined operations and growth will require us to improve our operational  financial and management controls  as well as our internal reporting systems and controls 
we may not be able to implement improvements to our icfr in an efficient and timely manner and may be unable to conclude in future periods that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective 
such complications could also harm our reputation with investors 
recently enacted and proposed regulatory changes have caused us to incur increased costs and operating expenses  may limit our ability to obtain director and officer liability insurance and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified officers and directors 
sarbanes oxley and newly proposed or enacted rules of the sec and nasdaq have caused us  and we expect will cause us  to incur significant increased costs in the future as we implement and respond to new requirements 
in this regard  achieving and maintaining compliance with sarbanes oxley and other new rules and regulations  may require us to hire additional personnel and use additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services 
failure to satisfy the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  or as executive officers 

table of contents our financial results may be materially adversely affected by and our business may suffer due to recent changes in the accounting rules governing the recognition of stock based compensation expense 
historically  we have accounted for employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  we recognized stock based compensation for employees of million  million and million  net of taxes  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in accordance with sfas and sfas  we provide additional disclosures of our operating results in the notes to our financial statements as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting 
had we accounted for our stock based compensation expense for employees in our results of operations under the fair value method of accounting prescribed by sfas  the compensation charges would have been significantly higher than the intrinsic value method used by us resulting in a reduction of net income of approximately  million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb sfas r requires compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions to be recognized in financial statements 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first reporting period that begins after june  accordingly  we will be required to adopt sfas r starting in our fourth fiscal quarter of we expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material adverse impact on our net income or loss and our net income or loss per share by decreasing our income or increasing our losses by the additional amount of such stock option charges 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the extent of such impact and cannot quantify the amount of such impact at this time 
in addition  we modified our employee stock purchase program in response to these recent accounting changes such that the duration for offering periods was changed to six months and the price at which the common stock is purchased under the espp was set at of the fair market value of our common stock on the last day of the respective purchase period 
these modifications to the espp are effective as of the purchase period beginning february  since the administrative burden and tax consequences appear to outweigh any benefit that our international employees might receive from participating in the espp  we have also chosen to exclude all non us employees from the espp  on a country by country basis  starting with the purchase period beginning february  such changes to our espp are likely to be deemed a reduction in benefits to both our current and prospective employees  potentially increasing the difficulty in retaining and recruiting quality personnel  which could cause our business to suffer 
we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs associated with our acquisition and integration of staffware  which could have an adverse effect on our share price 
since we completed our acquisition of staffware in the third quarter of fiscal year  we have been integrating many of our operations with those of staffware 
we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs associated with both the acquisition and integration of staffware 
these costs have been substantial and include advisers fees  reorganization or closure of facilities  including lease terminations  severance  employee retention and other employee related costs  costs of meetings  training  re branding and integration of information technology systems and other integration costs 
we also expect to incur costs as a result of international rules and regulations that limit or complicate restructuring plans  such as the eu directive ec amending directive eec on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to the safeguarding of employees rights in the event of transfers of undertakings  businesses or parts of businesses eu directive ec  which requires us to undertake costly and time consuming administrative measures to protect employees rights in connection with our acquisition of staffware 
in addition  our inclusion of staffware in future section assessments will increase the costs and complexity of complying with section the combined entity has incurred and will incur charges to operations  which are not currently reasonably estimable  in the quarters which follow  to reflect costs associated with integrating the two companies 
we also expect to incur charges to earnings for amortization of intangibles acquired in the acquisition 
our financial results  including earnings per share  could be adversely affected by these or any additional future charges to reflect additional costs associated with the acquisition  which could have an adverse effect on the price of tibco shares 

table of contents we have a history of losses and if we are unable to sustain profitability  our business will suffer and our stock price may decline 
we may not be able to achieve revenue or earnings growth or obtain sufficient revenue to sustain profitability 
while we achieved profits of million and million for the fiscal years ended november  and  respectively  we incurred a net loss of million in fiscal year as of november   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have invested significantly in building our sales and marketing organization and in our technology research and development 
we expect to continue to spend financial and other resources on developing and introducing enhancements to our existing and new software products and our direct sales and marketing activities 
as a result  we need to generate significant revenue to maintain profitability 
we also expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material adverse impact on our net income by decreasing our income or possibly causing us to incur a loss due to the resulting amount of stock option charges 
in addition  we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of our resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 
however  we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years 
our strategy contemplates possible future acquisitions which may result in us incurring unanticipated expenses or additional debt  difficulty in integrating our operations  dilution to our stockholders and may harm our operating results 
our success depends in part on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
we have in the past and may in the future  acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
in this regard  we completed our acquisition of staffware in the third quarter of fiscal year and acquired the businesses of general interface corp 
in  talarian corporation in  praja  inc in  extensibility  inc 
in and inconcert  inc in we do not know if we will be able to complete any acquisition or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate it profitably  or retain its key employees 
integrating any newly acquired business  product or technology could be expensive and time consuming  could disrupt our ongoing business and could distract our management 
therefore  we might not be able  either immediately post acquisition or ever  to replicate the pre acquisition revenues achieved by companies that we acquire 
furthermore  the costs of integrating acquired companies in international transactions can be particularly high  due to local laws and regulations  such as the eu directive ec  which are heavily protective of employees rights in the context of a merger 
we may face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources 
in addition  in order to finance any acquisition  we might need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or use our cash reserves 
in that event  we could be forced to obtain equity or debt financing on terms that are not favorable to us and  in the case of equity financing  that may result in dilution to our stockholders 
use of our cash reserves for acquisitions could limit our financial flexibility in the future 
moreover  the terms of existing loan agreements may prohibit certain acquisitions or may place limits on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity securities to finance acquisitions 
if we are unable to integrate any newly acquired entity  products or technology effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results would suffer 
in addition  any amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets  stock based compensation or other charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our operating results 
the past slowdown in the market for infrastructure software and its protracted recovery have caused our revenue to decline in the past and could cause our revenue or results of operations to fall below expectations in the future 
the market for infrastructure software is relatively new and evolving 
we earn a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our infrastructure software  including application integration software and related services 

table of contents we expect to earn substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future from sales of these products and services 
our future financial performance will depend on continued growth in the number of organizations demanding software and services for application integration and information delivery and companies seeking outside vendors to develop  manage and maintain this software for their critical applications 
a recently weak and slowly recovering united states and global economy  which has had a disproportionate impact on information technology spending by businesses  has led to a reduction in sales in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
many of our potential customers have made significant investments in internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to third party products  which may substantially inhibit the growth of the market for infrastructure software 
if the market fails to grow  or grows more slowly than we expect  our sales will be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that as the economy revives and companies make greater investments in information technology and infrastructure software that our revenue will grow at the same pace 
our business is subject to seasonal variations which make quarter to quarter comparisons difficult 
our business is subject to variations throughout the year due to seasonal factors in the us and worldwide 
these factors include fewer selling days in europe during the summer vacation season which has a disproportionate effect on sales in europe  including the impact of the holidays and a slow down in capital expenditures by our customers at calendar year end during our first fiscal quarter 
these factors typically result in lower sales activity in our first and third fiscal quarters compared to the rest of the year and make quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results less meaningful 
the loss of any significant customer could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 
we do not have long term sales contracts with any of our customers 
there can be no assurance that any of our customers  including reuters  will continue to purchase our products in the future 
as a result  a customer that generates substantial revenue for us in one period may not be a source of revenue in subsequent periods 
for example  in each of the first and second quarters of fiscal year  a single customer it telecom spa and pepsico business solutions group  respectively accounted for over of total revenue during such periods  although this did not result in any one customer accounting for over of total revenue for fiscal year overall 
in addition  sales to reuters  our largest customer  accounted for of our total revenue in fiscal year and of our total revenue in fiscal year our guaranteed minimum distribution fees from reuters end in march thereafter  we will need to replace the revenue that we had historically received from reuters with direct sales either to financial services companies or increased sales in other sectors 
any inability on our part to replace the minimum guaranteed revenue from reuters would adversely affect our business and operating results 
our licensing  distribution and maintenance agreement with reuters places certain limitations on our ability to conduct our business and involves various execution risks to our business 
in october  we entered into a new agreement with reuters relating to the licensing  distribution and maintenance of reuters products 
prior to such time  we were restricted from selling our products to customers in the financial services market 
pursuant to the terms of our current agreement with reuters  we are now permitted to market and sell our products  other than risk management and market data distribution products  directly and through third party resellers other than a few specified resellers to customers in the financial services market 
reuters has been and continues to phase out its role as a general reseller of our products through march  at which time reuters distribution rights will terminate 
reuters continues to have a non exclusive right to distribute our products in connection with certain project implementations for a limited number of its existing customers and for pre existing customer leads until march after such time  reuters may continue to internally use and embed our products in its solutions 
consequently  our revenue from the financial services market will be dependent upon our ability to directly market and sell our products in such market or indirectly with resellers other than reuters 

table of contents reuters obligation to pay us minimum guaranteed distribution fees terminates in march after march  we will no longer receive such minimum guaranteed fees and will have to replace such revenue with direct sales either to financial services companies or increased sales in other sectors 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in generating enough revenue from financial services market customers to replace these minimum guaranteed payments after such time 
any inability on our part to replace the minimum guaranteed revenue from reuters would adversely affect our business and operating results 
neither reuters nor any third party reseller or distributor has any contractual obligation to distribute minimum quantities of our products 
reuters and other distributors may choose not to market and sell our products or may elect to sell competitive third party products  either of which may adversely affect our market share and revenue 
reuters has nearly completed its transition of maintenance and support of our products for its customers  as well as the associated revenue  to us since entering into the current agreement 
as a result  we have been providing maintenance and support services directly to customers transitioned from reuters since the fourth quarter of fiscal year if our support organization experiences an unexpected burden as a result of this transition  we may be unable to provide maintenance and support services in accordance with our current plans or customer expectations  which could have a negative impact on our customer relationships 
while we have no current plans to significantly expand our support organization  we may be compelled to do so to maintain these customer relationships 
moreover  we expect service and maintenance revenue and associated costs to increase as a result of our assumption of reuters contracts and the development of our direct sales organization for the financial services market through at least fiscal year to the extent  as a result of our increased service and maintenance obligations  our cost of revenue increases faster than our service and maintenance revenue  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
under our current agreement with reuters  we are no longer prohibited from selling our products and providing consulting services directly to companies in the financial services market  however we are restricted from directly selling and reselling through certain specified resellers  risk management and market data distribution products in such markets until may while we currently do not offer any risk management and market data distribution solutions as part of our product offerings  if we were to develop any such products  we would have to rely on reuters to sell those products in the financial services market until these restrictions end 
reuters is not required to help us sell any of these products in those markets and there can be no assurance that reuters would choose to sell our products over our competitors products 
our license agreement with reuters also imposes certain practical restrictions on our ability to acquire companies in certain business segments 
the license agreement places no specific restrictions on our ability to acquire companies with less than half of their business in the sale of risk management and market data distribution products into the financial services market and to continue such business 
however  under the terms of the license agreement  if we acquire companies which derive more than half of their revenue from the sale of risk management and market data distribution products into the financial services market  or if we combine our technology with any acquired company s risk management or market data distribution products and services for the financial services market  then the acquired company s risk management or market data distribution solutions would become subject to our restrictions on selling risk management and market data distribution solutions to the financial services market until may this prohibition could prevent us from realizing potential synergies with companies we acquire or from pursuing acquisitions that could benefit our business 
any failure by us to meet the requirements of current or newly targeted customers may have a detrimental impact on our business or operating results 
if we fail to meet the expectations or product and service requirements of our current customers  our reputation and business may be harmed 
in addition  we may wish to expand our customer base into markets in which we have limited experience 
in some cases  customers in different markets  such as financial services or 
table of contents government  have specific regulatory or other requirements which we must meet 
for example  in order to maintain contracts with the us government  we must comply with specific rules and regulations relating to and that govern such contracts 
if we fail to meet such requirements  we could be subject to civil or criminal liability or a reduction of revenue which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
any losses we incur as a result of our exposure to the credit risk of our customers could harm our results of operations 
most of our licenses are on an open credit basis 
we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements  seek to limit credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay  and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts 
because of the recent slowdown and slow recovery in the global economy  our exposure to credit risks has increased 
although these losses have not been material to date  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price may be volatile  which could cause investors to lose all or part of their investments in our stock or negatively impact the effectiveness of our equity incentive plans 
the stock market in general and the stock prices of technology companies in particular  have experienced volatility which has often been unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company or companies 
during fiscal year  for example  our stock price fluctuated between a high of and a low of 
if market or industry based fluctuations continue  our stock price could decline in the future regardless of our actual operating performance and investors could lose all or part of their investments 
in addition  we have historically used equity incentive programs  such as employee stock options and stock purchase plans  as a substantial part of overall employee compensation arrangements 
continued stock price volatility may negatively impact the value of such equity incentives  thereby diminishing the value of such incentive programs to employees and decreasing the effectiveness of such programs as retention tools 
we have in the past incurred significant expenses in both hiring new employees and reducing our headcount in response to changing market conditions  and the volatile nature of our industry makes it likely that we will continue to expend significant resources in managing our operations 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we have increased the scope of our operations both domestically and internationally 
we must successfully integrate new employees into our operations and generate sufficient revenues to justify the costs associated with these employees 
if we fail to successfully integrate employees or to generate the revenue necessary to offset employee related expenses  we may be forced to reduce our headcount  which would force us to incur significant expenses and would harm our business and operating results 
for example  in response to changing market conditions  in fiscal year  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million  comprised of million related to abandoned and other facilities and million related to a reduction of our headcount by approximately employees 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million restructuring charge related to a reduction in headcount  and in fiscal year  we recorded a million restructuring charge resulting from revisions to our estimates of future sublease income due to a deterioration of real estate market conditions 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures and continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties 
failure to control costs in any of the foregoing areas efficiently and effectively could interfere with the growth of our business as a whole 
if we do not retain our key management personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees  we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 
if we fail to retain and recruit key management and other skilled employees  our business and our ability to obtain new customers  develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer 
the 
table of contents success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel  including vivek ranadiv  our president and chief executive officer 
the loss of one or more key employees could adversely affect our continued operations 
we have experienced changes in our management organization over the past several years and may experience additional management changes in the future 
in this regard  certain members of our senior management team terminated their employment with us in fiscal year uncertainty created by turnover of key employees could also result in reduced confidence in our financial performance which could cause fluctuations in our stock price and result in further turnover of our employees 
our success also depends on our ability to recruit  retain and motivate highly skilled sales  marketing and engineering personnel 
competition for these people in the software industries is intense  and we may not be able to successfully recruit  train or retain qualified personnel 
in addition  we have in the past and may in the future experienced turnover in our marketing and sales management 
in particular  members of the staffware sales force may leave as a result of our acquisition of staffware  negatively impacting our ability to realize the synergies we expect from the combination of our business with that of staffware 
our business may be harmed if reuters uses the technology we license from it to compete with us or grants licenses to such technology to others who use it to compete with us 
we license from reuters the intellectual property that was incorporated into early versions of some of our software products 
we do not own this licensed technology 
because reuters has access to intellectual property used in our products  it could use this intellectual property to compete with us 
reuters is not restricted from using the licensed technology it has licensed to us to produce products that compete with our products  and it can grant limited licenses to the licensed technology to others who may compete with us 
in addition  we must license to reuters all of the products  and the source code for certain products  we create through december this may place reuters in a position to more easily develop products that compete with ours 
our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 
we cannot be certain that our products do not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states and many other countries are not publicly disclosed until a patent is issued  applications covering technology used in our software products may have been filed without our knowledge 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time  including claims of alleged infringement of the patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert our management s attention away from running our business and seriously harm our business 
if we were to discover that our products violated the intellectual property rights of others  we would have to obtain licenses from these parties in order to continue marketing our products without substantial reengineering 
we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all  and if we could not obtain such licenses  we might not be able to reengineer our products successfully or in a timely fashion 
if we fail to address any infringement issues successfully  we would be forced to incur significant costs  including damages and potentially satisfying indemnification obligations that we have with our customers  and we could be prevented from selling certain of our products 
our intellectual property or proprietary rights could be misappropriated  which could force us to become involved in expensive and time consuming litigation 
we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets  patents licensed or others and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
any misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our proprietary information as do the laws of the united states 
if our proprietary information were misappropriated  we might have to engage in litigation to protect it 
we might 
table of contents not succeed in protecting our proprietary information if we initiate intellectual property litigation  and  in any event  such litigation would be expensive and time consuming  could divert our management s attention away from running our business and could seriously harm our business 
we must overcome significant competition in order to succeed 
the market for our products and services is extremely competitive and subject to rapid change 
we compete with various providers of enterprise application integration solutions  including webmethods and seebeyond 
we also compete with various providers of web services such as microsoft  bea  sap and ibm 
we believe that of these companies  ibm has the potential to offer the most complete competitive set of products for enterprise application integration 
as a result of our acquisition of staffware in the third quarter of fiscal year  we now also compete with various providers of bpm solutions 
we also face competition for certain aspects of our product and service offerings from major systems integrators 
we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources  greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we do 
our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer  adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies  evolving industry trends or customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
accordingly  we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets or competition may intensify and harm our business and operating results 
if we are not successful in developing enhancements to existing products and new products in a timely manner  achieving customer acceptance or generating higher average selling prices  our gross margins may decline  and our business and operating results may suffer 
market acceptance of new platforms and web services standards may require us to undergo the expense of developing and maintaining compatible product lines 
our software products can be licensed for use with a variety of platforms 
there may be future or existing platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace which may not be architecturally compatible with our software products 
in addition  the effort and expense of developing  testing and maintaining software products will increase as more platforms achieve market acceptance within our target markets 
moreover  future or existing user interfaces that achieve popularity within the enterprise application integration marketplace may not be compatible with our current software products 
if we are unable to achieve market acceptance of our software products or adapt to new platforms  our sales and revenues will be adversely affected 
developing and maintaining different software products could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules  which could harm our revenue and financial condition 
if we are not able to develop software for accepted platforms or fail to adopt webservices standards  our license and service revenues and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
in addition  if the platforms we have developed software for are not accepted  our license and service revenues and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
the outcome of litigation pending against us could require us to expend significant resources and could harm our business and financial resources 
we  certain of our directors and officers and certain investment bank underwriters have been named in a putative class action for violation of the federal securities laws in the us district court for the southern district of new york  captioned in re tibco software inc initial public offering securities litigation 
this is one of a number of cases challenging underwriting practices in the initial public offerings of more than companies  which have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as in re initial public offering securities litigation 
plaintiffs generally allege that the underwriters engaged in undisclosed and improper underwriting activities  namely the receipt of excessive brokerage commissions and customer agreements regarding post offering 
table of contents purchases of stock in exchange for allocations of ipo shares 
plaintiffs also allege that various investment bank securities analysts issued false and misleading analyst reports 
the complaint against us claims that the purported improper underwriting activities were not disclosed in the registration statements for our ipo and secondary public offering and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased our securities or sold put options during the time period from july  to december  a lawsuit with similar allegations of undisclosed improper underwriting practices  and part of the same coordinated proceedings  is pending against talarian  which we acquired in that action is captioned in re talarian corp 
initial public offering securities litigation 
the complaint against talarian  certain of its underwriters  and certain of its former directors and officers claims that the purported improper underwriting activities were not disclosed in the registration statement for talarian s ipo and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased talarian securities during the time period from july  to december  a stipulation of settlement for the claims against the issuer defendants  including the company and talarian  has been submitted to the court for preliminary approval 
under the settlement  the plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against participating defendants in exchange for a contingent payment guaranty by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in the action  and the assignment or surrender to the plaintiffs of certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters 
under the guaranty  the insurers will be required to pay an amount equal to billion less any amounts ultimately collected by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants in all the cases 
unlike most of the defendant issuers insurance policies  including ours  talarian s policy contains a specific self insured retention in the amount of million for ipo laddering claims  including those alleged in this matter 
thus  under the proposed settlement  if any payment is required under the insurers guaranty  our subsidiary  talarian  would be responsible for paying its pro rata share of the shortfall  up to million of the self insured retention remaining under its policy 
the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could harm our business  financial condition and reputation 
the defense of the lawsuits could result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments with respect to the lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of the lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  any such payment could seriously harm our financial condition and liquidity 
natural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses 
natural disasters and other business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
our corporate headquarters and many of our operations are located in california  a seismically active region 
a natural disaster  such as the recent tsunami in asia  or other unanticipated business disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition both in the united states and abroad 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as a stockholder rights plan  may have anti takeover effects 
in february  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock 
each right  when exercisable  entitles the registered holder to purchase certain securities at a specified purchase price 
the rights plan may have the anti takeover effect of causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire tibco on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the existence of the rights plan could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable 
in addition  provisions of our current 
table of contents certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware corporate law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the support of our board of directors  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the maximum allowable duration of a single issue is years and the maximum allowable duration of the portfolio is years 
at the end of fiscal years  and  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities totaling million  million and million  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds  respectively 
our investments consist primarily of bank and finance notes  various government obligations and asset backed securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses are charged against income when a decline in fair market value is determined to be other than temporary 
the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold 
the investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value in the event market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of november   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
we develop products in the united states and sell in north america  south america  europe  the pacific rim and the middle east 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a majority of sales are currently made in us dollars  however  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we enter into forward contracts to manage exposure related to accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately million  million and million at november   and  respectively 
the open contracts at november  mature at various dates through january and are cashflow hedges of certain foreign currency transaction exposures in various currencies including the euro  singapore dollar  swedish krona  swiss francs  canadian dollar  japanese yen  british pound and australian dollar 
the fair value of these forward contracts at november  was approximately million 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of november  and  measuring the change in fair value arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates vis vis the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers all of our foreign currency contracts offset by underlying exposures 
we used foreign currency exchange rates based on market rates in effect at november  and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments  net of exposures  of million at november  and million at november
