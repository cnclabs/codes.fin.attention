critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions  some of which are subjective and complex  that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial position of the company revenue recognition sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes 
management records rebate costs based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained 
the company also establishes product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue associated with tooling and other engineering service agreements is recognized as services are performed in relation to management s estimate of the total costs to be incurred on the agreement 
for agreements with multiple deliverables  the company assesses whether more than one unit of accounting exists 
if more than one unit exists  revenue for each separate unit is recorded as earned 
impairment of assets the company reviews goodwill and long lived assets principally property  plant and equipment and patents annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs 
the company has determined its reporting units to be the americas  europe asia and device group divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment 
for assets held and used in the business  management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit 
for assets held for sale  management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset  less costs to sell 
changes in management s estimate of fair value  including management s estimate of future cash flows  could have a material impact on the company s future results of operations and financial position 
employee benefits the measurement of the obligations under the company s defined benefit pension and post retirement medical plans are subject to a number of assumptions 
these include the rate of return on plan assets and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to present value 
for us plans  which account for over of global plan assets  the long term rate of return assumption remained at 
this return assumption was determined by reviewing the expected mix of plan assets approximately equity and debt securities and the projected return over a year period 
the discount rate was reduced basis points to on december   to reflect current market conditions 
changes in these estimates  including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial assumptions  could have a material impact on the company s future results of operations and financial position 
every basis point reduction in the long term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by approximately million 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million 
in addition  restructuring events such as plant closures or changes in pension plan provisions could result in curtailment or settlement of pension plan obligations  which would result in gain or loss recognition in the period when such an event occurs 
stock based compensation the company currently accounts for employee stock options and other stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
according to the intrinsic value method  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the date of the option grant over the exercise price

as permitted under statement of financial accounting standard share based payment fas  the company discloses the impact of applying a fair value approach to measure stock option expense in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included within item of this report 
in december  the financial accounting standards board revised fas the revised statement prohibits the use of the intrinsic value method and requires the use of a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
the requirements of the revised fas standard are mandatory for interim reporting periods beginning after june  the company plans to adopt the statement early on january  using the modified prospective method 
under this method  stock based employee compensation cost will be recognized for all new awards granted after january  additionally  compensation costs for unvested stock options and awards that are outstanding at january  will be recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of those options and awards as previously calculated under the pro forma disclosures under fas management expects the compensation expense associated with stock options and employee stock purchase programs to impact full year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately

the company will be required to allocate tax expense to repatriating distributions under the act in its quarterly and annual financial statements 
the act s percent exclusion of qualifying dividends reduces the us federal statutory rate to of distributions
