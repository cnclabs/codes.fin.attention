item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide an array of proprietary  value added products to a diverse customer base covering a broad spectrum of industries 
this strategic diversification means that demand for our products depends  in part  upon a wide range of general economic conditions  which affect our markets in varying ways from year to year 
during  the company was favorably impacted as the manufacturing economy continued to emerge from the slowdown of the timeframe 
the general economic rebound and continued significant military and defense spending meant that during the year the company experienced strong demand from various markets including specialty electronic manufacturing equipment  industrial  marine equipment  heavy equipment  material handling and automation equipment  military aerospace  and ordnance markets 
as a result of these positive factors  for the second straight year the company achieved increases in customer order levels in each quarter during compared to the prior year 
the total order book for was million  a percent increase over the total order book for was million  a percent increase over the company continues to focus on programs intended to reduce costs  improve capacity utilization  increase efficiencies  and grow market share and cash flow  thereby positioning the company to capitalize on future opportunities in targeted end markets  especially during a period of sustained economic growth 
during  the company continued a company wide six sigma effort and continued its investments in lean manufacturing and information systems to strengthen the company s operational excellence 
maintaining the company s strong balance sheet and financial flexibility remains a key strategy of the company 
in may  the company issued million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due in july  the company negotiated a million revolving credit agreement 
in january  the company filed a million universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s current cash balances  the million revolving credit facility and other available financial resources enhance liquidity and provide additional financial strength to support the company s objectives  including strategic acquisitions 
during the third quarter of  we completed a small product line acquisition in our velocity control products reporting segment for million  and in early january we acquired purafil  inc  a manufacturer and distributor of gas phase air filtration systems and media for million 
on a reportable segment basis  purafil s results will be reported in other 
in total  during we incurred million of expenses related to various acquisition initiatives 
as previously disclosed  the transactions lawsuit  which dated back to  was concluded during  with a favorable outcome for the company  as the case was dismissed in its entirety against all defendants 
this litigation was extremely time consuming  distracting and costly  involving hundreds of hours of management s time and resulting in legal costs and other expenditures of almost million over its life 
as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report  the company has concluded that its system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  our independent registered public accounting firm s report on internal control over financial reporting is included in item under the heading report of independent registered public accounting firm internal control 
expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance equaled million in the requirements of sarbanes oxley are ongoing  and we will incur additional compliance related costs in the future in our efforts to remain compliant 
in summary  the company would expect to continue to benefit from a favorable manufacturing economy  continued strong military and defense spending  relatively low inflation and interest rates  the company s cost reduction and capacity utilization efforts  and the utilization of current liquidity levels in completing strategic acquisitions 
however  because many of these factors are external to the company  it is difficult to predict the specific impact they may have on the company s operating results 
the discussion which follows should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report to assist in understanding the company s results of operations  its financial position  cash flows  capital structure and other relevant financial information

specifically  the friction and motion control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million or percent compared to sales of million 
the increase is the result of increased sales of custom engineered bearings to the specialty electronics manufacturing equipment market of million  the machinery market of million and the heavy equipment market of million 
these increases were partially offset by reduced sales to specialty ball markets of million 
our velocity control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million 
increased worldwide product demand from a variety of industrial markets contributed to million of the increase  while favorable foreign currency translation  primarily related to the strengthening of the euro  accounted for another million of the increase 
also  a small product line acquisition in the third quarter of contributed million to the sales increase 
our sealing products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  down million  or percent from sales of million  primarily as a result of a work stoppage at the company s baltimore maryland facility  which began on december  and was settled on january  the company s power and data transmission products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million 
increased demand for electronic rotary products and specialty slip ring products used in the offshore oil and gas production  industrial  aerospace  and certain security equipment markets resulted in increased sales of million  while favorable foreign currency translation accounted for another million of the increase 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of these products to certain military markets of million  as competitive dynamics in those markets changed 
our other businesses achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million  due primarily to higher sales prices on metal alloys caused by a pass through of higher raw material prices 
our gross profit equaled million or percent of sales in  as compared to million or percent of sales achieved in gross profit was positively impacted by increased sales  favorable product mix  inventory revaluations and six sigma cost reduction initiatives 
many of our products are high value added and have strong contribution margins  which causes our profit performance to be sensitive to sales volume and mix 
as previously reported  the gross profit includes a million favorable impact related to the settlement of a legal matter 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million or percent of sales in  compared to million or percent of sales for generally  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in as a result of higher sales volume 
in addition  expenses in related to sarbanes oxley compliance increased million compared to  while costs related to acquisition initiatives in increased million compared to also included in selling  general and administrative expenses for is a million pre tax  non cash goodwill impairment loss 
during the second quarter of  we determined that the fair value of one of our reporting units had been reduced to an amount less than the reporting unit s carrying amount 
a change in competitive dynamics resulted in a reduction of this reporting unit s fair value 
as calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets there is no implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
therefore  during the second quarter of  the company incurred a million pre tax  non cash goodwill impairment loss 
partially offsetting this loss  was the million favorable impact of reducing our previously recorded transactions lawsuit legal fee accrual when this case was concluded during 
table of contents the second quarter of during  the company sold a building for million  net of closing costs  and recorded a gain on sale of million reported as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  during the company reduced its product liability accrual by million  favorably impacting selling  general and administrative expenses 
our results were favorably affected by approximately million  net  as a result of two additional items 
first  based on the most recent information from our environmental consultants  we reduced our environmental reserves by million  to the current estimated exposure of million 
this favorable impact was partially offset by the effects of a work stoppage at the company s baltimore  maryland facility  which began on december   and which was settled on january  operating income equaled million during  compared to million in  with operating margins of percent and percent in and on a reporting segment basis  operating income from the friction and motion control products reporting segment was million during as compared to million during the increase is the result of increased sales of custom engineered bearings to the specialty electronics manufacturing equipment  machinery and heavy equipment markets 
operating income was also favorably impacted by the previously reported restructuring plan that was fully implemented during the restructuring plan has reduced labor costs primarily as a result of the relocation of manufacturing to lower cost locales and lower headcount 
operating income for included million of the aforementioned favorable adjustments related to the settlement of a legal matter and the gain on the sale of a building 
the velocity control products reporting segment contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during increases in operating income were primarily due to increased worldwide product demand from a variety of industrial markets and favorable foreign currency translation  primarily related to the strengthening of the euro  which accounted for million of the increase 
the sealing products reporting segment contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during operating income was positively impacted by improved operating efficiencies that offset the negative impact of the work stoppage that began on december   and which has since been settled 
the power and data transmission products reporting segment contributed 
million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during operating income was negatively impacted by unfavorable sales mix  particularly a decrease in sales to certain military markets 
our other businesses contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during the reduction is primarily the result of a million goodwill impairment loss recognized in  partially offset by increased sales due primarily to higher prices on metal alloys caused by the pass through of higher raw material prices 
changes in exchange rates applicable to non functional currency assets and liabilities resulted in exchange gains of million during and million in in may  we issued million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
net interest expense during was million as compared to net interest expense reported during of million 
amortization of note issuance costs is recorded as a component of net interest expense 
the company would expect approximately million of interest and amortization of note issuance costs to be charged to interest expense related to the notes during primarily as a result of higher foreign taxes  the effective income tax rate was percent in  compared with percent in we expect the effective tax rate for to be approximately percent 
as was previously disclosed  beginning with the fourth quarter of  kaydon s diluted earnings per common share calculations reflect the provisions of the final consensus of the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf  the effects of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  which states that the impact of contingently convertible instruments that are convertible into common stock upon the achievement of a specified market price of the issuer s shares  such as the company s contingent convertible senior subordinated notes  should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of 
table of contents whether or not the market price trigger has been met 
the notes are convertible into kaydon common stock once the common stock has traded above for a period of time market price trigger 
the impact of adopting the new accounting rule is a reduction in diluted earnings per common share  but not a reduction in net income 
our net income for was million or per common share on a diluted basis  compared with net income for of million or 
the diluted earnings per share figure  previously reported as  has been restated in accordance with eitf return on sales equaled percent in both and analysis of operations compared to operations selected data for the year compared with the year for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross profit gross profit margin selling  general and administrative expenses litigation related charge operating income operating margin interest income interest expense income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net income earnings per share diluted figure restated for effect of eitf net sales of million in increased million or percent compared to s net sales of million 
specifically  the friction and motion control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million or percent compared to sales of million 
increased sales of custom engineered bearings to defense and military markets of million were partially offset by reduced sales to specialty ball markets of million 
our velocity control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million 
increased product demand from a variety of industrial markets and a percent price increase implemented in april contributed to million of the increase  while favorable foreign currency translation  primarily related to the strengthening of the euro  accounted for another million of the increase 
our sealing products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million  primarily as a result of increased demand from defense markets 
our power and data transmission products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  down million  or percent from sales of million 
lower sales to manufacturers of security scanning equipment of million  was partially offset by increased sales to military  defense  and certain marine markets 
our other businesses achieved sales of million during  down million  or percent from sales of million  due primarily to lower shipments of presses and dies to china as a result of reduced business activity and marketing efforts caused by the sars outbreak 
our gross margin percentage equaled percent in  as compared to percent achieved in the gross profit includes a million favorable impact related to the settlement of a legal matter 
as previously reported  the company  the company s insurance provider and the plaintiff agreed to a settlement of a product liability lawsuit  with the settlement payment to the plaintiff being shared between the company and the company s insurance provider 
the company believed that the majority of its portion of the settlement payment  which equaled million  was covered under the company s commercial general liability policy  and  therefore  filed a legal claim in august in an attempt to recover million from the company s insurance provider 
subsequently  the company s insurance provider filed a counterclaim in an attempt to recover its portion of the settlement payment  million  from the company 
because of the uncertainties involved  and based on a demand from the company s insurance provider to settle this case out of court  the company recorded a million charge to cost of sales and a corresponding credit to other accrued expenses during december throughout and most of there was very little activity in this case 
on december   the court granted the company s motion for summary judgment  and after the company s insurance provider filed a notice of appeal from the court s decision  the company and the 
table of contents company s insurance provider agreed to settle the case for million  which the company s insurance provider paid to the company in january the company has recorded the million settlement amount  as well as the reversal of the million accrual recorded in  a total of million  as a credit to cost of sales  favorably impacting gross margin percentage for the year ended december  in addition  adjustments to inventory reserves related to slow moving and obsolete items were more unfavorable by approximately million during as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million or percent of sales in  compared to million or percent of sales for during the third quarter of  we classified certain land and building assets that were in the process of being sold as assets held for sale as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these assets  a warehousing facility in the company s friction and motion control products reporting segment  were valued at their carrying amount of million 
the opportunity to sell these assets arose due to the facility transferring its inventory to third party warehousing locations in various geographic areas to provide better logistical support to customers 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold the assets held for sale for approximately million  net of closing costs  and recorded a gain on sale of million reported as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
in addition  during and january of we settled certain product liability claims for approximately million  which was less than what had been estimated at the end of as a result  during the fourth quarter of we reduced our product liability accrual by million favorably impacting selling  general and administrative expenses 
also  during  we substantially completed our restructuring plan that began in late to enhance operating performance and balance manufacturing utilization in the specialty bearings products group  part of the friction and motion control products reporting segment 
this restructuring plan resulted in charges  included in selling  general and administrative expenses  of million in and million in both gross profit margin and selling  general  and administrative expenses were equally affected during the year by increased insurance and employment related costs  sarbanes oxley compliance  and the company wide six sigma implementation 
these costs negatively impacted by approximately million compared to during the second quarter of  a million provision was recorded in order to support the company s then most current and best estimate of the cost to continue to litigate the transactions lawsuit 
the change in the estimate during the second quarter resulted from spending levels and new information provided by the company s outside attorneys regarding forecasted spending levels to complete the trial phase 
this legal action is further discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements note and other discussions throughout this annual report 
operating income equaled million during  compared to million in  with operating margins of percent and percent in and on a reporting segment basis  operating income from the friction and motion control products reporting segment was million during as compared to million during operating income in includes million of the aforementioned favorable adjustments related to the settlement of a legal matter and the gain on the sale of a building 
operating income was positively impacted by increased sales volumes and reduced inventory reserve expenses related to slow moving and obsolete items  partially offset by increased insurance and employment related costs 
the velocity control products reporting segment contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during increases in operating income were primarily due to increased product demand  a percent price increase implemented in april  and favorable foreign currency translation  primarily related to the strengthening of the euro  which accounted for million of the increase 
the sealing products reporting segment contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during increases in operating income were primarily due to increased sales volumes and reduced inventory reserve expenses related to slow moving and obsolete items  partially offset by increased insurance and employment related costs 
the power and data transmission products reporting segment contributed million to our 
table of contents consolidated operating income during as compared to million during one business unit within this segment underwent significant changes in its customers and product offerings during  resulting in reduced operating income of million as compared to sales by this business unit to manufacturers of security scanning equipment decreased by million in compared to as a result of the completion in early of sales related to homeland security programs  which was only partially offset during the year by increased demand from military and defense markets 
corrective actions implemented at this business unit  as it adapted to lower volume levels  and a changing mix of commercial and defense products  included headcount reductions of approximately percent  focus on increased efficiencies and overhead reductions  and the launch of a new enterprise resource planning system 
our other businesses contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during reductions in operating income are primarily due to lower sales volumes and higher raw material costs for metal alloys 
changes in exchange rates applicable to non functional currency assets and liabilities resulted in exchange gains of million during and million in in may  the company issued million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
net proceeds received from the notes were million 
the company used million of the net proceeds to repay the full amount outstanding on the company s million revolving credit facility  which was then cancelled 
net proceeds were also used to repurchase million shares of company common stock for million  concurrent with the offering of the notes 
the remaining proceeds of million are being utilized for general corporate purposes 
net interest expense during was million as compared to net interest income reported during of million 
when comparing with  interest expense on the notes of million and amortization of note issuance costs of million was partially offset by million of reduced interest expense on our outstanding bank debt that was retired in connection with the issuance of the notes  and by million of interest income on the additional cash balances which resulted from the issuance of the notes 
amortization of note issuance costs is recorded as a component of net interest expense 
the effective income tax rate was percent in and percent in income before cumulative effect of accounting change equaled million during  compared to million in  with return on sales of percent and percent in and on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  as of january   we are no longer amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  but we perform an annual impairment analysis 
during the second quarter of  we compared the fair value of our reporting units  with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
as required by sfas no 
 the comparison was done as of january  fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
as a result  we identified two reporting units whose carrying amount exceeded their fair value  which indicated potential goodwill impairment 
for purposes of reporting segment information  both reporting units are included in other 
the aggregate total carrying amount of goodwill at these two reporting units was million as of january  during the third quarter of  we engaged a valuation specialist who assisted us in determining that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the two aforementioned reporting units equaled million 
therefore  under sfas no 
 we incurred a pre tax  non cash goodwill impairment loss of million as of january  the two reporting units are expected to generate positive future cash flows  but under the provisions of sfas no 
the present values of those cash flows reporting unit fair value resulted in the implied fair value of goodwill being significantly less than the carrying amount 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the million goodwill impairment loss million or per share on an after tax  diluted basis was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  our net income for was million or per common share on a diluted basis  compared with net income for of million or 
the diluted earnings per share 
table of contents figure  previously reported as  has been restated in accordance with eitf liquidity  working capital  and cash flows one of our financial strategies is to maintain a high level of liquidity and cash flow  which continued in historically  we have generated significant cash flows from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  dividends and other operating requirements 
cash flow generation has been enhanced by our continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies  cost reductions and the management of working capital requirements 
one of our strengths is our ability to generate cash from operations in excess of requirements for capital investments and dividends

the notes bear interest at percent per year  payable semi annually  and under certain circumstances beginning in  may bear additional contingent interest of percent per year 
the notes are convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  provided certain contingencies are met including that our common stock has traded above for out of trading days for specified periods of time 
the conversion price represents a percent premium based on the closing price of per share for the common stock on may  the notes may not be redeemed by us until may  but are redeemable at any time thereafter at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders of the notes will have the option to require us to purchase their notes at par for one day each at the end of   and years after issuance 
in addition  the holders have the right to require redemption of the notes before the specified maturity dates in the event of a change of control of the company  as identified in the notes indenture 
in addition  the contingent interest feature of the notes requires us to deduct for tax purposes an amount of interest expense that is greater than the stated coupon rate on the notes 
the deductibility for tax purposes of the additional interest beyond the stated coupon rate may have to be recaptured  in part or in whole  if the notes are redeemed for cash instead of converted into our common stock

the transactions lawsuit sought damages alleged by plaintiffs to be an amount of million  plus interest and punitive damages against the defendants collectively 
during the second quarter of  a million provision was recorded in order to support our most current and best estimate of the cost to continue to litigate the transactions lawsuit 
in april  the court of appeals issued its summary order affirming in all respects an earlier judgment of the district court  which granted the motion for summary judgment  dismissing the case in its entirety against all defendants 
when the chances of this ruling being further appealed by the plaintiffs became remote  we reduced our previously recorded transactions lawsuit legal fee accrual by million in the second quarter financial statements 
this change in estimate increased second quarter net income by million 
the deadline for the plaintiffs to take action to prolong the case has expired  therefore  the case has concluded

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from the current estimates made by the company 
we have identified certain accounting policies and estimates  described below  that are the most critical to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
loss contingencies and legal costs we record loss contingencies as a liability when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
estimated legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with loss contingencies are accrued in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the accounting estimates related to loss contingencies and legal costs to be critical 
table of contents accounting estimates as contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods and estimation of probable losses and costs to litigate requires forecasts that often depend on judgments from third party experts and are based on potential actions by other third parties such as plaintiffs  juries  and regulators 
to better understand this accounting policy and its historic impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding loss contingencies and legal costs 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a need  tests the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we identify impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
the fair value of each of our reporting units is derived from an estimate of future discounted cash flows including an estimate for terminal value 
we utilize a percent discount rate  and a growth assumption of percent in perpetuity to calculate terminal value 
potential goodwill impairment is identified if a reporting unit s carrying amount is more than a reporting unit s fair value 
if this occurs  normally a third party valuation specialist is utilized to assist the company in determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the amount of any actual impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
trademarks are the company s only indefinite lived intangible assets 
we identify impairment of these trademarks by comparing their fair value to their carrying amounts 
the fair value of the trademarks are calculated based on estimates of discounted future cash flows including an estimates for terminal values related to the net amount of royalty expenses avoided due to the existence of the trademarks 
we believe the accounting estimates related to impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of discounted future cash flows and terminal values  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary  and the calculation of implied fair value is inherently subject to estimates 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived assets including fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets may warrant revision or that remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the long lived assets that are compared to the carrying value of the asset to evaluate whether the asset costs are recoverable 
we believe the accounting estimates related to long lived asset impairment to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  and projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note in this annual report for additional information regarding long lived assets 
retirement benefits our employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations recorded in the financial statements are dependent on the company s estimates provided to and used by our actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we believe the accounting estimates related to retirement benefits to be critical accounting estimates because of the wide range of assumptions used in deriving yearly contribution and expense amounts as well as the amounts recorded for retirement benefits in our financial statements 
significant assumptions include judgments regarding discount rates  health care cost 
table of contents trend rates  inflation rates  salary growth rates  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
we have developed estimates based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
discount rate assumptions are based on investment yields available on long term bonds 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical data  the near term outlook  and on an assessment of likely long term trends 
inflation assumptions are based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
salary growth assumptions reflect our long term experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
long term return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of historical and expected returns of the individual asset classes comprising the total plan assets 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience and mortality tables 
the following table summarizes certain of the company s assumptions postretirement pension benefits benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected long term return on plan assets n a n a rate of compensation increase actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
to better understand this accounting policy and its historic impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding costs  obligations  and assumptions for employee pension and postretirement benefits 
contingent convertible senior subordinated notes in may of  we completed the sale of million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  provided certain contingencies are met including that our common stock has traded above for out of trading days for specified periods of time 
in october  the financial accounting standards board ratified the final consensus of the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf  the effects of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  which states that the impact of contingently convertible instruments that are convertible into common stock upon the achievement of a specified market price of the issuer s shares  such as the company s notes  should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether or not the market price trigger has been met 
the provisions are effective for reporting periods ending after december  accordingly  beginning with the second quarter of  prior period diluted earnings per share amounts have been restated to adjust net income by adding back the after tax interest expense  including amortization of debt issuance costs  attributable to the notes and to increase total shares outstanding by the number of shares that would be issuable upon conversion 
in addition  the contingent interest feature of the notes requires the company to deduct for tax purposes an amount of interest expense that is greater than the stated coupon rate on the notes 
the deductibility for tax purposes of the additional interest beyond the stated coupon rate may have to be recaptured  in part or in whole  if the notes are redeemed for cash instead of converted into company common stock 
should this happen  depending on other factors  tax payments may increase 

table of contents we believe that the impact the notes have on the accounting for our diluted earnings per share calculations  and tax related account balances as discussed above are critical to the understanding of our current financial condition and results of operations 
application of eitf has caused further dilution to our diluted earnings per share calculation  and redemption of the notes for cash may cause volatility in tax payments  cash flows and the liquidity of the company 
to better understand the notes and their impact on the company s financial reporting  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note and other discussions in this annual report 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed for recoverability by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
income tax is provided based upon an effective tax rate that is dependent upon tax regulations governing the regions in which we conduct business  geographic composition of worldwide earnings  the availability of tax credits and other factors 
we believe the accounting estimates related to income taxes to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine deferred tax assets and liabilities and to record current tax benefits and liabilities  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change from year to year causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding income taxes 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions regarding future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known or anticipated engineering change orders  new products  and other factors 
we believe the accounting estimates related to inventories to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine the valuation of inventories  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary

kaydon does not undertake any responsibility to update its forward looking statements or 
table of contents risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances 
the following risk factors could affect the company s operating results 
the company s customers economic cycles may affect kaydon s operating results 
many of our customers are in industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and other factors  including capital spending levels 
such industries include commercial and military aerospace  specialty electronics manufacturing equipment  power generation  off road and heavy industrial equipment  and other capital equipment manufacturing 
as a result  the demand for our products by these customers depends  in part  upon general economic conditions 
historically  downward economic cycles have reduced customer demand for our products  thereby reducing sales of our products and resulting in reductions to our revenues and net earnings 
increased competition in the company s key markets could result in a reduction in kaydon s revenues and earnings and adversely affect the company s financial condition 
the industries in which we operate are fragmented and we face competition from multiple companies across our diverse product lines 
we expect competitive pressures from new products and aggressive pricing to increase  which may cause us to lose market share or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive  which could result in reduced levels of revenues and earnings 
our competitors include us and us companies  some of which benefit from lower labor costs and fewer regulatory burdens 
in addition  certain competitors  including perkin elmer  timken  skf  and ina fag  are larger than kaydon and may have access to greater financial  technical  development  marketing  manufacturing  sales and distribution services and other resources 
increased competition with these companies or new entrants to our key markets could prevent price increases for our products or could require price reductions for our products  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  growth or liquidity 
future acquisitions may require kaydon to incur costs and liabilities which may adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition to internal growth  our current strategy involves growth through acquisitions of complementary businesses as well as acquisitions that diversify our product offerings 
like other companies with similar growth strategies  we may be unable to continue to implement our growth strategy  and this strategy may be ultimately unsuccessful 
a portion of our expected future growth in revenues may result from acquisitions 
we frequently engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and negotiations for possible acquisitions  certain of which  if consummated  could be significant to the company 
although it is our policy only to acquire companies in transactions which are accretive to both earnings and cash flow  any potential acquisitions may result in material transaction expenses  increased interest and amortization expense  increased depreciation expense and increased operating expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
acquisitions may entail integration and management of the new businesses to realize economies of scale and control costs 
in addition  acquisitions may involve other risks  including diversion of management resources otherwise available for ongoing development of our business and risks associated with entering new markets 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future  obtain acceptable financing or consummate any future acquisitions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisitions of other businesses  we may be subject to the risk of unanticipated business uncertainties or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not indemnify the company 
future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of securities 
political  economic and regulatory conditions inherent in the international markets in which kaydon participates could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
typically  sales of our products from our foreign subsidiaries and from our domestic subsidiaries selling to foreign locations account for approximately percent of net sales 
these foreign sales could be adversely affected by changes in various foreign countries political and economic conditions  trade protection measures  differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of our products or increase our costs 
we generate significant revenues outside the united states 
currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which those customers do business may have an impact on the demand for our products in foreign countries where the us dollar has increased in value 
table of contents compared to the local currency 
we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country  often with longer term receivables than are typical in the united states 
kaydon s manufactured critical performance products expose the company to potential litigation related costs which may adversely affect the company s financial position and operating results 
as a provider of critical performance products in a variety of industries including aerospace  defense  construction  marine  medical  material handling  machine tool positioning and other industrial applications  we face a risk of exposure to claims in the event that the failure  use or misuse of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
the company  along with certain other companies  is named as a defendant in a lawsuit arising from an august fatal accident involving a mhe helicopter manufactured by sikorsky aircraft corporation 
we believe that the company has meritorious defenses to these claims including  but not limited to  the fact that the bearing utilized in the helicopter involved in the accident was inspected and approved prior to shipment by both us government and sikorsky aircraft corporation inspectors 
further  we believe that the alleged damages claimed in this lawsuit  and the associated legal costs  will be fully covered under our insurance policy  but it is possible that such costs will not be covered by insurance and  if so  we will incur unknown additional direct costs 
these claims have not been finally resolved or settled 
in the past  costs related to legal proceedings and settlements have had a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we cannot assure you that the ultimate cost of current known or future unknown litigation and claims will not exceed management s current expectations and it is possible that such costs could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  litigation is time consuming and could divert management attention and resources away from our business 
failing to continue to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of may adversely affect investor perceptions and the market value of company common stock 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  kaydon corporation has included in this annual report a report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s system of internal control over financial reporting 
also included in this annual report is a report from the company s independent registered public accounting firm on their assessment of the effectiveness of the company s system of internal control  and on their evaluation of management s assessment 
in order to issue their report  management has documented both the design of the system of internal control  and the testing processes that support their evaluation and conclusion 
while the company and its independent registered public accounting firm believe that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   the requirements of section are ongoing  and  if in the future the company s management or its independent registered public accounting firm determine that the internal controls are not effective  as defined under section  investor perceptions of the company may be adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in cash and cash equivalents 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt and investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
we place our investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a basis point decrease in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average investment interest rate for would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  canada  mexico  and japan 
therefore  changes in the value of currencies of these countries affect our financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency 
table of contents exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which many costs are local currency based 
in addition  periodically  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a percent change in the value of all foreign currencies would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and cash flows
