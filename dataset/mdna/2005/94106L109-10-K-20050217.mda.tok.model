item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december  this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on management s plans that are subject to uncertainty 
we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item of this report  under the section factors influencing future results and accuracy of forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
overview we had some positive experiences in  but also some challenges 
volumes were generally strong throughout  providing the most significant volume related revenue growth we had seen in a few years 
while generating revenue growth from pricing remained difficult  we experienced a positive change in yield on base business in we had reasonable success with price increases to existing customers in our collection line of business in most markets 
however  we continue to experience increased pricing competition in our collection operations  characterized by offers from competitors to our customers to provide the same services at much lower prices than we are charging and by lower average rates being offered by the competition on new business bids 
this was especially prevalent in the midwest group 
additionally  we experienced declines in yield from to for our landfill operations  due largely to competitive pricing on special waste  although those declines were partially offset by increased municipal solid waste pricing 
although we saw an economic recovery in that brought with it increased volumes  we did not experience significantly increased pricing 
we previously implemented a pricing model for our collection operations  and recently announced a landfill pricing study 
pursuant to this study  we chose landfills at which we will be increasing pricing on municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste 
the objective is to gather and analyze information to help us better understand the reactions to the increases  which will help us to manage our pricing in the future 
we also had continued success in implementing our operational excellence initiatives during in the area of safety  we launched mission to zero in late with the objective of promoting zero tolerance for unsafe actions  conditions and attitudes across the organization 
our goal is to attain world class safety for the protection of our employees  customers and communities 
we continue to see improvements in both our total recordable incident rate and hourly accident recordable rate  which are the metrics we use to measure our success in attaining this goal 
we also continued to make progress in in the area of fleet maintenance and route optimization 
the metric we use for our fleet maintenance is maintenance cost per driver hour  which we try to improve through basic planning and scheduling of maintenance work as well as enhanced training 
for our route optimization initiative  we use a proprietary software application called wasteroute  designed to help us organize our routes more efficiently 
we believe the optimization initiative has resulted in improved productivity as we continue to reduce the number of routes 
our plans going forward are to institutionalize the best practices we have identified to support our future productivity improvement 
in  we experienced increases in operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses as compared with the prior year 
however  these costs as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat  which we believe demonstrates the effectiveness of our cost reduction programs in these areas 
we experienced the increases in operating expenses that are expected as a result of increased revenues 
the biggest drivers increasing costs of operations were increased subcontractor costs as a result of higher volumes  some of which came from the hurricane clean up work  higher costs of goods sold  fuel costs and an increase in the cost of steel 
our costs of goods sold include rebates made by the recycling group to suppliers  and are based on market prices of recyclable commodities 
fuel costs also increased during the year  although a significant portion of those costs were offset through our fuel surcharges to customers 
the increase in dollars spent in on selling  general and administrative costs related to increased salaries and wages and increased commissions and bonuses  which are a result of the overall improvement in our operating results 
additionally  we experienced increased professional fees as a result of our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and increased litigation  defense and indemnification costs related to legal matters 
we believe that the production of free cash flow is a very important measure of our liquidity and operating results as it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends  repurchase stock and execute our acquisition program 
free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and is not intended to replace the consolidated statement of cash flows that was prepared in accordance with gaap 
we generated approximately billion in free cash flow for the year ended december  free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities  and adding to that the proceeds from divestitures  net of cash divested  and other sales of assets  as shown in the following table in millions year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures proceeds from divestitures of businesses  net of cash divested  and other sales of assets free cash flow we are projecting full year free cash flow to be in the range of billion to billion  based on estimated net cash provided by operating activities being in the range of billion to billion  capital expenditures between billion and billion  and proceeds from divestitures and other sales of assets of million to million 
basis of presentation of consolidated and segment financial information as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following reclassifications have been made in our prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation mandated fees and taxes we conformed the prior year s presentation of our revenues and expenses with the current year s presentation by increasing both our revenue and our operating expenses by approximately million for the year ended december  and by approximately million for the year ended december  cash balances we increased both our cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable balances at december   and by approximately million  million and million  respectively  upon identifying certain cash accounts with negative balances and no legal right of offset 
the related changes in our accounts payable balances during each reporting period have been treated as financing activities within the statement of cash flows as a component of cash used in financing activities other 
foreign currency translation we decreased both our accrued liabilities balance and our accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  and december  by approximately million and million  respectively to reflect an adjustment required to fully capture the impact of foreign currency translation on our consolidated canadian operations 
equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated entities has historically been presented as a component of other income in our statements of operations and the related cash flow impact has been reflected as a component of the change in other assets within our statements of cash flows 
as a result of investments we made during  this activity has become a more significant component of our net income and operating cash flow activity 
accordingly  we have shown equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities as a separate component within our statement of operations and equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities  net of distributions  as a separate component of cash provided by operating activities 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation 
net deferred tax liability during the fourth quarter of  we completed a detailed review of our deferred tax balances and related tax basis balance sheets 
the culmination of this effort was a decrease in our net current deferred tax assets of approximately million  and a decrease in our net long term deferred tax liabilities of approximately million as of december  the resultant over accrual of our net deferred tax liability of approximately million was recorded as a reduction of goodwill as this adjustment is associated with our previous acquisition activity 
our deferred tax balances and goodwill as of december  have been adjusted to reflect this change 
segments early in the third quarter of  we implemented a market realignment that consisted of moving our ohio operations to the midwest group and our kentucky operations to the southern group  both of which were previously in the eastern group 
we believe that the realignment will provide benefits to each of the operating groups affected 
specifically  the ohio market area faces many of the same issues as other industrial regions in the midwest group and the kentucky market area s rural characteristics make it similar to other markets in the southern group 
by balancing the revenues between each of the groups  we will enable the eastern group leadership team to focus on the challenges associated with the northeast corridor 
as a result of the realignment  we have reclassified the operating results of the ohio and kentucky market areas for all periods presented to provide segment financial information that appropriately reflects our approach to managing operations 
additionally  certain other minor reclassifications have been made to our prior period consolidated financials statements in order to conform to the current year presentation 
the financial information included herein has been updated to reflect these changes 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements  we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenues and expenses 
we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events  cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
the most difficult  subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills  environmental remediation liabilities and asset impairments  as described below 
landfills effective january   our method of accounting for landfill closure and post closure  as well as landfill final capping  changed as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
through december   the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with i amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and ii future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  continues to be followed  with the exception of capitalized and future landfill final capping costs 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 future final capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill  as was the practice prior to our adoption of sfas no 
the cost estimates for final capping  closure and post closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
we also estimate additional costs  pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and closure and post closure activities 
because landfill final capping  closure and post closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and post closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and results of operations 
landfill costs we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its final capacity 
this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation  excavation for airspace  landfill leachate collection systems  landfill gas collection systems  environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas  directly related engineering  capitalized interest  and on site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs 
additionally  landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property 
the projection of these landfill costs are dependent  in part  on future events 
the remaining amortizable basis related to costs to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs 
final capping costs we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events 
they then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill 
we review these costs annually or more often  as significant facts change 
changes in estimates  such as timing or cost of construction  for final capping events where the associated capacity is fully consumed immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset 
however  as the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset  the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense 
closure and post closure costs we base our estimates for closure and post closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post closure maintenance and monitoring 
the estimates for landfill closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain 
available airspace our engineers are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills 
this is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate  based on permit mandated height restrictions and other factors  how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity 
expansion airspace we also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances 
first  to include airspace associated with an expansion effort  we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year  and the final expansion permit to be received within five years 
second  we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely  using the following criteria personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local  state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill  it is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located  either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan  there are no significant known technical  legal  community  business  or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion  financial analysis has been completed  and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact  and airspace and related costs  including additional closure and post closure costs  have been estimated based on conceptual design 
these criteria are initially evaluated by our field based engineers  accountants  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
however  our policy provides that  based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill  if these criteria are not met  inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed 
in these circumstances  inclusion must be approved through a landfill specific review process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
of the landfill sites with expansions at december   landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace 
approximately three fourths of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because legal  community or other issues could impede the expansion process  while the remaining were primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one and five year requirements  which in many cases were due to state specific permitting procedures 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace  we also include the projected costs for development  as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping  and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 
after determining the costs at our landfills  we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed 
we look at factors such as the waste stream  geography and rate of compaction  among others  to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities 
we then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons  giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill 
we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event  for assets related to closure and post closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future 
these rates per ton are updated annually or more often  as significant facts change 
it is possible that actual results could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent that such estimates  or related assumptions  prove to be significantly different than actual results  or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner  the costs of the landfill  including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion  may be subject to impairment testing  as described below 
lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates  higher closure and post closure rates  and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace 
additionally  if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote  the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 
environmental remediation liabilities under current laws and regulations  we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations  or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site 
remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business 
these costs include potentially responsible party prp investigation  settlement  certain legal and consultant fees  as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up  such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy 
we estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site specific facts and circumstances 
we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation  considering whether we were an owner  operator  transporter  or generator at the site  the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site 
next  we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed prps 
estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
internally developed estimates are based on management s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties sites  information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation  the number  financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other prps who may be liable for remediation of a specific site  and the typical allocation of costs among prps 
asset impairments our long lived assets  including landfills and landfill expansions  are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
however  accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired 
if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets  rather than a single asset 
if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset  we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value 
fair value is determined by either an actual third party valuation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group 
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 
typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if any of these or other indicators occur  we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment 
several of these indicators are beyond our control  and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur 
additionally  estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill  as described below 
landfills certain of the indicators listed above require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects 
for example  a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted 
in addition  management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace 
therefore  certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry 
goodwill at least annually  we assess whether goodwill is impaired 
upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances  such as those listed above  that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill has been impaired

average yield base business commodity electricity fuel surcharges and fees total volume internal growth acquisitions divestitures foreign currency translation base business base business yield improvements contributed to increased revenues in our collection  transfer and waste to energy operations in as compared with in our collection business  the most substantial yield improvements during were in our industrial and residential operations  where nearly all of our operating groups experienced base business pricing improvements 
although the change in yield provided by our collection operations throughout has been positive  it was affected by increased price competition  particularly in the midwest  and the unfavorable impact of lower priced recycling and yard waste service programs in the south 
the base business yield improvements in our transfer business throughout have been almost exclusively attributable to the eastern portion of the united states 
however  increased pricing in our transfer business in the east has negatively affected our volume related revenue in that region 
the base business yield increases during have been partially offset by average yield declines in our landfill operations 
this decline is primarily the net result of the continued impact of lower pricing for special waste  particularly in the south and midwest  which has been partially offset by increased pricing for municipal solid waste disposal 
in  the increase in base business yield as compared to was attributable to our collection  transfer and waste to energy businesses  with a significant increase in our residential collection operations 
certain of these price increases related to additional costs and taxes were passed on to our customers 
however  the increase was partially offset by our landfill business  where we experienced decreases in price related revenue principally due to our special waste landfill operations  mainly because of an increase in lower priced event work in the southern and western portions of the united states 
commodity our revenues in both and were positively affected by price increases in all of the recycling commodities that we process 
average prices for old corrugated cardboard were up approximately during the year  from per ton in to per ton in average prices for old newsprint have also improved year over year by approximately  from per ton in to per ton in however  a significant portion of increases from commodity prices is rebated to our suppliers  thereby increasing our cost of goods sold resulting in a relatively small impact to our income from operations 
fuel surcharges and fees we experienced revenue improvements during due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges increased revenues year over year by approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  these increases were more than offset by increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices as discussed in operating expenses fuel 
volume during  we experienced significant volume related revenue increases in our collection and landfill businesses  driven principally by our southern and western groups 
a substantial portion of volume related revenue growth is due to the volume increases each of our operating groups has experienced in its industrial collection operations 
in the southern and western portions of the united states  our residential collection and transfer volumes have also made substantial contributions to revenue growth throughout the year 
additionally  hurricane clean up efforts increased the southern group s volume related revenues by approximately million 
landfill volume increases have also provided significant revenue improvements during the volume increases in our landfill business have been the most significant in the south and west  where increases in both construction and demolition waste and special waste have been substantial 
excluding the impact of hurricanes  we believe that a relatively strong economic environment has driven our volume related revenue improvements 
our revenue due to volumes decreased in as compared to  primarily in our collection and recycling businesses 
we believe the declines in collection were the result of general economic conditions and increased competition  particularly in the eastern and midwestern portions of the united states 
our loss of a contract with the city of chicago during february was the primary reason for volume declines in transfer and recycling  accounting for lost revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  partially offsetting these decreases were increases in special waste volumes at our landfills  primarily in the southern and western portions of the united states 
acquisitions in  the increase in revenues due to acquisitions was largely related to the full year impact of our acquisition of collection assets from allied waste industries  inc in the third and fourth quarters of other acquisitions of recycling  transfer and waste to energy businesses consummated subsequent to the third quarter of also provided increases in revenues during in  we also acquired the peltz group  the largest privately held recycler in the united states 
operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below our operating expenses include i labor and related benefits  which include salaries and wages  related payroll taxes  insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor  ii transfer and disposal costs  which include tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations  iii maintenance and repairs relating to both equipment and facilities  iv subcontractor costs  which include the costs of independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities  v costs of goods sold  which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities  vi fuel costs  which represent the costs of fuel and oils to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment  vii disposal and franchise fees and taxes  which include landfill taxes  host community fees and royalties  and viii other operating costs  which include equipment and facility rent  property taxes  insurance and claims costs and landfill operating costs 
the following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses  including the impact of foreign currency translation  for the year ended december for the respective periods in millions period to period period to period change change labor and related benefits transfer and disposal costs maintenance and repairs subcontractor costs cost of goods sold fuel disposal and franchise fees and taxes other when comparing the year ended december  to other periods  our restructuring  as discussed below within restructuring  resulted in the re characterization of certain labor and facility related costs 
through march   these costs were included within other selling  general and administrative costs 
after the adoption of the new organizational structure these costs were deemed more appropriate to be classified as operating costs and as such have been recorded as operating expenses since april   when the organizational changes became effective 
the components of operating expenses impacted are labor and related benefits as well as other operating expenses 
labor and related benefits after excluding the cost increases due to the recharacterization of selling  general and administrative costs as discussed above  these costs have increased year over year as a result of i higher salaries and hourly wages when compared with the prior year due to annual merit increases  ii increased overtime costs due in part to increased volumes  and iii salary and hourly wage costs related to acquisitions 
additionally  the increases in and to a lesser extent in have been partially offset by savings realized as a result of our workforce reductions 
transfer and disposal costs the increases are due principally to volume increases from both general operating activities and acquisitions 
subcontractor costs these cost increases during as compared with the prior year are primarily due to higher volumes we have experienced throughout the year  including increased subcontractor costs of approximately million in attributable to hurricane clean up services provided by our southern group 
also contributing to the increases are i the impact of acquisitions  ii increased third party transportation costs in our western group due to the service requirements of certain event work  iii higher fuel surcharges paid to third party subcontractors  and iv additional transportation costs in our eastern group due to capacity constraints at some of our landfills 
in  we also experienced  to a lesser extent  the effects of the redirection of waste as a result of landfill constraints in the eastern group 
additionally  we had increased subcontractor costs in as compared to due to i increases in subcontracted transportation costs from an increase in special waste activity within our landfill line of business  ii general volume increases  and iii increased use of subcontractors for our national accounts in areas where we do not provide services 
cost of goods sold our recycling group provides our suppliers with rebates that are driven by market prices of recyclable commodities  which means that the increase in cost of goods sold correlates directly to the increase in the market prices of these commodities and our revenue yield 
fuel we experienced an average increase of per gallon for as compared with and in we experienced an average increase of per gallon over however  a significant portion of this cost increase is offset by our fuel surcharges to customers  which are reflected as fuel price increases within our operating revenues section above 
other operating expenses the primary reason for the decrease during as compared with is the impact of the december  consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities from which we lease three waste to energy facilities 
prior to the consolidation of these entities  we accounted for these arrangements as operating leases 
the consolidation of these entities has  therefore  resulted in a decline in rental expense in  which was mostly offset by increases in depreciation  interest expense and minority interest expense 
additionally  in  we experienced increased landfill and environmental costs  but had partially offsetting gains from the sale of certain assets 
after excluding the cost increases due to the recharacterization of selling  general and administrative costs as discussed above  the increase in other operating expenses over is partially attributable to i increased landfill and environmental costs of approximately million primarily due to increases in costs associated with accretion expense on landfill asset retirement obligations related to our adoption of sfas no 
and ii increased risk management expenses of approximately million largely as a result of increases in the average cost per claim and higher financial assurance costs 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of i labor costs  which include salaries  related insurance and benefits  contract labor  and payroll taxes  ii professional fees  which include fees for consulting  legal  audit  and tax services  iii provision for bad debts  which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees  and iv other general and administrative expenses  which include facility related expenses  voice and data telecommunications  advertising  travel and entertainment  rentals  postage  and printing 
the following table summarizes the major components of our selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december for the respective periods in millions period to period to period change period change labor and related benefits professional fees provision for bad debts other labor and related benefits we realized an increase in labor and related benefits for the year ended december  as compared with the prior year primarily attributable to i increased commissions paid to our sales personnel  ii higher salaries and hourly wages that were partially offset by the workforce reduction  and iii higher bonus expense due to the overall improvement in our performance for a decline in our use of contract labor has partially offset these increases 
during the year ended december   the overall reduction in labor and related benefits was a result of reductions in salary and other labor related costs  which were primarily derived from our march reorganization and february and june restructurings 
professional fees we experienced increases in professional fees for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  as a result of higher litigation and defense costs and consulting fees for both general business reasons and our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we did not see a significant fluctuation in professional fees between the year ended december  and other selling  general and administrative costs during  we obtained favorable settlements for legal disputes  which are driving the apparent increase in costs in as compared with after excluding this impact  we have maintained our cost reduction efforts that were put in place in in  management focused on reducing spending related to travel and entertainment and other administrative costs 
this focus on cost reduction is a primary factor for the lower other selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  as compared with additionally  in we experienced increases in our legal reserves that resulted in an unfavorable effect on results as compared with also  when comparing the year ended december  to other periods  our restructuring  as discussed below within restructuring  resulted in the re characterization of certain labor and facility related costs 
through march   these costs were included within other selling  general and administrative costs 
after the adoption of the new organizational structure  these costs were deemed more appropriate to be classified as operating costs and as such have been recorded as operating expenses since april   which is when the organizational changes became effective 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization includes i amortization of intangible assets with a definite life  either using a declining balance approach or a straight line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements  which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset  ii depreciation of property and equipment on a straight line basis from three to years  iii amortization of landfill costs  including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development  construction  closure and post closure  on a units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site  and iv amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units of consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event 
the increase in depreciation and amortization in as compared to is primarily related to i an increase in our landfill amortization rate  net of the adjustment related to our landfill retirement costs  of per ton  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in landfill airspace amortization due to higher volumes  ii increased information technology depreciation expense recognized as a result of placing additional enterprise wide software systems into service during the latter half of  and iii increased depreciation expense for our wheelabrator group as a result of consolidating two variable interest entities 
the increase in our landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization in was partially offset by the impact of approximately million of incremental changes related to our final capping  closure and post closure obligations due to i the addition of new landfill expansions and the removal of certain expansions from the landfill cost base  ii permit modifications  iii the settlement of final capping events  and iv changes in certain estimates that are derived from an annual review which occurs in the fourth quarter of each year 
depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat from to restructuring in  we reorganized our operations to form market areas within our geographic groups to better align collection  transport  recycling and disposal resources 
as part of the restructuring  we reduced the number of field layers of management and eliminated approximately  field level administrative and operational positions 
in  we recorded million in pre tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure 
these charges included million for employee severance and benefit costs and million related to abandoned operating lease agreements 
all payments related to this restructuring have been made 
in february  we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating groups and reduced certain overhead positions to streamline our organization 
as a result  we incurred approximately million in one time employee severance and benefit costs 
the operational efficiencies provided by the february organizational changes enabled us to further reduce our workforce in june we recorded million of pre tax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction during during  we recorded a million credit to reduce our accrual for severance costs associated with these workforce reductions 
as of december   substantially all obligations associated with the february restructuring and workforce reduction have been paid 
the first quarter of is the final period we are obligated to make any severance payments to employees associated with the february reorganization and workforce reduction 
approximately million remains accrued as of december  for employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of the june workforce reduction  which will be paid to certain employees through the third quarter of asset impairments and unusual items in  the net gain of million for asset impairments and unusual items related to i million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and software development costs  ii million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to certain port o let operations  and iii million of gains in related to adjustments we made to our estimated obligations associated with our non nasw divested operations and our receipt of cash from a third party for a previously settled remedial obligation 
during  we recorded a net gain of million to asset impairments and unusual items primarily as a result of gains of million recognized on divestitures of certain operations that were offset  in part  by million for asset impairment and other miscellaneous charges 
in  the net gain of million for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to i our receipt of approximately million related to a previously impaired  non revenue producing asset  ii net gains of approximately million on divestitures during the year and iii reductions to legal reserves of approximately million and loss contract reserves of approximately million that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items 
income from operations by reportable segment we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern  midwest  southern  western  canadian  wheelabrator and recycling groups 
these groups  when combined with certain other operations  comprise our nasw operations 
the operations not managed through our seven operating groups are presented herein as other nasw 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  charges associated with our restructuring and workforce reductions impacted the operating results of our reportable segments in and the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the year ended december for each respective period and provides explanations of other factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments operating results in millions period to period period to period change change canadian eastern midwest southern western wheelabrator recycling other nasw total nasw canadian while general economic factors  such as foreign currency rates  favorably affected operating results year over year  a favorable legal settlement of million in the fourth quarter of and an unfavorable legal settlement of million in were the primary drivers of these changes 
eastern operating income improvement from to was driven primarily by i revenue growth due to increased average yield across all major lines of business  partially offset by volume declines in transfer  residential collection and landfill operations throughout the year  ii higher operating expenses incurred in due to the first quarter s harsh weather conditions  and iii acquisitions 
these earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs for labor and the transportation of waste  higher landfill amortization rates and the impairment of a landfill 
the most significant factors affecting the decline from to were i lower collection and landfill volumes  ii increased disposal costs largely due to disposal constraints in the northeastern portion of the united states  iii general increases in landfill operating costs and repair and maintenance costs  and iv harsh winter weather experienced during the first quarter of midwest lower operating income in as compared with was primarily due to i the harsh winter weather conditions during the first quarter of ii soft economic conditions leading to lower volume  and iii an increase in competitive activity leading to price roll backs and lost business 
these economic and competitive pressures continued to impact the midwest s results during southern operating income in has been favorably affected by i positive internal revenue growth  largely due to volume increases in higher margin landfill operations  ii acquisitions  iii increased revenue during the second half of as a result of the hurricanes in the region during the third quarter  iv favorable landfill capping adjustments in the fourth quarter of  largely offset by higher landfill amortization rates utilized throughout  and v various operating and administrative cost reductions 
these improvements were partially offset by the write off of a terminated landfill development project during the fourth quarter of results for the southern group were relatively consistent between and western the increase is primarily attributable to revenue growth  which is largely due to increased volumes in industrial and residential collection and transfer operations and average yield improvements in our commercial and residential collection operations 
these gains were partially offset by i increased labor costs  ii higher fuel costs not passed on to customers  and iii increases in third party transportation and other subcontractor costs 
results for the western group were relatively consistent between and wheelabrator the increase in operating income was due in large part to i positive internal revenue growth driven by improved electricity pricing and average yield improvements on long term disposal contracts and ii the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on december   which has increased income from operations as a result of decreased operating costs  partially offset by increases in depreciation expense the impact of the consolidation of these entities on income before income taxes is significantly reduced by increases in interest expense and minority interest expense 
wheelabrator s operating results were favorably affected by an million gain realized as a result of a legal settlement  which also significantly affected their trended income from operations for the years presented 
recycling the recycling group s operating revenues have been favorably affected by significantly higher market prices for recycling commodities 
improvements in the market prices for these commodities provide marginal increases to our income from operations because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers 
these favorable market conditions were the primary drivers of the current year s increase in earnings 
other components of income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles the following summarizes the other major components of our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december for each respective period in millions period to period period to period change change interest expense  net equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated entities minority interest other  net provision for income taxes percentage change not meaningful 
refer to the explanations of these items below for a discussion of the relationship between current year and prior year activity 
interest expense  net in  net interest expense decreased approximately million when compared with  which is due to a million increase in interest income from million in to million in this increase is due primarily to interest income of million realized on tax refunds received from the irs for the settlement of several federal audits 
partially offsetting the benefit of the current year increase in interest income is a million increase in interest expense  which is primarily attributable to the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on december  as a result of our implementation of fin the decline in net interest expense in when compared with can be largely attributed to our increased utilization of tax exempt financing  which contributed to a decline in our weighted average interest rate for the period 
for all periods  we have experienced a positive impact to interest expense as a result of our interest rate derivative contracts  which we use to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates 
the combined benefit of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in interest expense reductions of approximately million for  approximately million for and approximately million for while we expect the benefits of our interest rate derivative contracts to continue in  the benefit derived from our interest rate contracts will be impacted by changes in short term rates on our active agreements and will decline as the debt associated with terminated contracts matures 
of the million in reductions to interest expense realized in for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements  million related to the amortization of terminated swaps 
our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by million in  million in and million in equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated entities in the first and second quarters of  we acquired an equity interest in two coal based synthetic fuel production facilities 
we account for our investments in these entities using the equity method of accounting and their related losses are the reason for the versus change in equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated entities 
these equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within provision for income taxes 
if  for any reason  the tax credits generated by the facilities were no longer allowable under section of the internal revenue code  we would no longer incur these equity losses 
additional information related to these investments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interest the increase in minority interest expense over prior years was primarily attributable to the consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities on december  as a result of our implementation of fin this increase was more than offset by an increase in our income from operations as a result of consolidating the entities 
additional information related to these investments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other  net our other income and expense in and is primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation 
we experienced a significant impact to other income in due primarily to the sale of an equity investment 
in  a company in which we held an approximately interest was acquired by another entity 
we also held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition 
the proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for  million for and million for resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately  and for each of the three years  respectively 
the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for is primarily due to i the realization of non conventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills and our investments in the coal based synthetic fuel production facilities discussed above within equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated entities  and ii the realization of a net benefit of approximately million for tax audit settlements that occurred during the year  offset in part by iii state and local income taxes 
the decrease of approximately million in our tax provision attributable to our equity investments in the coal based synthetic fuel production facilities more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense for those entities discussed above 
the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for and is primarily due to state and local income taxes  offset in part by non conventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills 
additionally  in we recognized a million tax benefit on the settlement of certain foreign audits 
in  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million due to a capital gain generated in that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefitted capital loss that arose from a divestiture 
a tax benefit of approximately million was also recognized in related to the carry back of losses by our dutch subsidiary 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles on march   we recorded a credit of approximately million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts as required by fin see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in the first and fourth quarters of  we recorded net of tax charges of million and million  respectively  to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below 
through december   we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures and deferred costs associated with annual plant outages at our waste to energy facilities and independent power production plants 
effective january   we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred 
we recorded approximately million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
through december   we accrued for future losses under customer contracts that we entered into that over the contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than revenues 
effective january   we recorded approximately million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded approximately million  including tax benefit  or per diluted share  in the first quarter of as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
substantially all of this charge was related to the impact of changes in accounting for landfill final capping  closure and post closure costs 
in connection with the application of fin to special purpose type variable interest entities  we recorded approximately million  including tax benefit  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
for a discussion of these variable interest entities see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a credit of million to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to write off the aggregate amount of negative goodwill as a result of adopting sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations 
liquidity and capital resources general as an organization that has consistently generated cash flows in excess of its reinvestment needs  our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations 
however  we operate in a capital intensive business and continued access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength 
in the past  we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive 
based on several key factors we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives  we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future 
these factors include the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base  our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows despite the economic environment  our liquidity profile  our asset base  and our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation 
we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows  our liquidity and our capital resources  enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities 
in addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations  we have cash requirements for i the construction and expansion of our landfills  ii additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet  iii refurbishments and improvements at waste to energy and materials recovery facilities  iv the container and equipment needs of our operations  and v capping  closure and post closure activities at our landfills 
beginning in  we committed ourselves to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment through our share repurchase program  and in began a quarterly dividend program 
our board of directors has approved a new capital allocation program that provides for up to billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases each year during  and we also continue to invest in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our core business 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the act became law 
a provision of the act temporarily reduces the tax rate on repatriated income if the income is permanently reinvested in the us we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this legislation  which includes an analysis of the funds provided by our canadian operations available for repatriation 
however  we do not expect this legislation to materially impact our consolidated liquidity position 
summary of cash  restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt obligations the following is a summary of our cash  restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of december  and december  in millions cash and cash equivalents restricted trust and escrow accounts tax exempt bond funds closure  post closure and remediation funds debt service funds other total restricted trust and escrow accounts debt current portion long term portion total debt increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit  certificates of deposit  money market accounts  and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
restricted trust and escrow accounts restricted trusts and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of debt obligations  funds deposited in connection with landfill closure  post closure and remedial obligations and insurance escrow deposits 
these balances are primarily included within long term other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
debt revolving credit and letter of credit facilities the table below summarizes the credit capacity  maturity and outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility and principal letter of credit facilities outstanding at december  in millions 
we also had an additional million in outstanding letters of credit at december  that have been issued under various arrangements  none of which provide for committed capacity 
outstanding total credit letters of facility capacity maturity credit five year revolving credit facility a  october  five year letter of credit and term loan agreement b june five year letter of credit facility b december seven year letter of credit and term loan agreement b june ten year letter of credit and term loan agreement b june total a this facility provides us with credit capacity that could be used for either cash borrowings or letters of credit 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility  and we had unused and available credit capacity of approximately  million 
b these facilities have been established to provide us with letter of credit capacity 
in the event of an unreimbursed draw on a letter of credit  the amount of the draw paid by the letter of credit provider generally converts into a term loan for the remaining term under the respective agreement or facility 
through december  we had not experienced any unreimbursed draws on our letters of credit 
we have used each of these facilities to support letters of credit that we issue to support our insurance programs  certain tax exempt bond issuances  municipal and governmental waste management contracts  closure and post closure obligations and disposal site or transfer station operating permits 
these facilities require us to pay fees to the lenders and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the letters of credit 
we expect that similar facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit capacity in the future  and we continue to assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs 
on october   we renegotiated our three year  million and five year  billion revolving credit facilities  replacing them with a single  five year  billion syndicated revolving credit facility 
senior notes during march we issued million of senior notes due march  the net proceeds of the offering were approximately million after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses 
we used these proceeds to repay million of senior notes due april  and million of senior notes due may  with cash on hand  we repaid million of senior notes that matured on october  we have million of senior notes and million of senior notes both due may  that we currently expect to redeem with available cash 
tax exempt bonds as of december   we had approximately  million of outstanding tax exempt bonds 
we issued approximately million of tax exempt bonds during  million of which was issued to refinance higher rate tax exempt bonds 
we actively issue tax exempt bonds as a means of accessing low cost financing for capital expenditures 
the proceeds from these financing arrangements are deposited directly into trust funds and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised  which is generally the construction of collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment necessary to provide waste management services 
as we spend monies on the specific projects being financed  we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds 
as discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts section above  we have approximately million held in trust for future spending as of december  during  we received million from these funds for approved capital expenditures 
as of december   approximately million of our tax exempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield 
if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds  then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us 
these bonds are supported by letters of credit that were issued primarily under our billion  five year revolving credit facility  that guarantee repayment of the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us 
during the second quarter of  we fixed the interest rates of approximately million of tax exempt bonds that had previously been remarketed on a weekly basis 
because our variable rate tax exempt bonds require letter of credit support  fixing the interest rates of these debt instruments resulted in a decrease in our financial assurance needs 
tax exempt project bonds as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding tax exempt project bonds 
these debt instruments are primarily used by our wheelabrator group to finance the development of waste to energy facilities 
the bonds generally require periodic principal installment payments 
as of december  approximately million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield 
if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds  then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us 
repayment of these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our five year revolving credit facility 
approximately million of these bonds will be repaid with either available cash or debt service funds within the next twelve months 
convertible subordinated notes we had approximately million of convertible subordinated notes that we repaid  with cash on hand  upon maturity on january  interest rate swaps we manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt 
as of december   the interest payments on approximately billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to variable rates  allowing us to maintain approximately of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately at variable interest rates 
fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of debt instruments by approximately million as of december  and approximately million at december  summary of cash flow activity the following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended december for each respective period in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities during both and  cash generated from operations was positively affected by cash we received of approximately million and million  respectively  from counterparties for terminating certain interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities 
the positive cash receipts during were offset partially by cash payments of approximately million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our debt issuances 
cash generated from operations during was negatively affected by a million net cash outflow for the settlement of our securities class action lawsuit in the third quarter of settlement related activity impacting our operating cash flows during includes i a final net cash settlement payment  net of insurance proceeds of million plus accrued interest  ii a total tax benefit of approximately million and iii related net settlement recoveries of approximately million 
after adjusting and for the unusual items mentioned above  our cash flows from operations increased million over and million over our improved earnings and the favorable effects of our investments in two synthetic fuel partnerships are the primary contributors of this increase 
net cash used in investing activities the primary contributor to the variation in cash used in investing activities is acquisition spending  which was million in  million in and million in in recent years  our business acquisition strategy has been to focus on tuck in acquisitions  which are relatively small  accretive businesses that will easily integrate with  and provide value to  our existing operations 
however  our acquisition activity was uncharacteristically high because of a few relatively large acquisitions that were made in addition to numerous smaller tuck in acquisitions  particularly in our recycling line of business 
our current market development and capital allocation strategies reflect our desire to continue to invest in businesses that will enable us to effectively utilize our existing assets and the development or acquisition of disposal assets  which tend to provide higher returns on investment and operating margins 
we intend to continue to make accretive tuck in investments and expect acquisition spending in to be approximately million 
in addition to decreased acquisition spending  net receipts from restricted trust fund and escrow accounts in have increased million over and million over as discussed above  our restricted trust and escrow accounts are related to our i tax exempt bonds  ii closure  post closure and remedial requirements  or iii debt service requirements 
the increase in cash received from these sources is due to increased utilization of this type of financing  which is a direct result of the favorable interest rates available 
our capital expenditures have been maintained at a manageable range of annual spending of approximately billion to billion 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures during will be in the range of billion to billion 
additionally  we continue to receive cash proceeds from divestitures and other sales of assets 
in january of  we received proceeds of approximately million for the divestiture of one of our landfills due to a divestiture order from the canadian competition bureau 
from time to time  we may be required to divest of certain assets due to governmental regulations 
net cash used in financing activities the primary reason for the increase in net cash used in financing activities is the payment of our quarterly dividends  which resulted in cash dividends of million in compared with cash dividends of million paid in each of and our board of directors approved our quarterly dividend program in august  and we have declared and paid a dividend of per share of common stock in each quarter of  compared with the annual per share dividend in and additionally  the board of directors announced that it expects dividends to be per share per quarter beginning in all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the board of directors  and depend on various factors  including our net earnings  financial condition  cash required for future prospects and other factors the board may deem relevant 
on january   the board declared our first quarterly dividend under the program of per share  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  offsetting the increase in cash dividend payments were decreases in share repurchases and net debt repayments and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
we paid approximately million for share repurchases in as compared to million paid during and million paid in our share repurchases include a cash payment of approximately million to settle repurchases made in december our stock repurchases and dividend payments were made under a capital allocation program that authorized management to spend up to billion for this activity during the year 
since the inception of the repurchase program in february  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a net cost of approximately billion 
we currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above 
future share repurchases under this program will be made at the discretion of management  and will depend on similar factors to those considered by the board in making dividend declarations 
net debt repayments were approximately million in  million in and million in the following summary shows our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during proceeds of approximately million from the march issuance of million of senior notes  repayment of million of senior notes that matured in april  million of senior notes that matured in may and million of senior notes that matured in october  and repayments of approximately million of tax exempt bonds and million of tax exempt project bonds 
cash receipts from common stock option and warrant exercises increased to million in from million in and million in increased cash receipts from common stock option and warrant exercises were driven by the increase in our stock price during the year 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions thereafter total recorded obligations expected environmental liabilities a final capping  closure and post closure environmental remediation debt payments b  c unrecorded obligations d non cancelable operating lease obligations estimated unconditional purchase obligations e anticipated liquidity impact as of december  a environmental liabilities include final capping  closure  post closure and environmental remediation costs 
the amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  without the impact of discounting and inflation 
our recorded environmental liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills 
b our debt obligations as of december  include approximately million of fixed rate tax exempt bonds subject to re pricing within the next twelve months  which is prior to their scheduled maturities 
if the re offering of the bonds is unsuccessful  then the bonds can be put to us  requiring immediate repayment 
these bonds are not backed by letters of credit supported by our long term facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed re offering and are  therefore  considered a current obligation 
however  these bonds have been classified as long term in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the classification of these obligations as long term was based upon our intent to refinance the borrowings with other long term financings in the event of a failed re offering and our ability  in the event other sources of long term financing are not available  to use our billion  five year revolving credit facility 
c our recorded debt obligations include non cash adjustments associated with discounts  premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities 
these amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods 
in addition  approximately million of these future debt payments will be made with debt service funds held in trust and included as other assets within our december  balance sheet 
d our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods 
we have also made certain guarantees  as discussed in note  that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
e our unconditional purchase obligations are generally quantity driven 
we have therefore made estimates of our future obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations 
we have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely 
as a result  the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contingencies 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to i lease agreements with unconsolidated variable interest entities and ii guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
these lease agreements are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities at competitive  market driven prices 
our third party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations 
these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december  nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
seasonal trends and inflation our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months  primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste 
the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months 
our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 
additionally  certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the summer  such as the hurricanes experienced during the third quarter of  actually increase our revenues in the areas affected  although  for several reasons  including significant start up costs  such revenues tend to provide lower margins 
conversely  harsh winter weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations  which can significantly affect the operating results of those periods 
the operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our waste to energy facilities 
we believe that inflation has not had  and in the near future is not expected to have  any material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  management s estimates associated with inflation have had  and will continue to have  an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements information regarding our assessment of new accounting pronouncements can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices 
from time to time  we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount  with no multipliers or leverage 
as of december   all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by our derivative counterparties 
however  we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties  all of whom we either consider credit worthy  or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate exposure 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations  which are primarily denominated in us dollars 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations  which directly impacts variability in interest costs 
an instantaneous  one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately million at december  and million at december  this analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items  such as new borrowings  nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have approximately million of assets held in trust funds and escrow accounts included primarily as a component of other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet at december  these assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure  post closure and remedial activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality  liquid instruments including money market accounts and us government agency debt securities 
because of the short terms of these investments  we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 
currency rate exposure 
from time to time  we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany canadian currency denominated debt 
there would have been no material impact to our fair value position if there were an instantaneous decrease in foreign exchange rates at december  at december  we have no foreign currency derivatives outstanding 
commodities price exposure 
we market recycled products such as waste paper  aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities 
we enter into financial fiber swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales 
under the swap agreements  we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time 
with regard to our option agreements  we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors put options and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings call options 
additionally  we have entered into collars combination of a put and call option with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling
