csi markets medical devices  diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians 
our consolidated net sales grew by in and in both cvi and csi have consistently achieved double digit net sales growth over the three year period driven by organic growth as well as acquisitions 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued growth in millions vs

business unit cvi csi compared with cvi net sales practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to change 
the major shifts are from conventional lenses replaced annually to disposable and frequently replaced lenses 
disposable lenses are designed for either daily  two week or monthly replacement  frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months 
commodity lenses to specialty lenses including toric lenses  cosmetic lenses  multifocal lenses and lenses for patients experiencing the symptoms of dry eye syndrome 
commodity spherical lenses to value added spherical lenses such as lenses with aspherical optical properties 
these shifts favor cvi s line of specialty products  which comprise over of cvi s worldwide business and of its revenue in the united states 
definitions lens revenue consists of sales of spherical lenses  which include aspherically designed lenses and specialty lenses toric  cosmetic  multifocal lenses and lenses for patients with dry eyes 
aspheric lenses correct only for near and farsightedness  but they have additional optical properties that help improve visual acuity in low light conditions and can correct low levels of astigmatism and low levels of presbyopia  an age related vision defect 
toric lens designs correct astigmatism by adding the additional optical properties of cylinder and axis  which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea 
cosmetic lenses are opaque and color enhancing lenses that alter the natural appearance of the eye 
multifocal lenses are designed to correct presbyopia 
proclear lenses help enhance tissue device compatibility for patients experiencing mild discomfort relating to dry eyes during lens wear 
the primary reasons for cvi s revenue growth include continued global market share gains during the year with disposable toric revenue up  total toric product revenue up and disposable sphere revenue up 
cvi s line of specialty lenses grew during the year 
sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement including within rapidly growing specialty lenses 
sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of proclear toric and multifocal lenses which  respectively  increased and to million and million in the twelve month period 
while unit 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued growth and product mix have influenced revenue growth  average realized prices by product have not materially influenced revenue growth 
since the acquisition of biocompatibles in fiscal  cvi has actively marketed proclear lenses 
in many cases  practitioners now recommend proclear lenses rather than older cvi products 
cvi net sales in millions growth reported us international total reported international sales grew in constant currency to million in the year  led by sales of two week and monthly sphere products  which grew million  or 
also  sales of two week and monthly toric products grew  or million 
international sales growth was partially offset by declines in conventional spheres and torics of and  respectively 
sales in the united states grew in fiscal  primarily due to sales of two week and monthly toric products  which grew to million 
also  sales of the biocompatibles product lines  especially the sales of proclear specialty lenses  enhanced the revenue growth 
cvi new products and markets during  cvi expanded its product offerings two week disposable toric lens to correct astigmatism introduced in japan 
proclear disposable multifocal  a disposable product for wearers with both presbyopia  the blurring of vision that occurs with aging  and the symptoms of dry eye syndrome  introduced in european markets 
outlook we believe that cvi will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable and frequently replaced lenses dpr  toric lenses  aspheric lenses and newer specialty lenses including proclear products for lens wearers who experience mild dry eye discomfort  cosmetic lenses both those that change and those that accentuate the eye s natural color and multifocal lenses 
in the us  market demographics are favorable  as the teenaged population  the age when most contact lens wear begins  is projected to grow considerably over the next two decades 
the reported incidence of myopia continues to increase worldwide 
we expect greater market penetration in europe and the far east as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses 
the acquisition of ocular sciences  inc ocular brings a number of benefits to the company 
the cvi and ocular product lines are highly complementary 
ocular s disposable spherical lenses  daily wear lenses and silicone hydrogel extended wear technology augment cvi s line of specialty 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued lenses  making the combined entity fully competitive in all major contact lens product categories in all major markets around the world 
in north america  the world s largest contact lens market  ocular s strength in large retail optometric chain customers complements cvi s strength on independent professional optometric customers 
ocular s strong presence in japan and the asia pacific region provides cvi with more rapid access to significant market share in the world s second largest contact lens market where cvi currently has a low market share 
ocular s european operations  especially their strong position in germany  complement cvi s strong british  french  italian and spanish businesses 
ocular s gen ii manufacturing process supports cvi s coopersync programs targeted at lower cost lens manufacturing resulting  over time  in reduced production costs and improved gross margins 
we anticipate that cvi will continue its revenue growth at rates faster than the anticipated constant currency market increase of 
csi net sales women s healthcare products used primarily in obstetricians and gynecologists practices generate about of csi s revenue 
the balance are sales of medical devices outside of women s healthcare where csi does not actively market 
in  csi s sales increased to million  million above  primarily due to recent acquisitions 
organic growth of existing products was about 
while unit growth and product mix have influenced organic revenue growth  average realized prices by product have not materially influenced such growth 
results of operations of acquired companies are included in our consolidated results beginning on the acquisition date 
we discuss acquisitions completed in fiscal below 
acquisitions completed in fiscal are discussed under compared with in the csi net sales section 
csi acquisitions see note in december  csi announced the purchase from privately held surx  inc  of the assets and associated worldwide license rights for the laparoscopic lp and transvaginal tv product lines of its radio frequency rf bladder neck suspension technology  which uses radio frequency based thermal energy instead of implants to restore continence 
in february  cooper acquired milex products  inc  a manufacturer and marketer of obstetric and gynecologic products and customized print services 
milex is a leading supplier of pessaries products used to medically manage female urinary incontinence and pelvic support conditions and also supplies cancer screening products  including endometrial and endocervical sampling devices and a breast biopsy needle for fine needle aspiration 
milex also publishes patient education materials that discuss prenatal and pregnancy issues  breast health  menopause and osteoporosis 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued demographics favorable demographic trends also support csi s business 
the women of the baby boomer generation are now reaching the age when gynecological procedures are performed most frequently  and csi has  through both acquisition and internal development  built an extensive product line to diagnose and treat these patients 
outlook we anticipate that csi will continue to consolidate the women s healthcare market 
fiscal revenue is expected to range from million to million 
during  following the acquisition of milex  csi implemented an initiative to expand its sales and marketing efforts in order to increase organic growth over the next several years 
these programs will focus on csi s products in the incontinence  infertility and female sterilization markets using its restructured sales force of independent and direct sales representatives 
compared with cvi net sales cvi s worldwide sales grew in fiscal cvi reported net sales include biocompatibles revenue beginning in march in the following table  we adjust cvi reported sales by adding biocompatibles sales for the four month period in fiscal that we did not own them as shown on the biocompatibles unaudited ledgers to the year s actual results 
the total represents the lens business we now own 
since the acquisition of biocompatibles  cvi has actively marketed proclear lenses 
in many cases  practitioners now recommend proclear lenses rather than older cvi products 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cvi net sales in millions growth reported us international total reported adjustments to include biocompatibles sales for comparable periods four months ended february  us international soft lens revenue as adjusted us international total as adjusted total adjusted worldwide sales grew in constant currency in international sales grew in constant currency to million in the year  led by sales of two week and monthly sphere products  which grew million  or 
also  sales of two week and monthly toric products grew or million 
adjusted sales in the united states grew in fiscal  primarily due to sales of two week and monthly sphere products  which grew to million 
also  sales of two week and monthly toric products grew to million 
the acquisition of biocompatibles product lines  especially the sales of proclear and other specialty lenses  enhanced the revenue growth 
the primary reasons for the revenue growth were increase in toric lens sales 
continued momentum in europe with sales up growth in disposable spheres up 
csi net sales women s healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate about of csi s sales 
the balance are sales of medical devices outside of women s healthcare where csi does not actively market 
in  csi s sales increased to million  million above  primarily due to acquisitions 
the reported growth was slowed by declining sales in more mature product lines  softness in the equipment portion of the market and a delay in replacing an in vitro fertilization catheter that csi could no longer market when an exclusive distributor relationship ended 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued csi acquisitions see note in may  acquired prism enterprises  lp  which develops  manufacturers and markets medical devices and disposable products for the obstetric  neonatal and gynecological market 
in october  acquired avalon medical corporation the united states distributor of the filshie clip  a device used worldwide to perform female sterilization 
compared to and compared to cost of sales gross profit gross profit percentage of net sales cvi csi consolidated cvi s gross margin for fiscal  at  was equal to and cvi manufactures about of its lenses in the united kingdom 
the favorable impact of currency on revenue is offset by the unfavorable impact on manufacturing costs 
in addition  we have lower gross margin on sales to asia pacific distributors  which increased 
csi s gross margin improved to from in as we completed the integration of acquisitions including prism and avalon 
csi s gross margin was of net sales  up from in csi s margin was prior to the impact of a charge against cost of sales of about million for the phase out of the cerveillance colposcopy system 
for fiscal  absent the impact of future acquisitions  we expect that csi gross margins from recurring activities will improve as we complete integration of recent acquisitions and progress with the initiative to expand sales and marketing efforts targeted at organic growth 
selling  general and administrative expense sga in millions cvi csi headquarters consolidated sga increased by in and in  which support the increase in sales 
as a percentage of net sales  consolidated sga was in fiscal and in and cvi s sga increased in and in sga as a percentage of net sales improved to in from in on reductions of advertising and distribution costs 
however  selling  promotion and distribution costs to introduce new products continued in 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued csi s sga increased over  which support the increase in sales 
selling and marketing costs increased to support csi s initiative to increase organic growth 
in  sga increased over corporate headquarters sga decreased to of consolidated net sales from in and in headquarters expenses decreased to million as expenses to maintain our global trading arrangement declined 
headquarters expenses increased over due to various projects associated with our global trading arrangement 
research and development expense research and development expense was of net sales in fiscal  and million in  million in and million in cvi continues to invest in two research programs the development of an extended wear contact lens and an improved contact lens technology 
most of our r d expense  other than the two programs  is for clinical  regulatory and other product development activities and not for basic research 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million in and million in and amortization expense increased in fiscal primarily due to acquired intangible assets 
operating income operating income grew million or between and years ended october  in millions cvi csi headquarters percent growth other income  net years ended october  in thousands interest income gain on sale of quidel stock gain on litmus quidel transaction foreign exchange gain settlement of dispute other 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gain on sale of quidel stock in fiscal  and  we sold   and  shares of quidel stock  and realized gains of approximately million   and million  respectively see note 
gain on litmus quidel transaction in the first quarter of  quidel corporation quidel acquired litmus concepts  inc litmus through an exchange of common stock 
cooper held a preferred equity position in litmus  which equated to approximately a percent ownership 
as a result of this transaction  we received  shares of quidel s common stock 
in the third quarter of  we received an additional  shares of quidel that were held in escrow and recorded a gain of million  based on the fair market value of quidel shares on the day we received them 
foreign exchange in  the pound strengthened against the dollar  resulting in a net gain of about  we have taken steps to minimize this exposure 
our policy continues to be to hedge foreign exchange exposure whenever possible 
in  the pound strengthened against the dollar  resulting in a net gain of about million 
when we acquired biocompatibles  we inherited intercompany accounts in various currencies  primarily pounds sterling 
in  the acquisition of biocompatibles and additional capitalization for international operations provided about million in pounds sterling to a uk affiliate for short term financing 
while the loans were outstanding  the pound strengthened against the dollar  and a net gain of about million resulted when the loan was repaid 
additional gains of  resulted from currency exposures that were acquired and not hedged 
settlement of dispute in  we paid  to settle a legal dispute  and in we paid a one time fee of  to settle a legal dispute 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense decreased in  reflecting a general decrease in interest rates and reduced debt levels due to strong operating cash flow 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate etr for fiscal was down from fiscal s effective tax rate etr of and fiscal s etr of 
the reduction of our etr resulted from a greater percent of our income being taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate 
we expect our etr to be for fiscal 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued with anticipated faster growth outside the us and a favorable mix of products manufactured outside the us  cooper now expects that its net operating loss carryforwards nols in the us will last through we implemented a global trading arrangement in fiscal to minimize both the taxes reported in our statement of income and the actual taxes we will have to pay when we use all the benefits of our nols 
the global trading arrangement consisted of a restructuring of legal ownership for the coopervision foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries 
the stock of those subsidiaries is now owned by a single foreign holding company  which centrally directs much of the activities of those subsidiaries 
the foreign holding company has applied for and received the benefits of a reduced tax rate under a special tax regime available in its country of domicile 
assuming no other major acquisitions or large stock issuance  we currently expect that this plan will extend the cash flow benefits of the existing nols through  and that actual cash payments of taxes will average less than of pretax profits over this period 
after  actual cash payments of taxes are expected to average less than of pretax profits 
capital resources and liquidity year highlights operating cash flow up to million vs 
million in completed four acquisitions and paid other acquisition costs totaling million 
expenditures for purchases of property  plant and equipment million vs 
million in comparative statistics years ended october  in millions cash and cash equivalents total assets working capital total debt stockholders equity ratio of debt to equity debt as a percentage of total capitalization operating cash flows cash flow provided from operating activities continues as cooper s major source of liquidity  totaling million in fiscal and million in major uses of cash for operating activities included payments of million for income taxes  million in interest payments  million final payment on a previously accrued dispute settlement 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued with medical engineering corporation  a subsidiary of bristol myers squibb company  pursuant to a settlement agreement and million to fund entitlements under cooper s bonus plans 
working capital increased million in fiscal  as cash decreased million  primarily to fund acquisitions  marketable securities decreased million from sales of securities and the decline of the market value of securities available for sale  current accrued liabilities and accounts payable increased  and short term debt increased  partially offset by increases of million in inventory  million in receivables and million in current deferred tax assets and other 
the increase in inventory is due to the growth in the overall business  planned inventory increases to improve service levels  acquisitions and the effect of foreign exchange 
the increase in receivables is primarily due to the increase in sales 
at the end of fiscal  cooper s inventory months on hand was versus at fiscal year end cooper continued to improve its receivable collections with days of sales outstanding dso s at the end of the current year declining to days from days at october  looking forward  we expect dso s in the mid to upper s to low s given continued strong growth expectations outside the united states where dso s are higher 
based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels  we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable 
investing cash flows the cash outflow of million for investing activities was driven by payments of million on acquisitions and capital expenditures of million used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity and the continued rollout of new information systems 
the cash outflow was partially offset by million of cash received from the sale of marketable securities 
financing cash flows the cash outflow of million from financing activities was driven by net repayment of debt of about million and dividends paid on our common stock of million offset by million from the exercise of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements none 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of october   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period in millions beyond contractual obligations long term debt capital leases operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments stand by letters of credit total the expected future benefit payments for pension plans for years one through ten are disclosed in note  employee benefits 
risk management see note most of our operations outside of the united states have their reporting currency as their functional currency 
we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally on balances denominated in other than the locations functional currency 
we have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure 
we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates  as the interest rate on each of our revolving credit agreement and term loan debt varies with the london interbank offered rate 
we have decreased this risk by issuing fixed rate debt in the form of convertible debentures 
outlook we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of million plus cash from operating activities will fund future operations  capital expenditures  cash dividends and smaller acquisitions 
at october   we had million available under the keybank line of credit 
see note  subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the effect of the january   acquisition of ocular sciences  inc inflation and changing prices inflation had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three years 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus of the emerging issues task force eitf with respect to issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
the eitf s consensus states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible securities should be included in 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued computations of diluted earnings per share if dilutive regardless of whether their market price triggers or other contingent features have been met 
additionally  in its efforts to converge with international accounting standards  the fasb has issued an exposure draft  earnings per share an amendment of fasb statement no 
this exposure draft states that contingent convertible securities which contain an option to settle in cash or stock be assumed to settle in stock for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share 
cooper currently has million of outstanding contingently convertible senior debentures debentures due on july  the debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock per  principal amount of debentures or approximately million shares 
in our fiscal fourth quarter  the debentures became convertible as our share price exceeded of the conversion price for consecutive trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the quarter ended july  however  prior to july   we may not redeem at our option nor may a holder require us to repurchase any outstanding debentures 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  the company elected to adopt the provisions of eitf issue no 
and as a result included the dilutive effect of the debentures in its diluted earnings per share calculation from the time of issuance of the debentures our fiscal third quarter  in accordance with the if converted methodology under fasb statement no 
accordingly  prior period diluted eps has been restated see note 
in december  fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment statement r 
it requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
statement r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in effect removing the option  stated in fasb no 
 to apply the guidance in opinion this statement is effective as the beginning of the first reporting period that begins after june   or our fourth fiscal quarter transition may be accomplished using the modified prospective application or the modified retrospective application 
cooper currently measures compensation costs related to share based payments under opinion  as allowed by fasb no 
this will affect both our net income and earning per share as determined by the transition methodology in statement r 
estimates and critical accounting policies management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned  based on terms of sale with the customer  where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for contact lenses as well as coopersurgical medical devices  diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories  this primarily occurs upon product shipment  when risk of ownership transfers to our customers 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances  and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements 
we record  based on historical statistics  estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts  promotional and advertising allowances  volume discounts  contractual pricing allowances  rebates and specifically established customer product return programs 
while estimates are involved  historically  most of these programs have not been major factors in our business  since a high percentage of our revenue is from direct sales to doctors 
allowance for doubtful accounts our reported balance of accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash 
we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis  using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers 
when our analyses indicate  we increase or decrease our allowance accordingly 
however  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
while estimates are involved  bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base  well established historical payment patterns and the fact that patients require satisfaction of healthcare needs in both strong and weak economics 
net realizable value of inventory in assessing the value of inventories  we must make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell 
on an ongoing basis  we review the carrying value of our inventory  measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability  and reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market 
while estimates are involved  historically  obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles 
we target to keep  on average  about seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels 
valuation of goodwill we account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we no longer amortize goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
we performed an impairment test in our third fiscal quarter  and our analysis indicated that we have no goodwill impairment 
the fasb statement no 
goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
initially  we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value results 
a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our reporting units are the same as our business segments coopervision and coopersurgical reflecting the way that we manage our business 
our most recent estimate of fair value  at the time of our may   review and using several valuation techniques including assessing industry multiples  for coopervision ranged from billion to billion compared to a carrying value of million and for coopersurgical fair value ranged from million to million compared to a carrying value of million 
business combinations we routinely consummate business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of net assets purchased  acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill 
on individually significant acquisitions  we utilize independent valuation experts to provide a basis in order to refine the purchase price allocation  if appropriate 
results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must estimate a portion of our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  a valuation allowance is established 
the company currently has million of deferred tax assets that primarily represent the future benefit of us net operating loss carryforwards  which expire between and to the extent these net operating losses are not used timely by future profits  a valuation allowance or write off could result 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates 
we are required to estimate full year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction 
we adjust the estimated effective tax rate for the tax related to significant unusual items 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate  and such changes could be material 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s policy is to minimize  to the extent reasonable and practical  its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts  respectively 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes
