overview we acquire  manage  collect and service portfolios of consumer receivables 
these portfolios generally consist of one or more of the following types of consumer receivables o charged off receivables accounts that have been written off by the originators and may have been previously serviced by collection agencies  o semi performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making partial or irregular monthly payments  but the accounts may have been written off by the originators  and o performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making regular monthly payments that may or may not have been delinquent in the past 
we acquire these consumer receivable portfolios at a significant discount to the amount actually owed by the borrowers 
we acquire these portfolios after a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the underlying receivables and calculate the purchase price so that our estimated cash flow offers us an adequate return on our acquisition costs and servicing expenses 
after purchasing a portfolio  we actively monitor its performance and review and adjust our collection and servicing strategies accordingly 
critical accounting policies we account for our investments in consumer receivable portfolios  using either the interest method or the cost recovery method 
generally  each purchase is considered a separate portfolio of receivables and is considered a financial investment 
based upon the expected performance characteristics of the receivables in the portfolio  we determine whether the portfolio should be accounted for using the interest method or the cost recovery method 
if we can reasonably estimate the amount to be collected on a portfolio and can reasonably determine the timing of such payments based on historic experience and other factors  we use the interest method 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the future cash flows  we use the cost recovery method 
if the interest method is used in recognizing income on a portfolio  it is done so in accordance with the aicpa s practice bulletin  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans 
practice bulletin requires that the accrual basis of accounting be used at the time the amount and timing of cash flows from an acquired portfolio can be reasonably estimated and collection is probable 
the interest method allows us to recognize income on the effective yield of such portfolio based on the actual cash collected during a period and future estimated cash flows and the timing of such collections and the purchase of such portfolios 
under this method  we periodically apply a portion of the actual funds collected as a reduction in the principal amount invested in each specific portfolio and the remainder is recognized as finance income 
generally  these portfolios are expected to amortize over a three to five year period based upon our estimated future cash flows 
historically  a majority of the cash we ultimately collect on a portfolio is received during the first to months after acquiring the portfolio  although additional amounts are collected over the remaining period 
the estimated future cash flows of the portfolios are reevaluated quarterly 
we  in most instances  try to recoup our initial cash outlay on portfolios purchased in the first months 
under the cost recovery method of accounting  no income is recognized until the purchase price of a portfolio has been fully recovered by us 
we periodically review our receivable portfolios for impairment based on the estimated future cash flows 
the company uses both qualitative and quantitative methods for evaluating the projected cash flows expected from our portfolio purchases 
we are constantly monitoring the facts and circumstances for each portfolio 
when a portfolio is outperforming or underperforming its projected cash flows  we review the portfolio and its characteristics 
if the company feels the portfolio will out perform the original discounted present value calculation  we will raise the estimated cash flows over the future periods and adjust the portfolio accordingly 
if the company feels there will be a continuing under performance compared to the original discounted present value calculation  we will lower the estimated cash flows over future periods and adjust the portfolio accordingly 
additionally  as we have shifted to the suit strategy as previously mentioned  we have made the determination that debtor accounts that are sued  or have a lien or judgment  will ultimately have a greater collection value over a longer period of time 
in this case  we have adjusted our original discounted present value calculation accordingly 
our suit strategy has been validated by our historical experience as we have portfolios dating back to and we have tried this strategy on a smaller scale with success 
we have now changed our business model to an aggressive suit strategy and expect even better collections over the five year lives of the portfolios 
provisions for losses are charged to operations when it is determined that the remaining investment in the receivable portfolio is greater than the estimated future collections 
for the year ended september  we did not record a write off for any receivable portfolios 
for the year ended september   we recorded a  write off on a receivable portfolio 
based on actual cash flows and the change in strategy involving the increased use of attorneys and the courts in order to maximize collections for the year ended september   and the resultant changes in projected future cash flows through september   on certain portfolios as compared to what we estimated at september   we revised our estimate of future collections 
such change in accounting estimate has resulted in approximately a million increase in finance income recognized for the year ended september  for these portfolios 
for the estimates of expected cash flows  the company takes into consideration the quality of the underlying receivables constituting the portfolio  the strategy involved to maximize the collections  thereof  including collections represented by the sale of certain accounts  the time required to implement the collection strategy and other factors 
in october  the american institute of certified accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for loans or certain securities acquired in a transfer 
this sop proposes guidance on accounting for differences between contractual and expected cash flows from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
increases in expected cash flows should be recognized prospectively through an adjustment of the internal rate of return while decreases in expected cash flows should be recognized as impairment 
this sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  we have implemented this sop and through september  there has been no impact on our results 
we believe the implementation of this sop will make it more likely that an impairment loss may be recorded some time in the future 
we originally set up a discounted present value calculation based on anticipated cash flows based upon the characteristics of the portfolio purchased 
based on our experience with the type of portfolio acquired  and based on the liquidation rates expected  we then evaluate the performance of the actual cash flows to the expected cash flows 
in the event the actual cash flows are exceeding the original expectations  and we believe this is indicative of a trend  we will adjust the effective rate 
the significant portion of our portfolio purchases are credit card and wireless telecom charge offs from issuers whom we deal with regularly and for many years 
these portfolios generally have the same characteristics from purchase to purchase and thus based on our experience  the risk characteristics have not changed 
we typically recognize finance income net of collection fees paid to third party collection agencies and attorneys 
with respect to a single portfolio purchased in containing a significant amount of performing and semi performing accounts  we recognized finance income on accounts that were being serviced by third party collection agencies and attorneys at the gross amounts received by the third party collection agencies and attorneys 
the servicing costs for these portfolios are reported as an expense on our income statement 
in addition  with respect to specific consumer receivable portfolios we acquired  we agreed to a fifty percent profit sharing arrangement with our lender 
however  the interest in this profit sharing arrangement held by our lender was sold to us and a third party in equal amounts in december the third party profit allocation was recorded as interest expense over the estimated term of the related note payable 
during the year ended september   actual and estimated collections have exceeded our estimates at september   and therefore we revised our third party profit allocation 
such change in accounting estimate has resulted in approximately a million interest expense charge during the year ended september  as this charge was due to a specific portfolio  no such charge was recorded during the year ended september  results of operations the following discussion of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus 
in these discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations
