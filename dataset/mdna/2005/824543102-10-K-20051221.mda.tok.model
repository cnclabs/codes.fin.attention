item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands sustainable business model the following narrative  which includes  among other things  a description of the results of operations of the company for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal  reports significant variations and improvements in the company s recent results 
these results are the outcome of instituting a new sustainable business model for the company built upon the concepts of process characterization and process optimization throughout the organization 
process characterization is based on self analysis of the business processes of the company by the process owners  who are the people in the organization responsible for the success or failure of that process 
process characterization represents the response to seeking a way to perform a business process in a more productive or efficient manner 
logically applying these steps requires establishing priorities in order that the most serious and rewarding issues are addressed sooner rather than later 
examples of the application of the concepts of process characterization and process optimization include identifying and overcoming causes of equipment downtime  reducing die changeover time  coil yield analysis  and obstacles to the accurate transmission of electronic data interchange 
the objective of instituting these concepts was to stabilize the company and to achieve quality and productivity improvements in all processes of the company s business  including plant operations and administrative functions 
since inception of the new business model in mid year of fiscal  the company has been exiting unprofitable and non strategic businesses and has achieved manufacturing cost reductions  launched new products  improved gross margins and reduced administrative costs 
these efforts have led to improved working capital management and reduced cash requirements as well as contributed to positive cash generation and debt reduction 
during fiscal  once stabilized  the company began the process of renewal  capitalizing on its key capabilities 
this phase continued throughout fiscal began with the renewal phase continuing and leading to an emphasis on profitable growth during and beyond 
the application of the company s sustainable business model continues to be the focus of the company s management for fiscal as noted below under forward looking statements  the future success of the company depends upon  among other factors  continuing to successfully institute this strategic initiative 
general the company is a supplier of numerous parts to both automobile oems and  as a tier ii supplier  to tier i automotive part manufacturers who in turn supply oems 
the parts that the company produces supply many models of vehicles manufactured by nearly all vehicle manufacturers that produce vehicles in north america 
as a result  the company s revenues are very dependent upon the north american production of automobiles and light trucks  particularly traditional domestic manufacturers  such as general motors  daimlerchrysler and ford 
according to industry statistics  traditional domestic manufacturer production for fiscal declined by and total north american car and light truck production for fiscal declined from the production of fiscal another significant factor affecting the company s revenues is the company s ability to successfully bid on the production and supply of parts for models that will be newly introduced to the market by the company s customers 
these new model introductions typically go through a start of production phase with build levels that are higher than normal because the consumer supply network is filled to ensure adequate supply to the market  resulting in an increase in the company s revenues at the beginning of the cycle 
plant utilization levels are very important to profitability because of the capital intensive nature of these operations 
at october   the company s facilities were operating at approximately capacity 
the company defines capacity as working hours per day and five days per week 
utilization of capacity is dependent upon the releases against customer purchase orders that are used to establish production schedules and manpower and equipment requirements for each month and quarterly period of the fiscal year 
the majority of the company s stamping and engineered welded blank operations purchase steel through the customers steel programs 
under these programs  the company pays the steel suppliers and passes on to the customers the steel price the customers negotiated with the steel suppliers 
although the company takes ownership of the steel  the customers are responsible for all steel price fluctuations 
the company also purchases steel directly from domestic primary steel producers and steel service centers 
domestic steel pricing has generally been increasing recently for several reasons  including capacity restraints  higher raw material costs and the weakening of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies 
finally  the company blanks and processes steel for some of its customers on a toll processing basis 
under these arrangements  the company charges a tolling fee for the operations that it performs without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss 
toll processing operations results in lower revenues but higher gross margins than operations where the company takes ownership of the steel 
revenues from operations involving directly owned steel include a component of raw material cost whereas toll processing revenues do not 
changes in the price of scrap steel can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations because substantially all of its operations generate engineered scrap steel 
engineered scrap steel is a planned by product of the company s processing operations  and proceeds from the disposition of scrap steel contribute to gross margin by offsetting the increases in the cost of steel and the attendant costs of quality and availability 
changes in the price of steel impact the company s results of operations because raw material costs are by far the largest component of cost of sales in processing directly owned steel 
the company actively manages its exposure to changes in the price of steel  and  in most instances  passes along the rising price of steel to its customers 
critical accounting policies preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the items that follow as critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
these estimates were selected because of inherent imprecision that may result from applying judgment to the estimation process 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to these policies are initially based on the company s best estimates at the time they are recorded 
adjustments are charged or credited to income and the related balance sheet account when actual experience differs from the expected experience underlying the estimates 
the company makes frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood that material adjustments will be required 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company recognizes revenue when there is evidence of a sales agreement  the delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of revenue is reasonably assured 
the company generally records revenues upon shipment of product to customers and transfer of title under standard commercial terms 
price adjustments are recognized in the period when management believes that such amounts become probable  based on management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on several factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
additionally  the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience of write offs and the current financial condition of customers 
the financial condition of the company s customers is dependent on  among other things  the general economic environment  which may substantially change  thereby affecting the recoverability of amounts due to the company from its customers 
inventory reserves 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are used to determine cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns  and in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
the company values inventories on a regular basis to identify inventories on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  the company provides a reserve for the full value of the inventory  net of estimated realizable value 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates future demand 
additional inventory reserves may be required if actual market conditions differ from management s expectations 
deferred tax assets 
deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company established a valuation allowance to record its deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while future projections for taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets primarily include property  plant and equipment 
if an indicator of impairment exists for certain groups of property  plant and equipment  the company will compare the forecasted undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets to their carrying value 
if the carrying values exceed the undiscounted cash flows  the company then determines the fair values of the assets 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  then an impairment charge is recognized for the difference 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events 
such events may include  but are not limited to  significant industry or economic trends and strategic decisions made in response to changes in the economic and competitive conditions impacting the company s business 
based on current facts  the company believes there is currently no impairment to the company s long lived assets 
group insurance and workers compensation accruals 
the company is self insured for group insurance and workers compensation and reviews these accruals on a monthly basis to adjust the balances as determined necessary 
the company reviews claims data and lag analysis as the primary indicators of the accruals 
additionally  the company reviews specific large insurance claims to determine whether there is a need for additional accrual on a case by case basis 
changes in the claim lag periods and the specific occurrences could materially impact the required accrual balance period to period 
pension and other post retirement costs and liabilities 
the company has recorded significant pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the determination of the company s pension liabilities requires key assumptions regarding discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefit payments and the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate is also significant to the development of other post retirement liabilities 
the company determines these assumptions in consultation with  and after input from  its actuaries 
the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which the pension and other post retirement liabilities could be settled at the end of the year 
when determining the discount rate  the company considers the most recent available interest rates on moody s aa corporate bonds with maturities of at least twenty years as of year end 
based upon this analysis  the company reduced the discount rate used to measure its pension and post retirement liabilities to at october  from at october  a change of basis points in the discount rate would increase or decrease expense on an annual basis by approximately the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets is applied to the market value of plan assets to derive a reduction to pension expense that approximates the expected average rate of asset investment return over ten or more years 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return will increase pension expense whereas an increase in the expected long term rate will reduce pension expense 
decreases in the level of plan assets will serve to increase the amount of pension expense whereas increases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to decrease the amount of pension expense 
any shortfall in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will increase pension expense in future years due to the amortization of the shortfall whereas any excess in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will reduce pension expense in future periods due to the amortization of the excess 
a change of basis points in the assumed rate of return on pension assets would increase or decrease pension assets by approximately the company s investment policy for assets of the plans is to maintain an allocation generally of to percent in equity securities  to percent in debt securities  and to percent in real estate 
equity security investments are structured to achieve an equal balance between growth and value stocks 
the company determines the annual rate of return on pension assets by first analyzing the composition of its asset portfolio 
historical rates of return are applied to the portfolio 
the company s investment advisors and actuaries review this computed rate of return 
industry comparables and other outside guidance are also considered in the annual selection of the expected rates of return on pension assets 
for the twelve months ended october   the actual return on pension plans assets for all of the company s plans approximated to  which was a higher rate of return than the to expected rates of return on plan assets used to derive pension expense 
the higher actual return on plans assets reflects the recovery of the equity markets experienced from the depressed levels  which have existed since the end of based on recent and projected market and economic conditions  the company revised its estimate for the expected long term return on its plan assets to to for fiscal  from to  the assumptions used to derive fiscal expense 
if the fair value of the pension plans assets are below the plans accumulated benefit obligation abo  the company is required to record a minimum liability 
if the amount of the abo in excess of the fair value of plan assets is large enough  the company may be required  by law to make additional contributions to the pension plans 
actual results that differ from these estimates may result in more or less future company funding into the pension plans than is planned by management
