all other costs incurred in connection with the production of or purchase of rights to programs that are ready  available and to be broadcast within one year are classified as current assets  while costs of those programs to be broadcast subsequently are considered non current

accounting for intangibles and impairment goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives  such as broadcast licenses  are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually 
the television and radio broadcast licenses have an indefinite life because the company expects to renew them and renewals are routinely granted with little cost  provided that the licensee has complied with the applicable rules and regulations of the federal communications commission fcc 
over the last five years  all television and radio licenses that have been up for renewal have been renewed and there has been no compelling challenge to the license renewal 
the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology in the foreseeable future 
therefore  the television and radio broadcast licenses and the related cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely 
these indefinite cash flows indicate that the broadcast licenses have an indefinite useful life 
therefore  the license would not be amortized until its useful life is deemed to no longer be indefinite 
the licenses  other indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment exists in accordance with paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and the emerging issues task force published issue  unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets eitf 
goodwill is allocated to various reporting units  which are either the operating segments or one reporting level below the operating segment 
for purposes of performing the impairment test of goodwill as required by sfas  we established the following reporting units television  radio  music and internet 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less that its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
sfas also requires the company to compare the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
fair value for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
the company has evaluated its licenses  other indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill  as of october   and has concluded that it does not have an impairment loss related to these assets 
in the future  the company may incur impairment charges under sfas if market values decline and the company does not achieve expected cash flow growth rates 
investment valuation the company monitors the value of its equity and cost method investments for indicators of impairment  including changes in market conditions and or the operating results of its underlying investments that may result in the inability to recover the carrying value of the investment 
the company will record an impairment charge if and when it believes any investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
this statement encourages but does not require companies to account for employee stock compensation awards based on their estimated fair value at the date of the grant with the resulting costs charged to operations

 and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retrospective adoption options 
under the retrospective option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retrospective methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
the company has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r and have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  which is an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged  with certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the adoption of sfas no 
 will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the effect on the company s financial position and results of operations will primarily depend on the significance of television and radio station swap transactions the company enters into in the future
