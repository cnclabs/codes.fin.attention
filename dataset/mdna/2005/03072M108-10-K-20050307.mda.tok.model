table of contents protection products segment products our protection products segment consists of individual fixed life insurance premiums from traditional life insurance products  universal life insurance products and equity indexed life insurance products 
sales are presented as annualized premium which is in accordance with industry practice  and represent the amount of new business sold during the period 
sales are a performance metric which we use to measure the productivity of our distribution network and for compensation of sales and marketing employees and agents 
the following table summarizes annualized premium by life insurance product sales activity by product for the years ended december  in thousands traditional life insurance interest sensitive whole life term and other life universal life equity indexed life direct private label term life premiums total traditional life insurance products 
traditional life insurance products include interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance products 
interest sensitive whole life insurance provides benefits for the life of the insured 
however  this product has cash value accumulation that is interest sensitive and responds to current interest and mortality rates 
these products are used in several markets  the largest of which is the pension plan market 
lower interest sensitive whole life sales were experienced in and  as compared to each prior year  due to the development of an equity indexed product  our shift in sales focus to equity indexed products and uncertainty in government tax policy and regulation 
for the year ended december   sales of interest sensitive whole life products represented of direct sales for individual life insurance products sold 
term and other life insurance include term life and whole life insurance products 
term life provides life insurance protection for a specific time period which generally can be renewed at an increased premium 
such policies are mortality based and offer no cash accumulation feature 
term life insurance is a highly competitive and quickly changing market 
the reduction in term and other life sales in compared to was primarily a result of our ceasing to take new applications for sales of whole life insurance on december  term and other life insurance sales have declined to approximately of our total sales in in prior years  ilic had distributed term products primarily through strategic alliances with private label partners 
under private label arrangements  ilic manufactured products that were distributed through field forces of other life insurance companies  its private label partners 
following a strategic decision to exit the private label business  ilic reached an agreement with its joint venture partners to cease new business processing during in keeping with contractual obligations  ilic continues to service in force business for existing joint venture partners 
universal life insurance products 
we offer universal life insurance products  which provide flexible benefits for the insured 
within product limits and state regulations  policyowners may vary the amount and timing of premiums and the amount of the death benefit of their policies and keep the policies in force  as long as there are sufficient policy funds available to cover all policy charges for the next coverage period 
premiums  net of specified expenses  are credited to the policy  as is interest  generally at a rate determined from time to time by us 
specific charges are made against the policy for the cost of insurance and for expenses 
we invest 
table of contents the premiums we receive from the sale of universal life insurance products in our investment portfolio 
our gross margin from these products is the yield we earn on our investment portfolio plus the internal product charges less interest credited to policies and less mortality and other expenses 
sales of universal life decreased in compared to the prior periods due to the popularity of our equity indexed life products 
the weighted average crediting rate for universal life insurance liabilities was for the year  for the year and for the year the crediting rate has been lowered as a result of reduced investment yields associated with the declining interest rate environment 
for the year ended december   sales of universal life insurance products represented of direct sales for individual life insurance products sold 
equity indexed life products 
we also offer equity indexed life insurance products which are a type of universal life or interest sensitive whole life product that allows the policyowner to elect an interest earnings strategy for a portion of the account value 
earnings are credited based in part on increases in the appropriate indices  primarily the standard poor s composite stock index collectively  s p index  excluding dividends 
the earnings credit is subject to a participation rate and an annual cap 
our gross margin on our equity indexed life products is similar to that of our universal life and interest sensitive whole life insurance products 
however  due to the equity indexed earnings strategies  we invest a portion of the premiums we receive from the sale of these products in call options 
we may affect the cost of the call options by adjusting interest crediting parameters that are provided for in the policy 
our return on the call options is generally expected  in a growing equity market  to correspond to the earnings we are contractually bound to credit on the equity indexed strategies 
the remainder of the premium is invested in our investment portfolio to support the contractual minimum guarantees that may come into effect if the equity index declines 
the structure of our product  together with the allocation of our equity indexed life product premiums between call options and our investment portfolio  are intended to provide for a positive gross margin in both increasing and decreasing equity markets 
at december   the account value of equity indexed life products totaled million of which approximately is invested in equity indexed strategies 
equity indexed life insurance sales increased in and following our focus on the marketing of this product beginning in we are a leading writer of equity indexed life products in the united states 
sales of the equity indexed life product  as a percentage of direct sales  was approximately in

the states with the highest geographic concentration of sales  based on statutory premiums in  are california  florida  illinois  iowa  minnesota  new york  texas and wisconsin 
these states account for approximately of our statutory premiums 
our target customers are individuals in the middle and upper income brackets and small businesses 
we market our life insurance products on a national basis primarily through a career marketing organization cmos system  a personal producing general agent ppga distribution system  independent marketing organizations imos and a new york distribution system 
we currently employ regional vice presidents who are responsible for supervising these distribution systems within their assigned geographic regions 
under the cmo system  a contractual arrangement is entered into with the cmo for the sale of insurance products by the cmo s agents 
the cmo agents are primarily compensated by receiving a percentage of the first year commissions and renewal commissions on premiums subsequently collected on that business 
in addition  the cmo agents receive certain retirement benefits and incentive trips 
the cmos are independent contractors and are generally responsible for the expenses of their operations  including office and overhead expenses and the recruiting  selection  contracting  training and development of agents in their agencies 
as of december   we had cmo general agents in states  through which approximately  agents sell our products 
while agents in the cmo system are non exclusive  most use our products for a majority of their new business 
under the ppga system  we contract primarily with individuals who are experienced individual agents or who head a small group of experienced individual agents 
these individuals are independent contractors and are responsible for all of their own expenses 
these individuals often sell products for other insurance companies  and may offer selected products we offer rather than our full line of insurance products 
the ppga system is comprised of approximately  ppga general agents  with approximately  agents 

table of contents ppgas are compensated by commissions on first year and renewal premiums collected on business written by themselves and the agents in their units 
we have also developed programs to sell life insurance through select imos 
the customers targeted and the products sold are similar to those of the cmo and ppga systems 
under the imo system  a contractual arrangement is entered into with an imo to promote our insurance products to their network of agents and brokers 
the imo receives a commission and override commission on the business produced 
we currently have approximately imos under contract 
the new york distribution system is comprised of a combination of imos and ppgas in the tri state area  which primarily focus on the state of new york 
there were approximately  agents in the new york distribution system 
during  no single distribution organization cmo  ppga  imo  or new york accounted for more than of total direct sales 
accumulation products segment products our accumulation products segment primary offerings consist of individual fixed annuities and funding agreements 
annuities provide for the payment of periodic benefits over a specified time period 
benefits may commence immediately or may be deferred to a future date 
fixed annuities generally are backed by a general investment account and credited with a rate of return that is periodically reset 
funding agreements are arrangements for which we receive deposit funds and for which we agree to repay the deposit and a contractual return for the duration of the contract 
deposits are presented as collected premiums  which are measured in accordance with industry practice  and represent the amount of new business sold during the period 
deposits are a performance metric which we use to measure the productivity of our distribution network and for compensation of sales and marketing employees and agents 
our annuity deposits consisted of approximately from traditional annuity products and approximately from equity indexed annuity products in funding agreement deposits totaled million in and million in the following table sets forth deposits for the periods indicated deposits by product for the years ended december  in thousands annuities deferred fixed annuities traditional fixed annuities equity indexed annuities variable annuities total annuities funding agreements total reinsurance assumed reinsurance ceded total deposits  net of reinsurance traditional annuity products 
we offer a variety of interest rate crediting strategies on our traditional annuity products 
at december   the account value of traditional annuities totaled billion of which approximately have minimum guarantee rates ranging from to 
for traditional annuities with an account value of billion  the credited rate was equal to the minimum guarantee rate  and as a 
table of contents result  the credited rate cannot be lowered 
we also offer an interest rate crediting strategy that credits the policy with a return generally based upon the interest rates it earns on assets supporting the respective policies less management fees 
traditional annuities with an account value of billion had a multi year guarantee for which the credited rate cannot be decreased until the end of the multi year period 
at the end of the multi year period  we will have the ability to lower the crediting rate to the minimum guaranteed rate by an average of approximately basis points 
the remaining multi year period is generally either one or two years 
due to these limitations on the ability to lower interest crediting rates and the potential for additional credit defaults and lower reinvestment rates on investments  we could experience spread compression in future periods 
we invest the deposits we receive from traditional annuity product sales in our investment portfolio 
we call the difference between the yield we earn on our investment portfolio and the interest we credit on our traditional annuities our product spread 
the product spread is a major driver of the profitability of our traditional annuity products 
traditional annuity deposits decreased million and million in and  respectively  as compared to the prior year periods as we slowed traditional annuity sales due to the low interest rate environment and as we have shifted our sales focus to equity indexed products 
equity indexed annuities 
we offer equity indexed annuity products that provide various interest crediting strategies  including strategies linked to equity and investment grade bond indices 
for deposits allocated to indexed crediting strategies  interest is credited to these products based in part on the increases in the applicable indices  less any applicable fees and subject to any applicable caps 
similar to our traditional annuity products  we invest the deposits we receive from equity indexed annuity product sales in our investment portfolio 
at december   the gaap reserves of equity indexed annuities totaled billion which provide guaranteed rates based on a cumulative floor over the term of the product 
in addition  for deposits allocated to equity indexed crediting strategies  we use a portion of the deposits to purchase call options 
we may affect the cost of the call options by adjusting interest crediting parameters that are provided for in the policy 
our return on the call options is generally expected  in a growing equity market  to correspond to the earnings we are contractually bound to credit on the equity indexed strategies 
the remainder of the deposit is invested in our investment portfolio to support the contractual minimum guarantees that may come into effect if the equity index declines 
at december   approximately of the equity indexed annuities are invested in equity indexed strategies with the remainder invested in bonds or other fixed type investments 
the product spread on deposits allocated to our equity indexed strategy is computed as the yield we earn on our investment portfolio  less the cost of the call options  less any interest credited to policyowners  equals product spread 
the product spread is a major driver of profitability of our equity indexed annuity products 
the structure of our product  together with the allocation of our equity indexed strategy deposits between call options and our investment portfolio  is intended to provide for a positive product spread in both increasing and decreasing equity markets 
equity indexed annuity sales increased in and as compared to the prior year periods due to its popularity with consumers and agents 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a new modified coinsurance reinsurance agreement to cede of certain equity indexed annuity products which amounted to million  million  and million ceded premium in   and  respectively 
variable annuities 
through our acquisition of ilico  we obtained a variable annuity product line 
in the first quarter of  we ceased new sales of these products  except for new policies issued as part of existing employer sponsored qualified plan contracts 
all new sales were discontinued effective september  amounts in and represent deposits collected on existing business 
our agents are encouraged to make new sales of variable annuities through the ameritas joint venture 
as these sales are through the joint venture  they do not appear in our direct sales amounts 
see the discussion related to this joint venture in 
table of contents the ameritas joint venture section 
the assets and liabilities related to the direct variable annuities are shown on the consolidated balance sheets as separate account assets and separate account liabilities 
funding agreements 
we placed primarily fixed rate funding agreements totaling million and million in and  respectively 
funding agreements are insurance contracts for which we receive deposit funds and for which we agree to repay the deposit and a contractual return for the duration of the contract 
in december  a million funding agreement was terminated 
total funding agreements outstanding as of december   amounted to million compared to million outstanding at december  the following table sets forth information regarding fixed annuities in force for each date presented annuities in force as of december  in thousands deferred fixed annuities number of policies gaap annuity reserves equity indexed annuities number of policies gaap annuity reserves total fixed annuities number of policies gaap annuity reserves distribution systems we sell annuities in all states  the district of columbia and the us virgin islands 
the states with the highest geographic concentration of sales  based on statutory premiums in  are california  florida  michigan  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania and texas 
these states account for approximately of our statutory premiums 
we direct our marketing efforts towards the asset accumulation  conservative savings and retirement markets 
we market our annuity products on a national basis primarily through networks of independent agents 
the independent agents are supervised by regional vice presidents and regional directors or imos 
at december   we had approximately  independent agents licensed to sell our annuity products 
in addition  the preferred producer agency and ppga systems discussed previously are utilized to market certain annuity products 
our imos consist principally of contracted organizations  including four wholly owned organizations and one organization which principally sell our proprietary products 
the imos are responsible for recruiting  servicing and educating agents in an effort to promote our products 
the imos receive an override commission based on the business produced by their agents 
our wholly owned and proprietary organizations accounted for approximately of our annuity sales in we do not have exclusive agency agreements with our agents and we believe most of these agents sell products similar to ours for other insurance companies 
ameritas joint venture we participate in a joint venture  the ameritas joint venture  with ameritas life insurance corp 
or ameritas through alic s ownership interest in amal corporation or amal  a nebraska corporation 
amal corporation s operations are conducted through ameritas variable life insurance company  or avlic  ameritas investment corp 
or aic  and the advisors group  inc or tag  its three wholly owned subsidiaries 
avlic is licensed to conduct business in states and the district of 
table of contents columbia 
aic and tag are registered broker dealers 
our partner in the ameritas joint venture  ameritas  is a nebraska mutual life insurance company which has been in existence for more than years 
our investment in the ameritas joint venture provides access to a line of existing variable life insurance and annuity products while providing a lower cost entry into an established business  helping to eliminate significant start up costs and allowing for immediate potential earnings 
the ameritas joint venture offers  through avlic  fixed annuity products  flexible premium and single premium variable universal life insurance products  and variable annuities 
variable products provide for allocation of funds to a general account or to one or more separate accounts under which the owner bears the investment risk 
through avlic s fund managers  owners of variable annuities and life insurance policies are able to choose from a range of investment funds offered by each manager 
under the current terms of the joint venture agreement  alic and ameritas direct their new variable annuities and variable life insurance through the ameritas joint venture 
the variable life insurance products and the fixed and variable annuities offered by the ameritas joint venture are distributed through our cmos  ppga systems and one imo  as well as through the distribution systems of ameritas and avlic

as of december   amal corporation had total consolidated assets of million and total consolidated shareholder s equity of million on a gaap basis 
avlic had  million of insurance in force and million in surplus as of december   on a statutory basis 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we compete with numerous life insurance companies and other entities including banks and other financial institutions  many of which have greater financial and other resources 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the sale of insurance products are product features  price  commission structure  perceived stability of the insurer  financial strength ratings  value added service and name recognition 
many other companies are capable of competing for sales in our target markets including companies that do not presently compete in such markets 
our ability to compete for sales is dependent upon our ability to successfully address the competitive factors 
we are the national leader in market share of equity indexed life production and are the fourteenth largest fixed life company in the united states 
we also rank fifth nationally in equity indexed annuity sales and sixth nationally in fixed annuity sales through independent agents 
the rankings are as of december   and are based on industry information from advantage compendium formerly the advantage group and limra international 
in addition to competing for sales  we compete for qualified agents and brokers to distribute products 
strong competition exists among insurance companies for agents and brokers with demonstrated ability 
we believe that the bases of competition for the services of such agents and brokers are commission structure  support services  prior relationships and the strength of an insurer s products 
although we believe that we have good relationships with our agents and brokers  our ability to compete will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified persons

table of contents insurance underwriting we follow detailed  uniform underwriting practices and procedures in our insurance business which are designed to assess risks before issuing coverage to qualified applicants 
we have professional underwriters who evaluate policy applications on the basis of information provided by applicants and others 
reinsurance in accordance with industry practices  we reinsure portions of our life insurance exposure with unaffiliated insurance companies under traditional indemnity reinsurance arrangements 
such reinsurance arrangements are in accordance with standard reinsurance practices within the industry 
we enter into these arrangements to assist in diversifying risks and to limit the maximum loss on risks that exceed policy retention limits 
indemnity reinsurance does not fully discharge our obligation to pay claims on business we reinsure 
as the ceding company  we remain responsible for policy claims to the extent the reinsurer fails to pay such claims 
we continually monitor the creditworthiness of our primary reinsurers  and have experienced no material reinsurance recoverability problems in recent years 
for accounting purposes  premiums and expenses in the income statement are reported net of reinsurance ceded 
future life and annuity policy benefits  policyowner funds and other related assets and liabilities are not reduced for reinsurance ceded in the balance sheet  rather a reinsurance receivable is established for such balance sheet items 
we reinsure mortality risk on individual life insurance policies 
our retention is generally between  and  on any single life depending on the respective age and rating table 
we also reinsure certain annuity business primarily on a modified coinsurance basis 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we entered into new reinsurance agreements that for certain new universal life products  we retain the first  we reinsure of the coverage between  and  and then fully reinsure the coverage in excess of  we increased our retention levels as a result of our favorable mortality experience and the overall increase in prices in the reinsurance market

none of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
government regulation we are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations as well as oversight by regulatory bodies 
we are regulated by the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and or transact business 
state insurance and other laws generally establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers related to granting and revoking licenses  transacting business  regulating the payment of dividends to stockholders  establishing guaranty fund associations  licensing agents  approving policy forms  regulating sales practices  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports  determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus  and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted 
every state in which our insurance companies are licensed administers a guaranty fund  which provides for assessments of licensed insurers for the protection of policyowners of insolvent insurance companies 
assessments can be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states 
risk based capital  or rbc  standards for life insurance companies were adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners  known as the naic  and require insurance companies to calculate and report for statutory basis financial statements information under a risk based capital formula 
the rbc requirements are intended to allow insurance regulators to identify at an early stage inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mixtures of risks inherent in such companies operations 
the formula includes components for asset risk  liability risk  interest rate exposure and other factors 
as of december   each of our life insurance companies rbc levels was in excess of authorized control level rbc thresholds established by insurance regulators 
although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives and changes in federal law can often have a material impact on our business in a variety of ways 
our products and sales practices are impacted by federal laws and regulations  such as those related to taxation and securities 
current and proposed federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity  minimum solvency requirements  changes to the tax advantages of life insurance and annuity products or the programs with which they are used  new savings and dividend proposals and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance and mutual fund business 
regulatory bodies may periodically make inquiries and conduct examinations concerning our compliance with insurance and other laws  such as those regulating the marketing and sale of our products 
we cooperate with these regulators in conducting such inquiries and examinations in the ordinary course of our business

some of these claims and legal actions are in jurisdictions where juries are given substantial latitude in assessing damages  including punitive and exemplary damages 
in addition  regulatory bodies  such as state insurance departments and attorneys general  periodically make inquiries and conduct examinations concerning the company s compliance with insurance and other laws 
the company responds to such inquiries and cooperates with regulatory examinations in the ordinary course of business 
currently  the company and or certain of its subsidiaries are defendants in class action lawsuits brought in california state courts on behalf of purchasers of insurance products and related services 
these class action lawsuits relate to the use of purportedly inappropriate sales techniques and products for the senior citizen market 
the plaintiffs in these lawsuits are seeking a variety of damages including restitution of all surrender charge penalties  injunctive relief  punitive and other indirect damages and attorneys fees 
additionally  on february   the california attorney general and the california commissioner of insurance filed a complaint in california superior court for the county of los angeles against certain of the company s subsidiaries  including family first advanced estate planning and family first insurance services  and certain third parties alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the class actions 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that the defendants engaged in the unauthorized practice of law  claims related to the suitability of the products for  and the manner in which they were sold to  the senior citizen market and other violations of california s insurance laws 
the plaintiffs seek civil penalties  restitution  injunctive relief and other relief 
table of contents and damages 
the company believes it has appropriate defenses against these lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend its position 
the company s pending litigation including without limitation the proceedings described in the immediately preceding paragraph is subject to many uncertainties  and given its complexity and scope  the outcomes cannot be predicted 
given these uncertainties  the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from the company s pending litigation 
it is possible that the company s results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
although no assurances can be given and no determinations can be made at this time  the company believes that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to the company s pending claims and legal actions  would have no material effect on its operations and financial position

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operation of amerus group co 
should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we are incorporating by reference item business information into management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 

table of contents nature of operations see item business for information regarding the nature of our operations 
financial highlights our financial highlights are as follows for the years ended december  in thousands  except share data segment pre tax operating income protection products accumulation products other operations total segment pre tax operating income non segment expense  net a net income diluted net income per share total assets stockholders equity a non segment expense  net consists primarily of open block realized unrealized gains and losses  derivative related market value adjustments  reinsurance adjustments  non insurance operations  restructuring costs  interest expense  income taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting 
operating segment income increased for the protection products segment in compared to primarily as a result of increased open block margins and lower operating expenses 
operating segment income decreased for the protection products segment in compared to primarily as a result of lower net investment income and the continued decrease in closed block operating income 
the continued shift in our business from traditional fixed annuities to higher margin equity indexed annuities and more assets under management increased accumulation products segment earnings in and compared to the respective years 
the increased operating segment income in for the protection products and accumulation products segments was partially reduced by higher other operations losses resulting primarily from additional holding company expenses 
net income increased in compared to primarily as a result of higher operating segment income  reductions in income tax accruals and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  and the gain on the sale of our residential financing subsidiary 
the increase was partially offset by realized and unrealized losses on assets 
net income increased in compared to primarily due to increased realized gains on open block investments and increased net unrealized gains from market value adjustments on trading securities  derivatives and equity indexed contracts 
total assets increased billion in primarily as a result of net cash received from collected premiums and deposits  positive cash flows from operating activities and the utilization of securities lending and borrowing arrangements 
liabilities increased primarily due to policy reserves and policyowner funds which increased due to the higher volume of insurance in force and additional securities lending and borrowing arrangements 
stockholders equity increased million during primarily as a result of net income of million  stock issued under incentive plans amounting to million and additional unrealized gains on available for sale investments of million 
the unrealized gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income are presented after related adjustments to dac  voba  
table of contents capitalized bonus interest  closed block policyowner dividend obligation  unearned revenue reserves and deferred income taxes 
the additions to equity were reduced by treasury stock purchases which decreased equity million and dividends declared in the fourth quarter of which decreased equity million 
segment income we have two operating segments protection products and accumulation products 
we use the same accounting policies and procedures to measure operating segment income as we use to measure consolidated income from operations with the exception of the elimination of certain items which management believes are not necessarily indicative of overall operating trends 
these items are as follows realized unrealized gains and losses on open block assets 
market value changes and amortization of assets and liabilities associated with the accounting for derivatives  such as unrealized gains and losses on open block options and securities held for trading 
change in option value of equity indexed products and market value adjustments on total return strategy annuities 
cash flow hedge amortization 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac and value of business acquired voba related to the unrealized and realized gains and losses on the open block investments and the derivative adjustments 
demutualization costs 
restructuring costs 
certain reinsurance adjustments 
other income from non insurance operations 
interest expense 
income tax expense 
income from discontinued operations 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting 
these items will fluctuate from period to period depending on the prevailing interest rate and economic environment or are not part of the core insurance operations 
as a result  management believes they do not reflect the ongoing earnings capacity of our operating segments 
protection products our protection products segment primarily consists of interest sensitive whole life  term life  universal life and equity indexed life insurance policies 
these products are marketed on a national basis primarily through cmos  ppga system and imos 
included in the protection products segment is the closed block of alic and the closed block of ilic  established when the companies reorganized from mutual companies to stock companies 
when protection products are sold  we invest the premiums we receive in our investment portfolio and establish a liability representing our commitment to the policyholder 
we manage investment spread by seeking to maximize the return on these invested assets  consistent with our asset liability and credit quality policies 
we enter into reinsurance arrangements in order to reduce the effects of mortality risk and the statutory capital strain from writing new business 
all income statement line items are presented net of reinsurance amounts 
protection products in force totaled billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  protection products in force is a performance

a summary of our protection products segment operations follows for the years ended december  in thousands revenues insurance premiums product charges net investment income realized gains losses on closed block investments other income total revenues benefits and expenses policyowner benefits underwriting  acquisition and other expenses amortization of dac and voba  net of open block gain loss adjustment dividends to policyowners total benefits and expenses pre tax operating income protection products segment pre tax operating income from our protection products increased in and decreased in compared to the respective prior years 
the increase in was primarily due to higher open block product margins and lower operating expenses 
higher product margins increased open block operating income in compared to  however  the declining closed block glide path see dividends to policyowners for additional information offset the open block operating income 
the key drivers of our protection products business include sales  persistency  net investment income  mortality and expenses 
sales  premiums and product charges 
sales are a key driver of our business as they are a leading indicator of future revenue trends to emerge in segment operating income 
as shown in the sales activity by product table presented in item business protection products segment  direct first year annualized premiums increased in compared to and decreased in compared to the increase in resulted from higher equity indexed life product sales as we continue to focus our marketing efforts on this product 
the equity indexed life product allows the policyowner to elect an earnings strategy for a portion of the account value whereby earnings are credited based primarily on increases in the s p index  excluding dividends 
the earnings credit is subject to a participation rate and an annual cap 
sales of equity indexed life products were million in as compared to million in and million in we are the leading writer of equity indexed life products in the united states 
the increase in was partially offset by decreased traditional and universal life insurance product sales due to our continued shift in sales focus to equity indexed products and uncertainty in government tax policy and regulation 
the decrease in resulted from lower traditional and universal life insurance product sales as we re priced our products and discontinued our par whole life product 
the lower traditional and universal sales were partially offset by increased equity indexed life sales 
we recognize premiums on traditional life insurance policies as revenues when the premiums are due 
amounts received as payments for universal life and equity indexed life insurance policies are not recorded as premium revenue  but are instead recorded as a policyholder liability 
revenues from the universal life and equity indexed life policies consist of charges for the cost of insurance  policy administration and policy surrender and are shown as product charges 
all revenue is reported net of reinsurance ceded 

table of contents insurance premium revenue in and was lower than the respective prior years primarily due to lower sales of traditional products  additional premiums ceded and a decline in closed block in force business 
persistency 
persistency  which we measure in terms of a lapse rate  is a key driver of our business as it refers to the policies which remain in our block of business 
a low lapse rate means higher persistency indicating more business is remaining in force to generate future revenues 
annualized lapse rates were in compared to in and in our persistency experience remained within our pricing assumptions 
net investment income 
net investment income is a key driver of our business as it reflects earnings on our invested assets 
net investment income increased in and decreased in compared to the respective prior years 
the increase in was primarily due to growth in average protection products assets which were approximately million higher than the decrease in net investment income in was due to low interest rates and increased prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
the earned rate of the investment portfolio was in compared to in and in the decrease in rates in and was primarily a result of the continued low interest rate environment 
mortality and benefit expense 
mortality is a key driver of our business as it impacts the amount of our benefit expense 
we utilize reinsurance to reduce the effects of mortality risk 
although we experienced unfavorable mortality in as compared to  our experience remained within our pricing assumptions 
in addition  we had increased reinsurance recoveries in and  which reduce benefit expense  as a result of additional reinsurance arrangements 
underwriting  acquisition and other expenses 
underwriting  acquisition and other expenses are a key driver of our business as they are costs of our operations 
expenses decreased in and compared to the respective prior years primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the restructuring activities that took place in and prior years to integrate the ilico life operations and also due to increased reimbursement from reinsurers of non deferrable commission and expense allowances  as more policies are subject to reinsurance 
amortization of dac and voba 
the amortization of dac and voba are expense items which increased in and as compared to the respective prior years 
dac and voba are generally amortized in proportion to policy gross margins which increased in both years  resulting in higher amortization expense 
dividends to policyowners 
in addition to basic policyowner dividends  dividend expense includes increases or decreases to the closed block policyowner dividend obligation liability carried on the consolidated balance sheet 
the actual results of the closed block are adjusted to equal the expected earnings based on the actuarial calculation at the time of formation of the closed block which we refer to as the closed block glide path 
the adjustment to have the closed block operating results equal the closed block glide path is made to dividend expense 
if the actual results for the period exceed the closed block glide path  increased dividend expense is recorded as a policyowner dividend obligation to reduce the actual closed block results 
for actual results less than the closed block glide path  dividend expense is reduced to increase the actual closed block results 
as a result of this accounting treatment  operating earnings from the closed block only include the predetermined closed block glide path 
dividend expense decreased for and compared to the respective prior years 
the decreases were primarily due to reduced closed block earnings  resulting from lower closed block revenues and net investment income as the closed block in force business continues to decline  and from closed block dividend reductions 
outlook 
we expect to continue to shift our sales to higher return products  in particular the equity indexed life products 
we also expect to continue to realize operating efficiencies as we continue to centralize our administrative functions 

table of contents accumulation products our accumulation products segment primary offerings consist of individual fixed annuities and funding agreements 
the fixed annuities are marketed on a national basis primarily through imos and independent brokers 
similar to our protection products segment  we invest the premiums we receive from accumulation product deposits in our investment portfolio and establish a liability representing our commitment to the policyowner 
we manage product spread by seeking to maximize the return on our invested assets consistent with our asset liability management and credit quality policies 
when appropriate  we periodically reset the interest rates credited to our policyowner liability 
accumulation products reserves totaled billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  a summary of our accumulation products segment operations follows for the years ended december  in thousands revenues immediate annuity and supplementary contract premiums product charges net investment income other income total revenues benefits and expenses policyowner benefits underwriting  acquisition and other expenses amortization of dac and voba dividends to policyowners total benefits and expenses imo operations other income other expenses net imo operating income loss pre tax operating income accumulation products segment pre tax operating income from our accumulation products operations increased in and in compared to the respective prior years 
the increase was primarily due to higher assets under management and improved product spreads 
the increase was primarily due to higher assets under management which were reduced by decreased product spreads 
the increases for both years were partially offset by lower contributions from imo operations 
the drivers of profitability in our accumulation products business are deposits  persistency  product spread  expenses and imo operations 
deposits 
deposits are a key driver of our business as this is a measure which represents collected premiums to be deposited to policyowner accounts for which we will earn a future product spread 
deposits are presented as collected premiums  which are measured in accordance with industry practice  and represent the amount of new business sold during the period 
deposits are a performance metric which we use to measure the productivity of our distribution network and for compensation of sales and marketing employees and agents 
as shown in the deposits by product table presented in item business accumulation products segment  total annuity deposits increased in compared to and decreased in as compared to the increase in was driven by our promotion of equity indexed products 
the decrease in was primarily a result of the slowing of our traditional annuity sales due to the low interest rate 
table of contents environment as we focused sales on our higher returning equity indexed products 
the reduced traditional annuity sales offset the increase in equity indexed products 
we placed fixed rate funding agreements totaling million in and million in funding agreements are insurance contracts for which we receive deposit funds and for which we agree to repay the deposit and a contractual return for the duration of the contract 
in december  a million funding agreement originally placed in was terminated 
total funding agreements outstanding as of december  amounted to million compared to million outstanding at december  the deposits we receive on accumulation products are not recorded as revenue but instead as a policyowner liability 
surrender charges collected on accumulation products are recorded as revenue and shown as a product charge 
product charges increased in and as compared to the respective prior years due to the growth in the business 
persistency 
persistency  which we measure in terms of a withdrawal rate  is a key driver of our business as it refers to the policies which remain in our block of business 
a low withdrawal rate reflects higher persistency indicating more business is remaining in force to generate future revenues 
withdrawals represent funds taken out of accumulation products by policyowners not including those due to the death of policyowners 
annuity withdrawal rates without internal replacements continued to improve in as compared to and and amounted to  and  respectively 
annuity withdrawals without internal replacements totaled  million in   million in and  million in our withdrawal experience remained within our pricing assumptions 
product spread 
product spread is a key driver of our business as it measures the difference between the income earned on our invested assets and the rate which we credit to policyowners  with the difference reflected as segment operating income 
asset earned rates and liability crediting rates were as follows for our annuity products for the years ended december  asset earned rate liability credited rate product spread the product spread increased basis points to basis points in compared to and decreased basis points to basis points in compared to liability crediting rates on traditional annuities were lowered throughout and to correspond with the decline in investment yields caused by lower rates on new and reinvested funds 
as described in the traditional annuity products and equity indexed annuities sections presented in item business accumulation products segment  the annuity products have various differentials between the credited rate and minimum guarantee rate  including some which have no differential  and as such cannot be lowered 
additionally  some traditional annuities have multi year interest rate guarantees for which the credited rate cannot be decreased until the end of the multi year period 
due to these limitations on the ability to lower interest crediting rates and the potential for credit defaults and lower reinvestment rates on investments  we could experience spread compression in future periods 
we also earn a spread on our funding agreements 
funding agreement income less associated interest expense totaled million in  million in  and million in the decrease was due to the termination of a million funding agreement during the fourth quarter of the increase was due to the million of funding agreements placed throughout underwriting  acquisition and other expenses 
underwriting  acquisition and other expenses are a key driver of our business as they represent costs of our operations 
expenses in and decreased compared to the respective prior years due primarily to continued process improvements to enhance operating efficiencies and lower fees associated with a declining block of annuity business processed by a third party administrator 

table of contents imo operations 
imo operations are a key driver of our business as the earnings from the imos can be a significant component of the accumulation products segment operating income 
imos have contractual arrangements to promote our insurance products in their networks of agents and brokers 
additionally  they also contract with third party insurance companies 
we own five such imos 
the income from imo operations primarily represents annuity commissions received by our imos from those third party insurance companies 
net imo operating income decreased million in and million in compared to the respective prior years due to changes in distribution strategies and higher operating expenses  including litigation costs in outlook 
we anticipate increased product sales from our imos but decreased product sales from other distribution channels as we manage our sales in this current low interest rate environment 
we also expect to continue the shift of our product mix to higher return products  in particular the equity indexed annuity products 
we will continue to manage our spreads as we strive for our desired profitability in this economic environment 
other the other operations consist of our non core lines of business outside of protection and accumulation products 
these lines of business include holding company revenues and expenses  operations of our real estate management subsidiary  and accident and health insurance 
the pre tax operating loss of our other operations increased in compared to primarily due to increased holding company expenses  such as sarbanes oxley internal control regulations  the oceans exchange and succession activities in  and lower investment income of our real estate management subsidiary

realized gains losses on open block investments will fluctuate from period to period depending on the prevailing interest rates  the economic environment and the timing of investment sales and credit events 
as part of managing our invested assets  we routinely sell securities and realize gains and losses 
during  we sold our indianapolis  indiana office building 
we had previously listed this building with a real estate broker in as part of our restructuring plan and recorded a pre tax impairment loss of million at that time see further discussion in restructuring costs 
the sale of the building in resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
realized gains on open block investments in included million of gains on sales of investments previously impaired and written down in or  primarily american airlines  dynegy holdings  intermedia communications and nrg northeast generating 
realized gains losses on open block investments in consisted primarily of realized losses and writedowns on investments related to dynegy holdings  green tree financial  national century  nrg northeast generating  trenwick group  united airlines  us air and worldcom inc 
table of contents unrealized gains losses on open block options and trading investments also will fluctuate from period to period depending on prevailing interest rates  the economic environment  the timing of investment sales and credit events 
we use options to hedge our equity indexed products 
in accounting for derivatives  we adjust our options to market value  which  due to the economic environment and stock market conditions  resulted in an unrealized gain of million in  an unrealized gain of million in and an unrealized loss of million in in addition  we also have trading securities that back our total return strategy traditional annuity products 
the market value adjustment on the trading securities resulted in an unrealized gain of million in  a gain of million in and a loss of million in most of the unrealized gains and losses on the options and trading securities are offset by similar adjustments to the option portion of the equity indexed product reserves and to the total return strategy annuity reserves 
the reserve adjustments are reflected in policyowner benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income and are included in the fair value change as additional expense of million in and million in  and reduced expense of million in the fair value change in options embedded within our equity indexed products and the fair value changes on our total return strategy traditional annuity contracts are being recorded at fair value 
as previously discussed  these fair value changes are offset by similar adjustments to unrealized gains losses on investments related to the fair value changes on the options that hedge the equity indexed products and on the trading securities that back the total return strategy products 
reinsurance adjustments 
reinsurance related adjustments in consist of the release of an million liability in conjunction with the settlement and amendment of a reinsurance arrangement and a million true up of pre reinsurance settlements under a reinsurance arrangement between ilic s open block and closed block 
demutualization costs 
the demutualization costs are primarily for commissions  postage and printing under a commission free program required by ilic s demutualization which allowed shareholders with less than one hundred shares to redeem their shares for cash or to purchase additional shares  commission free  to reach a holding of at least one hundred shares 
since these costs are not ongoing  they have been excluded from our segment results 
restructuring costs 
restructuring costs relate to our consolidation of various functions in connection with a restructuring of our protection products and accumulation products operations and investment activities which began in the third quarter of the objective of the restructuring plan was to eliminate duplicative functions for all business units and to reduce on going operating costs 
corporate administrative functions were transitioned so they are performed primarily in des moines  iowa 
protection products administration processes were transitioned so they are performed in des moines  woodbury  new york  or outsourced 
accumulation products functions were transitioned to topeka  kansas 
investment activities were restructured to eliminate certain real estate management services which have been outsourced 
the restructuring charges expensed in included pre tax severance and termination benefits of million related to the termination of approximately ten positions and for severance accrual adjustments and other pre tax costs of million primarily related to the impairment loss on the indianapolis office building  expenses associated with the merger of il annuity into ilic  and systems conversion costs 
the restructuring charges expensed in included pre tax severance and termination benefits of million related to the elimination of approximately positions and other pre tax costs of million primarily related to systems conversion and relocation of employees 
charges for all restructuring activities were completed in interest expense 
interest expense increased in and as compared to the respective prior years 
the increases were primarily due to interest associated with the prides securities of million issued in the second quarter of income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate for varied from the prevailing corporate rate primarily as a result of reductions in the income tax accrual and deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the accrual reduction amounting to million in represents an overpayment of tax in prior years for which 
table of contents a refund is expected 
there were also accrual reductions of million in  for the release of provisions originally established for potential tax adjustments which have been settled or eliminated 
in addition  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reduced million in as a result of the realization of capital loss carry forwards 
the effective income tax rate for and varied from the prevailing corporate rate primarily due to tax exempt income 
discontinued operations 
in november  we entered into an agreement to sell our residential financing operations 
the results of the residential financing operations have been classified as discontinued operations 
the sale was completed in january  resulting in an after tax gain of million 
change in accounting 
effective january   we adopted statement of position sop  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain non traditional long duration insurance contracts and for separate accounts  resulting in the establishment of additional policy reserve liabilities for fees charged for insurance benefit features which are assessed in a manner that is expected to result in profits in earlier years and losses in subsequent years 
the total effect of adopting sop including reinsurance recoverables as of january   amounted to a decrease of million million after tax in net income which has been reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting

s cash flows from operations consist of dividends from subsidiaries  if declared and paid  interest from income on loans and advances to subsidiaries including a surplus note issued to us by alic  investment income on our assets and fees which we charge our subsidiaries  offset by the expenses incurred for debt service  salaries and other expenses 
the payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated under various state laws 
generally  under the various state statutes  our insurance subsidiaries dividends may be paid only from the earned surplus arising from their respective businesses and must receive the prior approval of the respective state regulator to pay any dividend that would exceed certain statutory limitations 
the current statutes generally limit any dividend  together with dividends paid out within the preceding months  to the greater of i of the respective company s policyowners statutory surplus as of the preceding year end or ii the statutory net gain from operations for the previous calendar year 
generally  the various state laws give the state regulators discretion to approve or disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits 
based on these limitations and results  our life insurance subsidiaries could have paid us an estimated million in dividends in without obtaining regulatory approval 
our subsidiaries paid us approximately million in based on results  our subsidiaries can pay an estimated million in dividends without obtaining regulatory approval during we also consider risk based capital levels  capital and liquidity operating needs  and other factors prior to paying dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
we generated cash flows from operating activities of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
operating cash flows were primarily used to increase our investment portfolio 

table of contents we have a million revolving credit facility which we refer to as the revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders 
as of december   there was no outstanding loan balance under the facility 
the revolving credit agreement provides for typical events of default and covenants with respect to the conduct of business and requires the maintenance of various financial levels and ratios 
among other covenants  we a cannot have a leverage ratio greater than  b cannot have an interest coverage ratio less than  c are prohibited from paying cash dividends on common stock in excess of an amount equal to of consolidated net worth as of the last day of the preceding fiscal year  d must cause our insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain levels of risk based capital  and e are prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of certain limits typical for such lines of credit 
we closely monitor all of these covenants to ensure continued compliance 
on may   we issued million of prides securities and on december  we exchanged million of aggregate original principal amount of oceans as previously discussed in item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters  and issuer purchases of equity securities  which portions are incorporated herein by reference 
the company has several options for deploying excess capital  including supporting higher sales growth  reducing debt levels  pursuing acquisitions and buying back common stock 
our board of directors approved a stock purchase program effective august   under which we may purchase up to three million shares of our common stock at such times and under such conditions  as we deem advisable 
the purchases may be made in the open market or by such other means as we determine to be appropriate  including privately negotiated purchases 
the purchase program supercedes all prior purchase programs 
we plan to fund the purchase program from a combination of our internal sources  dividends from insurance subsidiaries and the revolving credit agreement 
approximately million shares remain available for repurchase under this program 
there were  shares purchased in for million 
holding company cash was utilized to purchase the shares 
we manage liquidity on a continuing basis 
one way is to minimize our need for capital 
we accomplish this by attempting to use our capital as efficiently as possible and by developing capital efficient products in our insurance subsidiaries 
we also manage our mix of sales by focusing on the more capital efficient products 
in addition  we use reinsurance agreements  where cost effective  to reduce capital strain in the insurance subsidiaries 
we also focus on optimizing the consolidated capital structure to properly balance the levels and sources of borrowing and the issuance of equity securities 
insurance subsidiaries the sources of cash of our insurance subsidiaries consist primarily of premium receipts  deposits to policyowner account balances  and income from investments  sales  maturities and calls of investments and repayments of investment principal 
the uses of cash are primarily related to withdrawals of policyowner account balances  investment purchases  payment of policy acquisition costs  payment of policyowner benefits  payment of debt  income taxes and current operating expenses 
insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow from operations  as measured by the amount by which cash flows are adequate to meet benefit obligations to policyowners and normal operating expenses as they are incurred 
the remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for writing new business 
management believes that the current level of cash and available for sale  held for trading and short term securities  combined with expected net cash inflows from operations  maturities of fixed maturity investments  principal payments on mortgage backed securities and sales of its insurance products  will be adequate to meet the anticipated short term cash obligations of the insurance subsidiaries 
matching the investment portfolio maturities to the cash flow demands of the type of insurance being provided is an important consideration for each type of protection product and accumulation product 
we continuously monitor benefits and surrenders to provide projections of future cash requirements 
as part of this monitoring process  we perform cash flow testing of assets and liabilities under various scenarios to evaluate the adequacy of reserves 
in developing our investment strategy  we establish a level of cash and 
table of contents securities which  combined with expected net cash inflows from operations and maturities and principal payments on fixed maturity investment securities  are believed adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term benefit and expense payment obligations 
there can be no assurance that future experience regarding benefits and surrenders will be similar to historic experience since withdrawal and surrender levels are influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment and general economic conditions and the claims paying and financial strength ratings of the insurance subsidiaries 
we take into account asset liability management considerations in the product development and design process 
contract terms for the interest sensitive products include surrender and withdrawal provisions which mitigate the risk of losses due to early withdrawals 
these provisions generally do one or more of the following limit the amount of penalty free withdrawals  limit the circumstances under which withdrawals are permitted  or assess a surrender charge or market value adjustment relating to the underlying assets 
in addition to the interest sensitive products  our insurance subsidiaries have issued funding agreements totaling million outstanding as of december   consisting primarily of six to ten year fixed rate insurance contracts 
the assets backing the funding agreements are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the insurance subsidiaries 
the funding agreements are further backed by the general account assets of the insurance subsidiaries 
the segregated assets and liabilities are included with general account assets in the financial statements 
the funding agreements may not be cancelled by the holders unless there is a default under the agreement  but the insurance subsidiaries may terminate the agreement at any time 
during  a million funding agreement which was placed in was terminated by us 
we also have variable separate account assets and liabilities representing funds that are separately administered  principally for variable annuity contracts  and for which the contractholder bears the investment risk 
separate account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and amounted to million at december  separate account contractholders have no claim against the assets of the general account 
the operations of the separate accounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
through their respective memberships in the federal home loan banks fhlb of des moines and topeka  alic and american are eligible to borrow under variable rate short term fed funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity 
these borrowings are secured and interest is payable at the current rate at the time of each advance 
there were no borrowings outstanding under these arrangements at december  in addition  alic has long term fixed rate advances from the fhlb outstanding of million at december  the insurance subsidiaries may also obtain liquidity through sales of investments 
the investment portfolio as of december   had a carrying value of billion  including closed block investments 
the level of capital in the insurance companies is regulated by risk based capital formulas and is monitored by rating agencies 
in order to maintain appropriate capital levels  it may be necessary from time to time for amerus group co 
to provide additional capital to the insurance companies 
we participate in a securities lending program whereby certain fixed maturity securities from the investment portfolio are loaned to other institutions for a short period of time 
we receive a fee in exchange for the loan of securities and require initial collateral equal to percent  with an on going level of percent  of the market value of the loaned securities to be separately maintained 
securities with a market value of approximately million and million were on loan under the program and we were liable for cash collateral under our control of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the collateral held under the securities lending program has been included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and the obligation to return the collateral upon the return of the loaned securities has been included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
we may also enter into securities borrowing arrangements from time to time whereby we borrow securities from other institutions and pay a fee 
securities borrowed amounted to million and none at 
table of contents december   and  respectively  and are also included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance subsidiaries was approximately  million 
management believes that each insurance company has statutory capital which provides adequate risk based capital that exceeds required levels 
in the future  in addition to cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity  the insurance subsidiaries may obtain their required capital from amerus group co 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantee obligations certain partnership investments provide for commitments of future capital  loans or guarantees 
we have obligations to make future capital contributions to various partnerships of up to million at december  we also have commitments to extend credit for mortgages totaling million at december  in addition  at december   we had loan guarantees which totaled million 
alic and its joint venture partner are contingently liable in the event avlic cannot meet its obligations 
at december   avlic had statutory assets of  million  liabilities of  million and surplus of million 
we are contingently liable for the portion of the policies reinsured under existing reinsurance agreements in the event the reinsurance companies are unable to pay their portion of any reinsured claim 
management believes that any liability from this contingency is unlikely 
however  to limit the possibility of such losses  we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor concentration of credit risk 
summary of contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of amounts owed for annuity and other non life insurance payments  notes payable  operating lease commitments  interest payable and securities lending and borrowing obligations 
a summary of obligations are as follows for each of the five years ending december  payments due by period obligation total thereafter in thousands notes payable operating leases interest payable securities lending and borrowing obligations annuity and other non life insurance payments purchase obligations other liabilites total the obligation is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
represents future payments for annuities and other non life insurance obligations 
such obligations are included in the determination of reserves and are included in policy reserves and policyowner funds on the consolidated balance sheet 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities 
the valuation of financial instruments  accounting for derivatives and amortization of dac and voba are considered our critical accounting policies due to their subjective nature and significance to the financial statements 
valuation of financial instruments a significant portion of our assets are carried at fair value  primarily securities available for sale  securities held for trading purposes and derivative financial instruments 
market values are based on quoted market prices where available 
securities in our portfolio with a carrying value of approximately  million and  million at december  and  respectively  do not have readily determinable market prices 
valuation techniques vary by security type and availability of market data 
fair values for securities which do not have a readily available market price are determined by a matrix process that uses a current market spread added to an applicable treasury rate to discount expected future cash flows applicable to the coupon rate  credit quality  industry sector and term of the investment  independent third party sources or recent transactions in similar securities  or internally prepared valuations incorporating standard valuation techniques 
certain market conditions that could impact the valuation of securities include credit ratings  business climate  economic environment  industry trends  and regulatory and legal risks events  among others 
all such investments are classified as available for sale 
our ability to liquidate our positions in these securities will be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market  and we may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities  our key assumptions about the risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors may not be realized in the event of an actual sale 
securities are also reviewed to identify potential impairments 
in determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost is other than temporary referred to as otti  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples and other key measures for our investments in marketable equity securities and debt instruments 
for fixed maturity securities  our intent and ability to hold securities is also considered 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period net income to the extent of the decline 
for additional information regarding our evaluation of otti  see the section titled investments impairment 
investments in mortgage loans  real estate  policy loans and other investments are monitored for possible impairment 
if it is determined that collection of all amounts due under the contractual terms is doubtful or carrying values exceed the fair value of underlying collateral  such investments are considered impaired and the asset carrying value is adjusted or a valuation allowance is established 
accounting for derivatives we hold derivative financial instruments to hedge growth in policyowner liabilities for certain protection and accumulation products and to hedge market risk for fixed income investments 
these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting or are considered economic hedges as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
hedge accounting results when we designate and document the hedging relationships involving derivative instruments 
economic hedging instruments are those instruments whose change in fair value acts as a natural hedge against the change in fair value of hedged assets or liabilities with both changes wholly or partially being offset in earnings 
to hedge equity market risk  we primarily use s p index call options to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as provided by our equity indexed products 
we may also use interest rate swaps or options to manage our fixed products risk profile 
generally  credit default swaps are coupled with a bond to synthetically create an instrument cheaper than an equivalent investment traded in the cash market 

table of contents we have not changed our methods of calculating the fair values of derivatives or the underlying assumptions 
the fair values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
our derivative instruments are not subject to a multiple or use of leverage on the underlying price index 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate or equity hedges as the counterparties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
information about the fair values  notional amounts  and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements and the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
amortization of dac and voba we generally amortize dac based on a percentage of our expected gross margins egms over the life of the policies 
our estimated egms are computed based on assumptions related to the underlying policies written  including the lives of the underlying policies  growth rate of the assets supporting the liabilities  and level of expenses necessary to maintain the policies over their entire life 
we amortize dac by estimating the present value of the egms over the lives of the insurance policies and then calculate a percentage of the policy acquisition cost deferred as compared to the present value of the egms 
that percentage is used to amortize the dac such that the amount amortized over the life of the policies results in a constant percentage of amortization when related to the actual and future gross margins 
because the egms are only an estimate of the profits we expect to recognize from these policies  the egms are adjusted annually to take into consideration the actual gross profits to date and any changes in the remaining expected future gross margins 
when egms are adjusted  we also adjust the amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs amount to maintain a constant percentage over the entire life of the policies 
we amortize the voba based on the incidence of the egms from insurance contracts using the interest rate credited to the underlying policies 
the egms are based on actuarially determined projections of future premium receipts  mortality  surrenders  operating expenses  changes in insurance liabilities  investment yields on the assets retained to support the policy liabilities and other factors 
these projections take into account all factors known or expected by management 
the actual gross margins may vary from expected levels due to differences in renewal premium  investment spread  investment gains or losses  mortality and morbidity costs and other factors 
investment portfolio general we maintain a diversified portfolio of investments which is supervised by an experienced in house staff of investment professionals 
sophisticated asset liability management techniques are employed in order to achieve competitive yields  while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
the asset portfolio is segmented by liability type  with tailored investment strategies for specific product lines 
investment policies and significant individual investments are subject to approval by the board of directors and are overseen by the investment and risk management committee of our board of directors 
management regularly monitors individual assets and asset groups  in addition to monitoring the overall asset mix 
in addition  the investment and risk management committee review investment guidelines and monitor internal controls 
investment strategy our investment philosophy is to employ an integrated asset liability management approach with separate investment portfolios for specific product lines  such as traditional life  universal life  equity indexed life  traditional annuities  equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and funding agreements to generate attractive risk adjusted returns on capital 
essential to this philosophy is coordinating investments in the investment portfolio with product strategies  focusing on risk adjusted returns and identifying and evaluating associated business risks 

table of contents investment strategies have been established based on the specific characteristics of each product line 
the portfolio investment strategies establish asset duration  quality and other guidelines 
analytical systems are utilized to establish an optimal asset mix for each line of business 
we seek to manage the asset liability mismatch and the associated interest rate risk through active management of the investment portfolio 
financial  actuarial  investment  product development and product marketing professionals work together throughout the product development  introduction and management phases to jointly develop and implement product features  initial and renewal crediting strategies  and investment strategies based on extensive modeling of a variety of factors under a number of interest rate scenarios 
invested assets our diversified portfolio of investments includes public and private fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans 
our objective is to maintain a high quality  diversified fixed maturity securities portfolio that produces a yield and total return that supports the various product line liabilities and our earnings goals

table of contents derivatives interest rate swaps and options are primarily used to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and to manage duration mismatches 
call options are primarily used to hedge equity indexed products 
credit default swaps are coupled with a bond to synthetically create an investment cheaper than the equivalent instrument traded in the cash market 
although we are subject to the risk that counterparties will fail to perform  credit standings of counterparties are monitored regularly 
we only enter into transactions with counterparties rated at least aa or for which a collateral agreement is in place 
we are also subject to the risk associated with changes in the value of contracts 
however  such adverse changes in value generally are offset by changes in the value of the items being hedged 
the notional principal amounts of the swaps and options  which represent the extent of our involvement in such contracts but not the risk of loss  at december   amounted to  million 
the interest rate swaps had a carrying value of a net receivable position of million at december  the credit default swaps had a carrying value of a net receivable position of million at december  the carrying value of options amounted to million at december  for each of these derivatives  the carrying value is equal to fair value as of december  the derivatives are reflected as other investments on the consolidated financial statements 
the net amount payable or receivable from interest rate and credit default swaps are accrued as an adjustment to interest income

structured securities arrangements we hold investments in indexed debt instruments idis in which the principal is initially partially defeased by an obligation of a third party financial institution institution collateralized by us treasuries which will accrete to of the original principal amount of the idis at maturity 
the balance of the principal amount due at maturity is subject to a dynamic defeasance mechanism  which should provide a return of the initial investment 
the instruments issued by the institutions are linked to the performance of a hedge fund or fund of funds 
the annual income on these investments will be equal to the quarterly distribution of the hedge fund or fund of funds plus the change in the present value of anticipated distributions to be received at maturity and will be included in net investment income 
over the life of the idis  the income will be a 
table of contents function of the cumulative performance of the linked hedge fund or fund of funds and the return on any defeased portion of the investment 
the quarterly distribution paid  if any  reduces the amount of future participation in the performance of the linked hedge fund or fund of funds 
at maturity  the company will take delivery of the referenced hedge fund interests and cash or us treasuries equal to the portion of the instruments that have been defeased  the total of which should equal or exceed the instruments principal amount 
the investment purpose of these instruments is to enable the company to obtain the return as if they had invested in hedge funds or fund of funds with dynamic principal protection 
the instruments as of december  carried an a rating or better by fitch 
the carrying value of idis was million and million at december  and  respectively 
impairments our evaluation of otti s for fixed income securities follows a three step process screen and identify  assess and document  recommend and approve 
in identifying potential otti s  we screen for all securities that have a fair value less than of amortized cost 
in addition  we monitor securities for general credit issues that have been identified and included on a watch list which may result in the potential impairment list including other securities that have a fair value at or greater than of amortized cost 
for asset backed securities  an impairment loss is established if the fair value of the security is less than amortized cost and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously projected 
the list of securities identified is subject to a formal assessment to determine if an impairment is other than temporary 
management makes certain assumptions or judgments in its assessment of potentially impaired securities including but not limited to industry characteristics and trends  company to industry profile  quality of management financial conditions and trends including strength of balance sheet and financial liquidity significant events affecting the company and or industry viability of the business model incorporating an evaluation of default probability and associated recoverable value length of time the fair value was below of amortized cost ability and intent to retain the investment to maturity or for a sufficient period of time for it to recover if the determination is that the security is otti  it is written down to fair value 
the write down is reviewed and approved by senior management 
the difference between amortized cost and fair value is charged to net income 
when actively traded market prices are not available  fair values are determined using present value or other standard valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and asset valuations 
the fair value determinations are made at a specific point in time based on then available market information and judgments about the financial instruments 
factors considered in determining fair value include coupon rate  term  collateral if any  industry sector outlook  credit rating  expectations regarding going concern status  timing and amounts of expected future cash flows among other factors 
there are risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring impairments and determining if an impairment is otti 
risks may include the credit characteristics change affecting the creditor s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations  the economic outlook may be worse than expected or impact the credit more than anticipated  accuracy of information provided by issuers could affect valuations  and new information may change our intent to hold the security to maturity 
any of these items could result in a charge to net income in the future

this may include required exposure reductions due to internal credit limits  total rate of return strategies  capital reserve objectives  asset allocation decisions and hedging activities 
however  no decisions have been made as of december   which result in material losses 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the consolidated results of operations 
interest rate changes may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of the protection products and accumulation products offered 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuities or life insurance products offered by competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds  and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of our products until we increase the interest rate credited to owners of our protection products and accumulation products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  we attempt to adjust credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in reinvestment rates 
we monitor interest rates and sell annuities and life insurance policies that permit flexibility to make interest rate changes as part of management of interest spreads 
however  the profitability of our products is based upon persistency  mortality and expenses  as well as interest rate spreads 
we manage our investment portfolio in part to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and net investment income increases or decreases in a direct relationship with interest rate changes 
we have developed an asset liability management approach with separate investment portfolios for major product lines such as traditional life  universal life  equity indexed life  traditional annuities  equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and funding agreements 
investment strategies have been established based on the specific characteristics of each product line 
the portfolio investment strategies establish asset duration  quality and other guidelines 
analytical systems are utilized to establish an optimal asset mix for each line of business 
we seek to manage the asset liability mismatch and the associated interest rate risk through active management of the investment portfolio 
financial  actuarial  investment  product development and product marketing professionals work together throughout the product development  introduction and management phases to jointly develop and implement product features  initial and renewal crediting strategies  and 
table of contents investment strategies based on extensive modeling of a variety of factors under a number of interest rate scenarios 
in force reserves and the assets allocated to each segment are modeled on a regular basis to analyze projected cash flows under a variety of economic scenarios 
the result of this modeling is used to modify asset allocation  investment portfolio duration and renewal crediting strategies 
we invest in derivatives to hedge against the effects of interest rate fluctuations or to hedge growth in policyowner liabilities for certain life and annuity products and funding agreements 
for a further discussion and disclosure of the nature and extent of the use of derivatives  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
federal income tax matters generally  amerus group and our non life subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
the life insurance subsidiaries file separate federal income tax returns  except for ilic and bankers life which together began filing a consolidated tax return in the separate return method is used to compute the provision for allocating federal income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences among the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws 
emerging accounting matters sop effective january   the company adopted statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain non traditional long duration insurance contracts and for separate accounts  sop issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants 
the adoption of sop resulted in establishing additional policy reserve liabilities for fees charged for insurance benefit features which are assessed in a manner that is expected to result in profits in earlier years and losses in subsequent years 
the total effect of adopting sop including reinsurance recoverables as of january   amounted to a decrease of million million after tax in net income which has been reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
the basic and diluted earnings per common share for the change in accounting amounted to for in addition  the adoption of sop established guidance for the accounting and presentation of costs related to sales inducements 
there was no change to the company s method of accounting for sales inducements  however  the capitalized costs are now separately disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet and the related amortization expense is included in policyowner benefits in the consolidated statement of income 
prior to  the capitalized costs were included in dac and the amortization expense was included in the amortization of dac 
the amounts have been reclassified to conform with the presentation 
eitf in march  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached a final consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  eitf 
eitf established impairment models for determining whether to record impairment losses associated with investments in certain equity and debt securities 
it also required income to be accrued on a level yield basis following an impairment of debt securities  where reasonable estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows can be made 
eitf indicated that  although not presumptive  a pattern of selling investments prior to the forecasted recovery may call into question an investor s intent to hold the security until its value recovers 
eitf was to be effective for reporting periods beginning after june   however  in september  the effective date of these provisions was delayed until the finalization of a fasb staff position fsp to provide further guidance on this topic 

table of contents eitf in september  the eitf reached a final consensus on issue  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  eitf 
eitf requires that contingently convertible debt be included in diluted earnings per share  if dilutive  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
the eitf is effective for periods ending after december  with the determination of the dilutive effect upon adoption to be based on the form of the instrument as it existed at the end of the quarter of adoption 
this eitf applied to our oceans 
during the fourth quarter of  we exchanged the oceans which changed the security s conversion provisions 
previously  the oceans were to all be converted to shares of our common stock  however  the exchanged oceans provide for cash to be paid equal to the accreted principal value and shares of our common stock issued for the conversion value in excess of the accreted principal amount 
we applied the restatement provisions of eitf based on the new form of the exchanged oceans which resulted in no change in previously reported diluted earnings per share for or fsp in june  the fasb issued financial staff position fas  situations in which paragraphs of fasb statement no 
permit or require accrual of an unearned revenue liability  fsp 
fsp clarifies that sop did not restrict the recording of a liability for unearned revenue as defined in accordance with paragraphs b and of sfas  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments  to only those situations where profits are followed by expected losses 
fsp was effective for periods beginning after june  the adoption of fsp did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in fsp in may  the fasb issued financial staff position fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  fsp 
fsp requires sponsors of a post retirement health care plan that provides retiree prescription drug benefit to reflect the provisions of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the medicare act in determining post retirement benefit cost for the first annual or interim period beginning after june  we have determined that the drug benefits provided under our post retirement benefits program for medicare eligible retirees are not actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by the medicare act  and therefore we will not be eligible to receive the federal subsidy 
as a result  there was no effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in sfas r in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas  share based payment  sfas r which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  sfas 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on fair values 
pro forma disclosure of fair value information is no longer an alternative 
the statement is effective in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  adoption is to be made using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
the modified prospective method recognizes cost based on the requirements for all share based payments granted after the effective date and for awards granted prior to the effective date that remain unvested prior to the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method but also permits restatement of financial statements based on pro forma amounts previously recognized under sfas restatement can either be for all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
early adoption is permitted 
we continue to evaluate the impacts and timing of adopting sfas r 
we currently disclose the pro forma impacts of recognizing fair value as permitted by sfas in note to the consolidated financial statements 
that disclosure reflects our estimate of expense for share based payments of approximately million after tax 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios and our insurance subsidiaries are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including asset liability management  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risks related to our financial instruments primarily relate to the investment portfolio  which exposes us to risks related to interest rates  credit quality and prepayment variation 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
management views these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability management 
actuarial professionals estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily lapses  to determine duration  which is the present value of the fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which management believes mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk 
for variable and equity indexed products  profitability on the portion of the policyowner s account balance invested in the fixed general account option  if any  is also affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited to the policies 
for the variable products  the policyholder assumes essentially all the investment earnings risk for the portion of the account balance invested in the separate accounts 
for the equity indexed products  we purchase primarily call options that are designed to match the return owed to contract holders who elect to participate in one or more market indices 
profitability on the portion of the equity indexed products tied to market indices is significantly impacted by the spread on interest earned on investments and the sum of the cost of underlying call options purchased to match the returns owed to contract holders and the minimum interest guarantees owed to the contract holder  if any 
profitability on the equity indexed products is also impacted by changes in the fair value of the embedded option which provides the contract holder the right to participate in market index returns after the next anniversary date of the contract 
this impacts profitability as we primarily purchase one year call options to fund the returns owed to the contract holders at the inception of each contract year 
this practice matches with the contract holders rights to switch to different indices on each anniversary date 
the value of the forward starting options embedded in the equity indexed products can fluctuate with changes in assumptions as to future volatility of the market indices  risk free interest rates  market returns and the lives of the contracts 

table of contents the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments and mortgage loans for both our trading and other than trading portfolios at december  the table presents amortized cost and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the amortized cost approximates the cash flows of principal amounts in each of the periods 
the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
expected cash flows expected cash fair thereafter flows value fixed maturity securities available for sale average interest rate fixed maturity securities held for trading purposes average interest rate mortgage loans average interest rate total in accordance with our strategy of minimizing credit quality risk  we consistently invest in high quality marketable securities 
fixed maturity securities are comprised of us treasury  government agency  mortgage backed and corporate securities 
approximately of fixed maturity securities are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or are rated a or better by moody s  standard and poor s  or the naic 
less than of the bond portfolio is below investment grade 
fixed maturity securities have an average life of approximately years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within the portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
management monitors such risk regularly 
we invest primarily in those classes of mortgage backed securities that have average or lower prepayment risk 
our use of derivatives is generally limited to hedging purposes and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps  options and futures 
these instruments  viewed separately  subject us to varying degrees of market and credit risk 
however when used for hedging  the expectation is that these instruments would reduce overall market risk 
credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties may fail to perform under the terms of the contracts 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our derivative positions 
equity price risk is the potential loss arising from changes in the value of equity securities 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio
