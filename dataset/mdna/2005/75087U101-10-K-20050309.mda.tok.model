general our results of operations depend primarily on revenue generated as a result of our net interest income and non interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets consisting primarily of loans and investment securities and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of customer savings and money market accounts  time deposits and borrowed funds 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit and loan accounts  gains on the sale of loans and investments  loan servicing fees  and investment and insurance commissions 
our results of operations are also affected by our provisions for loan losses and non interest expenses 
non interest expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  occupancy  equipment  data processing  marketing  automated teller machine costs and  when applicable  deposit insurance premiums

critical accounting estimate management recognizes that loan losses occur over the life of a loan  and that the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s determination of the allowance is based on a number of factors  including the level of non performing loans  loan loss experience  credit concentrations  a review of the quality of the loan portfolio  collateral values and uncertainties in economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is charged against current period operating results and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about future losses on loans  and the impact of a sudden large loss could significantly reduce the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of three key elements the formula allowance  specific allowance  and general allowance 
we review the consumer and residential loan portfolios as pools of loans since no single loan is individually significant 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying a loss percentage factor to the various loan pool types based on past due ratios  historical loss experience  regulatory and internal credit grading and classification systems  and general economic conditions that could affect the collectibility of the portfolio 
these factors may be adjusted for events that are significant in management s judgment as of the evaluation date 
we determine the specific allowance through the evaluation of commercial real estate and commercial business loans for impairment on a pool basis and on an individual basis once a loan is deemed impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information  management determines it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is measured by the difference between the recorded investment in the loan including accrued interest and net deferred loan fees or costs and the estimated present value of total expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective rate  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount by which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds either the present value of expected future cash flows or the value of the impaired loan s collateral  when applicable  would be a specifically allocated reserve for loan losses 
any portion of an impaired loan classified as loss under regulatory guidelines is charged off 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the general allowance include loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  governmental regulatory actions  recent loss experience in a particular segments of the portfolio and the duration of the current business cycle 
the general allowance addresses risks in the portfolio that are not specifically associated with a pool or individual loan but exist due to changes in economic conditions  rapid loan portfolio growth  changes in credit underwriting  weakness in specific loan markets  unseasoned nature of loan portfolio  and new loan products 
our asset liability management committee primarily consisting of senior management reviews and analyzes the loan portfolio  charges offs  and allowance on a quarterly basis 
management then discusses the development and calculation of this critical accounting estimate with the loan and investment committee of our board of directors 
during  the majority of the audit committee members were also members of the loan and investment committee 
the audit committee of our board of directors also reviews the company s disclosures including this critical accounting estimate 
we reviewed and evaluated the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance at december  and believe that the allowance is adequate for the risk inherent in the loan portfolio considering the growth  unseasoned loans  and the current economic environment 
in the review  we determined that the allowance was adequate at of gross loans  or million 
the allowance was of gross loans or million at december  in  the loan portfolio grew to million at december  from million at december  the strong portfolio growth in the last few years has resulted in a relatively unseasoned loan portfolio which has the potential for increased loan losses 
the loan portfolio has experienced substantial growth especially in multi family and commercial real estate loans 
at december   the multi family and commercial real estate portfolios totaled million up from million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in september  the bank started making one to four family real estate construction loans and as of december   real estate construction loans totaled million 
the increase in the allowance is primarily attributable to the substantial growth in the loan portfolio and the somewhat unseasoned nature of significant portions of the portfolio  which have occurred in an improving economic environment 
the bank recorded net charge offs of million  million  million  million and million during the years ended december     and  respectively 
consumer loans including home equity totaled million or of the loan portfolio at december  consumer loans  including home equity loans  account for essentially all of the bank s charge offs 
based on historical trends and underwriting standards  we anticipate charge offs to be similar or moderate slightly in compared to levels  as the consumer loan portfolio declines in both percentage and dollar terms 
the provision for loan losses has fluctuated depending on the growth of the loan portfolio and the level of charge offs  especially during weak economic times 
the provision for loan losses was million  million  million  million and million for the years ended    and  respectively 
if management s estimate of the allowance deviated by plus or minus then the million allowance would either decrease to million or increase to million 
the provision for loan losses would then subsequently decrease or increase by million 
accordingly  net income would increase or decrease by million after federal income taxes 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting principles are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment than do our other significant accounting policies detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
allowance for loan losses 
the company reviews historical origination and charge off relationships  charge off experience factors  collection data  delinquency reports  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions and trends and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to the appropriateness of the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses 
loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the company repossesses the collateral or the account is otherwise deemed uncollectible 
the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed the estimates 
investments 
the company classifies its investments as either available for sale or held to maturity 
available for sale securities are reported at their fair value  which is determined by obtaining quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income and excluded from earnings 
realized gains and losses and declines in fair value judged to be other than temporary are included in earnings 
the fair value of financial instruments is discussed in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
long lived assets and intangibles 
the company periodically assesses the impairment of its long lived assets and intangibles using judgment as to the effects of external factors  including market conditions 
judgment is also required in projecting future operating results 
if actual external conditions and future operating results differ from the company s judgments  impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of these assets to the appropriate market value 
accrued taxes 
the company estimates tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  general 
total assets increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase reflects growth in our net loan portfolio of million to million from million  and an increase of million in premises and equipment  net

assets 
our net loan portfolio increased million or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in loans secured by the real estate loan portfolio 
the largest contributors were the non residential commercial real estate portfolio which increased million  or  from million to million and the multi family real estate portfolio which increased million  or  from million to million 
other increases in the loan portfolio were generated in the real estate construction portfolio which increased million  or  to million from million  and the commercial business loan portfolio which increased million  or  to million from million 
these increases in the portfolio were partially offset by declines in the consumer loan portfolio of million  or  to million from million  and one to four family residential loans which decreased million  or  to million from million 
our investment securities portfolio including mortgage backed securities decreased slightly by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  mortgage backed securities increased million and bank trust preferred securities million  while corporate securities declined million

our deposit mix at the end of the year included of relatively stable low cost checking  savings  money market  and individual retirement accounts 
borrowings 
federal home loan bank of seattle advances increased million to million at december  from million at december  we used the borrowed funds primarily for both short and long term funding of loans and investment securities  as part of our capital and interest rate risk management strategies 
we borrow funds from the federal home loan bank of seattle to fund attractive loan and investment opportunities and to increase interest earning assets and enhance earnings in connection with leveraging capital to increase our net interest income 
capital 
total shareholders equity decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  our capital to assets ratio under generally accepted accounting principles was at december  compared to at december  the decrease in our capital and capital to assets ratio was a result of the decline in shareholders equity year over year  combined with our increase in total assets

non interest income 
our non interest income increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily a result of an increase in gain on sale of premises and equipment of  and an increase in deposit service fees of  somewhat offset by a decline in the gain on sale of loans of  non interest expense

asset and liability management and market risk general 
rainier pacific bank s board of directors has established an asset liability management policy to guide management in managing the differences in terms between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities while maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity  capital adequacy  interest rate sensitivity  credit risk  and profitability 
the policy includes the use of an asset liability management committee whose members primarily consist of the members of senior management 
the committee s purpose is to communicate  coordinate and manage our asset liability positions consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability management committee meets twice a month to review various areas including economic conditions  interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs  asset liability mix  interest rate risk sensitivity  current market opportunities to promote specific products  loan and deposit product pricing  historical financial results  projected financial results  and capital position 
the committee members frequently meet on an ad hoc basis in between regularly scheduled meetings particularly during periods of highly volatile economic conditions to discuss dynamic and timely tactical actions regarding loan portfolio allocations  investment securities positioning  borrowing opportunities  and product features and pricing changes 
the tactical actions and related changes are generally taken in a very timely manner in order to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace  and are done so in the context of the long term strategic direction established by the board of directors 
risks to us when interest rates change 
one of our primary financial objectives is to generate ongoing profitability 
the largest contributor to our profitability is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the income we receive on loans and investments and the costs we pay on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that rainier pacific bank holds  as well as the associated yields and costs 
the asset liability management policy and committee guide management in managing rainier pacific bank s performance 
a summary of the asset and liability management committee activities is reported to our board of directors monthly and in more detail to the loan and investment committee of the board on a quarterly basis 
some of the principal strategies that we employ to manage our interest rate sensitivity include selling long term fixed rate mortgage loans  borrowing intermediate to long term funds at fixed rates  originating consumer and income property loans with shorter maturities or at variable rates  purchasing securities with shorter maturities  appropriately modifying loan and deposit pricing to capitalize on the then current market opportunities  and increasing core deposits  such as savings  checking and money market accounts  in order to reduce our reliance on the traditionally higher cost  more rate sensitive certificates of deposit 
how we measure the risk of interest rate changes 
we monitor the bank s interest rate sensitivity on a monthly basis through the use of income simulations using internally managed forecasting software and we measure our interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis through a service offered by the federal home loan bank of seattle 
management uses various assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of our operations to changes in interest rates 
although management believes these assumptions are reasonable  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from these assumptions 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities lag behind changes in market interest rates 
non uniform changes and fluctuations in market interest rates across various maturities will also affect the results presented 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed 
the assumptions we use are based upon a combination of proprietary and market data that reflect historical results and current market conditions 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  prepayments  deposit decay rates and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios 
we use market data from the federal home loan bank of seattle to determine prepayments and maturities of loans  investments and borrowings  and use our own assumptions on deposit decay rates except for time deposits 
time deposits are modeled to reprice to market rates upon their stated maturities 
we also assume that non maturity deposits can be maintained with rate adjustments not directly proportionate to the change in market interest rates  based upon our historical deposit decay rates which are substantially lower than market decay rates 
we have demonstrated in the past that the tiering structure of our deposit accounts during changing rate environments results in relatively lower volatility and less than market rate changes in our interest expense for deposits 
we tier our deposit accounts by balance and rate  whereby higher balances within an account earn higher rates of interest 
therefore  deposits that are not very rate sensitive generally  lower balance tiers are separated from deposits that are rate sensitive generally  higher balance tiers 
when interest rates rise  we do not have to raise interest rates proportionately on less rate sensitive accounts to retain these deposits 
these assumptions are based upon our analysis of our customer base  competitive factors and historical experience 
the following table illustrates the change in the bank s net interest income at december  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
net interest income basis point change in rates amount change change dollars in thousands represents the decrease of the estimated net interest income at the indicated change in interest rates compared to net interest income assuming no change in interest rates 
changes in rates for minus negative and basis points were not included because many interest rates would become negative and are not indicative of a realistic interest rate scenario 
the following table illustrates the change in the net portfolio value at december  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest movement 
net portfolio as of net portfolio value portfolio value of assets basis point market value change in rates amount change change npv ratio change of assets dollars in thousands the net portfolio value is calculated based upon the present value of the discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
the difference between the present value of assets and liabilities is the net portfolio value and represents the market value of equity for the given interest rate scenario 
net portfolio value is useful for determining  on a market value basis  how much equity changes in response to various interest rate scenarios 
large changes in net portfolio value reflect increased interest rate sensitivity and generally more volatile earnings streams 
represents the decrease or increase in the estimated net portfolio value at the indicated change in interest rates compared to the net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates 
calculated as the net portfolio value divided by the market value of assets net portfolio value ratio 
calculated as the decrease or increase in the net portfolio value ratio assuming the indicated change in interest rates over the estimated net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates 
market value of assets is calculated based on the present value of the discounted cash flows from assets 
the market value of assets represents the value of assets under the various interest rate scenarios and reflects the sensitivity of those assets to interest rate changes 
changes in rates for minus negative and basis points were not included because many interest rates would be negative and not indicative of a realistic interest rate scenario 
interest rates are close to historically low levels with most deposit rates below 
if interest rates were to rapidly decline from these historical lows  we may not be able to reduce the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds interest bearing liabilities as rapidly as the decline we may experience on the rates we earn on loans and investments interest earning assets 
the difference between the rate we earn on our interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities is referred to as interest rate spread 
when interest rates decline by basis points  our net interest income decreases because the rate we earn on our interest earning assets gradually decreases slower than the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities due to their generally short term repricing characteristics 
interest income would gradually decrease on our interest earning assets because of their relatively longer term structure and increased prepayment risks would emerge 
however  because current interest rates are low  the rate we pay on the majority of our deposits cannot decline basis points since most rates are already below the level 
in addition  our intermediate term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of seattle do not immediately reprice when interest rates decline 
because of the low rate environment  our interest rate spread narrows and so does our net interest income when rates decline basis points or more 
when interest rates rise by   or basis points  our net interest income and the net portfolio value decreases because the rate we earn on our interest earning assets does not increase as rapidly as the rates we would pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
our interest earning assets primarily consist of intermediate term and longer term loans that do not reprice quickly and investments with primarily intermediate term structures 
our interest bearing liabilities generally consist of short term deposits savings  money market  and certificates of deposits and short to intermediate term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of seattle that would reprice more quickly than our interest earning assets 
the net interest income and net portfolio value tables presented above are predicated upon a stable balance sheet with no growth or change in asset or liability mix 
in addition  the net portfolio value is based upon the present value of discounted cash flows using the federal home loan bank of seattle s and our estimates of current replacement rates to discount the cash flows 
the effects of changes in interest rates in the net interest income table are based upon a cash flow simulation of our existing assets and liabilities and  for purposes of simplifying the analysis  assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
delinquency rates may change when interest rates change  as a result of changes in the loan portfolio mix  underwriting conditions  loan terms  or changes in economic conditions that have a delayed effect on the portfolio 
the model we use that is administered by the federal home loan bank of seattle does not change the delinquency rate for the various interest rate scenarios 
even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as set forth above 
also  a change in the us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve would cause changes to the net portfolio value and net interest income other than those indicated above 
liquidity and commitments we actively analyze and manage rainier pacific bank s liquidity with the objectives of maintaining an adequate level of liquidity and to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to support loan growth  fund deposit withdrawals  fund operations and satisfy other financial commitments 
see consolidated statements of cash flows contained in the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
our primary sources of funds are from customer deposits  loan repayments  loan sales  maturing investment securities and advances from the federal home loan bank of seattle 
these funds  together with retained earnings and equity  are used to make loans  acquire investment securities and other assets  and fund continuing operations 
while maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we believe that our current liquidity position and our forecasted operating results are sufficient to fund all of our existing commitments 
the board of directors established liquidity requirements within our asset and liability management policy to guide management in maintaining adequate liquidity 
our policy requires rainier pacific bank to maintain adequate lines of credit in an amount equal to at least of deposits 
we can borrow for liquidity  loan and investment opportunities  and to enhance our interest rate risk management 
our policy requires rainier pacific bank to maintain at least five percent of assets available in an unused line of credit and of assets in the combination of an unused line of credit  interest bearing deposits  available for sale investment securities  and readily saleable loans 
at december   we maintained a line of credit with the federal home loan bank of seattle equal to of total assets  with an unused portion of the line of credit amounting to of total bank assets 
this line of credit depends on us having sufficient collateral to pledge to the federal home loan bank of seattle 
at december   we were in compliance with our collateral requirements  and of our line of credit with the federal home loan bank of seattle was available 
in addition  we had of total assets available through unused lines of credit  interest bearing deposits  available for sale investments  and readily saleable loans available for liquidity purposes  which is slightly below our internal requirement of 
management took action in january to increase our liquidity above 
at december   certificates of deposits amounted to million  or of total deposits  including million that are scheduled to mature by december  historically  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our deposits as they mature 
at times  we have also elected to borrow from the federal home loan bank of seattle and price certificates of deposit at below market rates to let these non core deposits decline in order to reprice the non core portion of the deposit portfolio quicker 
once the repricing objective has been met  we return our deposit pricing to market rates and recover the lost deposit volume 
management believes that we have adequate resources to fund all loan commitments through deposits  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of seattle  and the sale of mortgage loans or investments 
management also believes that we can adjust the offering rates of savings certificates to retain  increase  or decrease deposits in changing interest rate environments 
at december   we had million of net unrealized losses on securities classified as available for sale  or of the million carrying value of the related securities 
movements in market interest rates will affect the unrealized gains and losses on these securities 
however  assuming that the securities are held to their individual dates of maturity  even in periods of increasing market interest rates  as the securities approach their dates of maturity  the unrealized gain or loss will begin to decrease and eventually be eliminated 
capital resources consistent with our objective to operate a sound and profitable financial institution  we have maintained and will continue to focus on maintaining a well capitalized rating from regulatory authorities 
in addition  we are subject to certain capital requirements set by our regulatory agencies 
as of december   the bank was classified as a well capitalized institution under the criteria established by the fdic and exceeded all capital requirements 
total equity for the bank was million at december   or of total assets on that date 
the bank s regulatory capital ratios at december  were as follows tier leverage of  tier risk based capital of  and total risk based capital of 
we purchased approximately  square feet of property in downtown tacoma in two phases in and to construct a mixed use office retail building 
in december  the building construction was substantially complete and the company relocated its corporate and administrative offices to the new downtown tacoma location 
capitalized expenditures for the building  improvements  furniture  and equipment related to this project primarily account for the million increase in total premises and equipment 
this capital investment directly reduces our net interest income  and this reduction is not projected to be offset by positive cash flows from the building until at least our financial projections for the building incorporate assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable in light of the current market conditions for class a office retail space and the current condition of the local economy 
in light of these factors  our projections assume that the project will not reach a stabilized occupancy rate of until july in addition  the projections incorporate rental rates slightly below those currently being offered by comparable class a properties in downtown tacoma 
based upon our projections  the positive cash flows generated from the building at the projected stabilized occupancy rate will exceed the loss of net interest earnings from the capital investment  and will partially offset the related depreciation expenses associated with the building 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  the company enters into contractual obligations that meet various business needs 
these contractual obligations include time deposits to customers  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of seattle  lease obligations for facilities  and contracts or lease agreements to build facilities or construct tenant improvements for other tenants 
in total we expect to spend million in lease obligations to tenants  of which million is not a contractual obligation 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information 
the following table summarizes the company s long term contractual obligations at december  less than one year one to three years three to five years thereafter total in thousands time deposits    long term borrowings      operating lease obligations   lease obligations tenant improvements  total  off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company makes off balance sheet arrangements  including credit commitments to its customers to meet their financial needs 
these arrangements involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the bank makes personal  commercial  and real estate lines of credit available to customers but does not issue stand by letters of credit or financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit to customers are subject to the bank s normal credit policies and are essentially the same as those involved in extending loans to customers 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturities structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation on earnings  as distinct from levels of interest rates  is in the area of non interest expense 
expense items such as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
management is unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements during  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued the following accounting standards related to the financial services industry on december   fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement no 
however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july   and we expect to adopt the statement on that date 
the company plans to adopt statement r using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method as detailed in apb opinion no 
and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot yet be predicted due to all implementation issues not being resolved or clarified at this time
