results of operations on august   our board of directors decided to change our fiscal year from august to december the following table presents our results of operations  including the transition period indicated 
results for the four months ended december  and for the twelve months ended december  are unaudited and are presented for comparison purposes 
operating results as a percent of net sales four months four months year ended year ended ended ended december  december  december  december  year ended august  net sales       gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating loss income interest expense loss income before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle year ended december  versus the year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  of million decreased from sales of million for the year ended december  net sales in the hvacr segment of million in decreased from million in as a result of much cooler than normal summer weather in key north american markets  causing a very poor retail sales environment which not only prevented in season sales re orders  but also resulted in customer returns 
lower prices on room air conditioners also contributed to lower sales 
partially offsetting the lower sales of room air conditioners in north america was the growth of residential central air conditioner products globally and sales of all air conditioner products in asia 
sales in the engineered products reporting segment increased by to million in  compared to in  due to growth in industrial air cleaners in asia and north america 
industry wide prices began to increase entering gross profit declined to million  or of net sales  in the year ended december   compared to million  or of net sales in gross profit in the hvacr segment of million  or of net sales in decreased from million  or of net sales in as a result of lower prices on room air conditioners  higher component and raw material costs due to increases in commodity prices  including the loss of a value added tax vat rebate of approximately million  and by unabsorbed manufacturing costs associated with the transfer of production from several us factories to china of million 
gross profit in the engineered products segment of million in increased from million in as a result of increased sales  but gross profit as a percentage of sales of in decreased from in as a result of higher component and raw material costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales in sg a expenses were higher than the prior year as a result of higher selling expenses of million due to increased selling activity globally  and increased warehousing costs of million to support higher inventory caused in part by increased requirements and as a result of the cooler than normal weather conditions in north america 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in administrative expenses 
operating loss for the year ended december  was million  or of net sales  compared to operating profit of million  or of net sales  in the decrease reflects lower sales of room air conditioners in north america  higher material costs  unabsorbed overhead and higher selling and warehousing expenses 
net interest expense increased in to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in interest expense consisted of interest on the company s long term debt  most of which was refinanced during  and interest on short term working capital loans in asia and on the company s revolving credit facility in the us net interest expense was higher than prior year due to higher short term borrowings during the period 
a loss on debt extinguishment of million was recorded during the year ended december  in connection with the extinguishment of the company s ten year notes and the issuance of new ten year notes due march the charge consisted of million of call premiums required to be paid to note holders and million for the write off of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs 
a million credit due to a revision in management s estimates of required restructuring reserves for ongoing projects associated with a restructuring was recorded in net loss applicable to common stockholders in was million  or cents loss per diluted common share 
net income applicable to common stockholders in the year ended december  was million  or cents earnings per diluted common share 
four months ended december  versus the four months ended december  net sales in the four month period ended december  increased by to million  compared to million in the prior year  four month period 
the improvement was the result of an increase of million  or  within the hvacr reporting segment due to increased air conditioner sales in asia and dehumidifier sales in north america 
sales in the engineered products reporting segment of million were essentially flat compared to prior year  as weak sales of commercial and industrial air cleaners in europe and north america were offset by sales growth in asia 
the gross profit in the four month period ended december  was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year  four month period 
the lower gross margin was the result of costs associated with the closing of our air conditioner production plant in georgia and consolidation of the production of commercial air conditioners at our plant in texas 
costs associated with this manufacturing rationalization and redundant overhead costs between the two plants during the period amounted to approximately million 
we also incurred start up and transition costs of approximately million during the period associated with the transfer of production of additional high volume products from the us to china 
margins were also affected during the period due to an increase in sales of lower margin products 
sg a expenses in the four months ended december  were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year four month period 
the sg a expenses in the period included two non recurring charges 
a non cash charge of million was recorded due to the variable accounting treatment associated with the value of re priced stock options to reflect the increase in the market price of our stock 
all of the re priced options were exercised or expired during the period and will have no further effect on sg a expenses in subsequent periods 
a million charge was recorded to account for a tax gross up upon the expiration of restrictions on stock granted pursuant to an employment agreement in october the operating loss in the four months ended december  was million  or of net sales  compared to an operating loss of million  or of net sales  in the prior year  four month period 
net interest expense in the four months ended december  of million was approximately equal to the prior year  four month period and consisted primarily of interest expense on our long term debt 
net interest expense as a percent of net sales was lower than prior year due to the increase in sales 
upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we were required to perform a transitional goodwill impairment test 
the transitional goodwill impairment test was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result  we recognized a non cash transitional goodwill impairment charge of million in our engineered products segment  because the projected financial performance of the engineered products segment was insufficient to support the related goodwill 
as required  the transitional goodwill impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of september  net loss in the four months ended december  applicable to common stockholders  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  was million  compared to a net loss in the four months ended december  applicable to common stockholders  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  of million 
net loss applicable to common stockholders in the four months ended december   including the million non cash transitional goodwill impairment charge  was million 
year ended august  fiscal versus the year ended august  fiscal net sales for fiscal totaled million  an increase of from sales of million in fiscal the sales increase in fiscal reflects a million  or  increase in sales in the hvacr segment to million compared to million in fiscal sales in the hvacr segment increased in all major global markets despite a general decline in pricing 
in the engineered products segment  sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the sales decline was due to continued weak demand in the capital equipment market for commercial and industrial air cleaners 
gross profit improved to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the gross profit percentage was of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decline reflects continued deflationary effects on pricing  overhead absorption variances at engineered products production facilities due to lower production and sales  higher manufacturing engineering costs related to the movement of additional high volume production to asia and start up expenses related to supporting the introduction of new products globally 
sg a expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization expense 
operating income increased in fiscal to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  which included million in goodwill amortization expense 
the increase in operating income reflects higher sales and improved operating leverage within the hvacr segment 
net interest expense decreased in fiscal to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal due to lower borrowing costs on our short term lines of credit 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we were required to perform a transitional goodwill impairment test 
the transitional goodwill impairment test was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result  we recognized a non cash transitional goodwill impairment charge of million in our engineered products segment  because the projected financial performance of the engineered products segment was insufficient to support the related goodwill 
as required  the transitional goodwill impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of september  net income in fiscal applicable to common stockholders before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million compared to net income of million in fiscal net loss applicable to common stockholders in fiscal  including the million non cash transitional goodwill impairment charge  was million 
net income in fiscal benefited from a million reduction in accrued tax liabilities 
the reduction was due to reserves no longer required for federal  state and foreign tax purposes primarily due to favorable audit results and a change in estimate for foreign taxes

net cash provided by operations in fiscal was million  primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset  in part  by increased finished goods inventories 
net inventories at december  were million compared to million at december  the decrease is a result of reduced production of room air conditioners in the fourth quarter of to align inventory levels to lower expected sales of room air conditioners in  as a result of higher inventory levels throughout distribution channels following the cool summer in key north american markets in net inventories at december  were million compared to million at august  the end of fiscal  and million at december  inventories increased during this period due to inventory required to support the expansion of sales of central air conditioners globally and all products in asian markets  as well as to meet us retailers earlier shipment requirements for the season 
net inventories at august   were million  compared to million at the end of fiscal the increase in finished goods was the result of a build up of inventory to support in season sales due to the shift to offshore production of high volume products and to support sales of new products globally 
in the fiscal year ended august   we completed two exchange offers in which a new class of cumulative preferred stock was offered to stockholders in exchange for our common stock 
the exchange offers were intended to provide an opportunity to stockholders interested in a security that will provide significantly higher dividends than the common stock 
the exchange of  shares of common stock for  shares of series a cumulative preferred stock was completed on december   and the exchange of  shares of common stock for  shares of series a cumulative preferred stock was completed on march  subsequently  on two occasions  we distributed transferable rights to our common and class b stockholders entitling them to purchase the series a cumulative preferred stock at a discount to market prices

the new disclosures are generally effective for calendar year end financial statements of public companies  with a delayed effective date for certain disclosures for foreign plans 
the company adopted this statement in december critical accounting estimates and judgments estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
deferred tax assets at december   we had us and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million respectively  for which we recorded a deferred tax asset 
for us to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset  we must achieve future earnings prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we have established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we may need to further adjust that valuation allowance if future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly different from current estimates 
the valuation allowance reflects the uncertainty associated with the realization of deferred tax assets 
the increase in the valuation reserve was due primarily to foreign net operating losses 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group should be assessed 
we assess the carrying amount of the asset or asset group by comparing the carrying amount to the estimate of cash inflows  net of outflows 
if the estimated net cash inflows are less than the asset carrying amount  the asset is written down to fair value 
fair value is based upon quoted market prices  if available 
when quoted market prices are not available  we estimate fair value based upon the selling prices of similar assets or valuation techniques 
we must estimate the net cash inflows to assess an asset or asset group carrying amount and fair value 
estimates are based upon internal budgets and forecasts 
a change in the utilization of the assets or a decision to exit certain product lines or manufacturing locations could impact our estimate of future cash flows 
a decrease in estimated future cash flows could reduce the fair values of long lived assets  increasing the likelihood of impairment  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carry amount 
we have elected to perform the annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of september of each year 
we identify potential goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting segment with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow and market multiple approach 
if the fair value of a reporting segment exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting segment is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of a segment exceeds its fair value  the amount of goodwill impairment loss  if any  must be measured 
we measure the amount of goodwill impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting segment goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting segment goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense 
warranty and defective returns our air conditioner products are covered by standard product warranty plans that extend from one to five years 
in addition  major retailers have consumer return policies that allow consumers the ability to return product that may be defective in lieu of field service 
upon return to us  these units are inspected  repaired as required  reboxed and held for future sale as factory reconditioned products 
a portion of those units returned is not repairable 
at the time revenue is recognized  upon shipment  measurements of those sales are reduced by estimates of the future costs associated with fulfilling warranty obligations and for the expense associated with repairing or scrapping defective returns 
we estimate warranty costs and defective returns utilizing historical failure and defective return rates  which may or may not be indicative of future rates 
the estimate for warranty obligations and defective returns is a critical accounting estimate for the hvacr segment 
over the past three years  warranty and defective return costs represented approximately of sales for the hvacr segment 
each quarter  the estimate of warranty and defective return obligations  including the assumptions about estimated failure and return rates  is reevaluated 
we have discussed the development and selection of this and other critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
end of season returns sales are recorded consistent with their related shipping terms upon the passing of title and the risks and rewards of ownership to the customer 
for a majority of the company s customers  title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass at the time of shipment 
however  certain of the company s sales are recorded at the time the products are delivered to the customers 
sales are recorded net of a provision for sales allowances and returns 
see warranty and defective returns above 
the company estimates a provision for sales allowances and for returns at the time of sale based on consideration of a number of factors including historical experience  customer buying patterns and programs  and information with respect to customer inventory levels 
the company s sales of room air conditioners are seasonal  and  with the exception of certain significant customers  the company generally does not allow its customers the right of return of unsold product at the end of the selling season 
for such significant customers  the company has a process of estimating potential end of season returns based upon a review of customer inventory levels  taking into account actual and expected sell through of product during the summer season 
we have discussed the development and selection of this and other critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors foreign operations are subject to the risks inherent in such activities  such as foreign regulations  unsettled political conditions and exchange rate fluctuations such as the recent revaluation of the chinese currency 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the only activity subject to market risk in which the company engages is hedging exchange rates 
the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
from time to time we engage in hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  we cannot assure that any hedging transactions we enter into will be effective or will not result in foreign exchange hedging loss
