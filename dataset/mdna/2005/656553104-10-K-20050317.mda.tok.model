critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to the annual consolidated financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  known trends in the industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to customers  when title has passed  all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in the normal course of business the company enters into a number of contracts with customers under which we provide engineering services on a per project basis 
revenue for these services is recognized upon completion of the engineering process  usually upon initial shipment of the product 
revenues from repair services are recognized upon shipment of related equipment to customers 
allowance for uncollectible accounts management analyzes accounts receivable  historical write offs of bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for uncollectible accounts may be required 
the company has not experienced significant bad debts expense and the reserve for uncollectible accounts of  is considered adequate for any exposure to loss in the december  accounts receivable 
inventory reserves inventory reserves are maintained for the estimated value of the inventory that may have a lower value than stated or quantities in excess of future production needs 
the company has an evaluation process that is used to assess the value of the inventory that is slow moving  excess or obsolete and is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
management believes the total reserve of million at december  is adequate 
long lived and intangible asset impairment the company evaluates long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the evaluation is based on the company s projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to equal estimated fair value 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the estimates associated with the asset impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes management s estimate of the tax rates utilized in the calculation of the deferred tax balances is based on historical taxable income and expected future taxable income and corresponding rates 
further  management s consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is based upon estimates of taxable income in future periods and future realizability of these assets 
self insured health claim accruals management estimates its reserve for employee health claims based on health claims incurred  historical lag times and an analysis of claims activity during the period  while taking into consideration insurance limits and coverage 
management believes the total accrual of  at december  is adequate 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that the company s consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in materials costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
no matters have come to management s attention since december  that would cause the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements to change materially

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused  for example  by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate and unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the mexican peso 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
the company s financial advisors  both internal and external  provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect management s assessment 
exchange rate sensitivity the company conducts operations in mexico 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates 
the company does not use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the mexico subsidiary s local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of the subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
the company does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on earnings 
interest rate sensitivity the effective interest rate on the company s credit facilities are influenced by the actions of the federal reserve in establishing from time to time the federal funds interest rate which is the rate banks borrow from the federal reserve bank 
during and  the federal reserve implemented a number of reductions in the federal funds interest rate in an effort to stimulate the us economy 
as a result the effective interest rate that the company paid on its borrowings under the facilities declined  leading to a corresponding reduction in interest expense 
however  in the latter half of the federal reserve increased the federal funds interest rate  causing the effective interest rate on the company s facilities to increase 
based on the balance outstanding under our interest bearing facilities at year end  a percentage point change in the effective interest rate would have changed interest expense by approximately  the remainder of this page was intentionally left blank nortech systems incorporated and subsidiary table of contents december    and
