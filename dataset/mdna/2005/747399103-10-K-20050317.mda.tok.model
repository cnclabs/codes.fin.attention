item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
general overview 
quaker is a leading designer  manufacturer and worldwide marketer of woven upholstery fabrics and one of the largest producers of jacquard upholstery fabrics in the world 
the company also manufactures specialty yarns  most of which are used in the production of the company s fabric products 
the balance is sold to manufacturers of craft yarns  home furnishings and other products 
overall demand levels in the upholstery fabric sector are a function of overall demand for household furniture  which is  in turn  affected by general economic conditions  population demographics  new household formations  consumer confidence and disposable income levels  sales of new and existing homes and interest rates 
competition in the industry is intense  from both domestic fabric mills and fabric mills located outside the us manufacturing products for sale into the us market 
in addition  there has been a recent and significant increase in imports of both furniture coverings and fully upholstered furniture into the us market  with industry data indicating that sales of imported fabrics in both roll and kit form represented approximately of total us fabric sales during  up from in and in competition in the us domestic market may further intensify as a result of the january  expiration of the quotas imposed under the uruguay round agreement on textiles and clothing on textile and apparel products coming into the us the company s fabric products compete with other furniture coverings  including leather  suede  microdenier faux suede  prints  tufts  flocks and velvets  for consumer acceptance 
consumer tastes in upholstered furniture coverings are somewhat cyclical and do change over time  with various coverings gaining or losing share depending on changes in home furnishing trends and the amount of retail floor space allocated to various upholstered furniture product categories at any given time 
for example  leather furniture and furniture covered with microdenier faux suede products  primarily imported in roll and kit form from low labor cost countries  particularly china  have enjoyed growing popularity over the past few years  primarily at the expense of woven fabrics  such as the jacquards and other woven fabrics quaker manufactures  and in some retail furniture stores  these products may occupy as much as of the floor space allocated to upholstered furniture products 
quaker s revenues of million and net income of million both set new company records 
during the first half of  quaker s revenues were running at an annualized rate of approximately million  however  global economic conditions deteriorated as the year progressed  ultimately resulting in a weak fourth quarter  with domestic fabric sales down for the quarter and yarn sales off significantly 
the company s backlog position was also down considerably  from million at the end of to million at the end of  due to both significant reductions quaker achieved in its delivery lead times and weakness in the company s fourth quarter order rate 
during  quaker also further strengthened its balance sheet  with the company generating approximately million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter  thereby allowing quaker to reduce funded debt by approximately million during the quarter 
net sales for the week fiscal year ended january  of million were down  with net income of million  down  and diluted earnings per share of 
a refund related to the favorable resolution of a foreign tariff dispute added million of non recurring income to fiscal pre tax income  increasing diluted earnings per share for the year by 
uncertainty surrounding the global economic and geopolitical environment continued to put pressure on the company s fabric sales during  with domestic net fabric sales down and net export sales down versus while the company s yarn revenues were also down  yarn sales for the fourth quarter of million were up versus the comparable period of  primarily as a result of the steps taken during the year to strategically reposition that segment of the company s business 
despite a drop of a little over million in quaker s week revenues for compared to s week fiscal year  the company s gross margin declined only basis points  showing particular improvement in the fourth quarter 
quaker s operating margin  however  was down basis points for the year  largely because of the ongoing costs associated with the strategic investments the company has made to build competitive advantage  particularly in the areas of research and development  product styling and design  and information and supply chain management 
the year over year decrease in the company s revenues caused those investments to push up quaker s sg a as a percentage of revenues results for the year and kept the company from achieving its sg a as a percentage of revenues objectives 
in addition  during  quaker reduced inventory  paid dividends for the first time  generated improved cash flows  and paid down debt ending the year with a net debt to total capitalization ratio of  versus at the end of  further strengthening the company s balance sheet 
recent developments fiscal started out reasonably strong  but the company s financial performance deteriorated as the year progressed  particularly during the second half 
because of the significant investments quaker has made in machinery and equipment over the years  the company s fixed costs are relatively high causing any shortfall at the top line to quickly erode quaker s margins and bottom line profitability 
net sales of million for were down versus with net sales into the domestic residential market of million for the year and million for the fourth quarter  down and  respectively and international fabric sales of million for the year and million for the fourth quarter  down and  respectively 
yarn sales  however  showed consistent strength throughout the year  with total sales into that market of million  up over and reflecting the strategic repositioning of that aspect of quaker s business 
from a profitability standpoint  the company s performance during the first quarter of was solid  with net income of million but the company recorded a small loss in the second quarter  a million loss in the third quarter and a million loss in the fourth quarter leading to a loss of million for the year as a whole  with favorable settlement of a company claim for certain federal research and development tax credits adding approximately million  or per share  to the company s results for the fourth quarter and for the year 
the million drop in quaker s net sales into the domestic residential furniture market in compared to was the single most important factor affecting the company s financial performance during this decline reflects a continuation of intense competition in the domestic market  including competition and pricing pressure from leather  faux suede and other furniture coverings coming into the us from asia 
the current popularity of faux suede at the promotional end of the market and leather at the middle and upper end has reduced the size of the market for the woven jacquard and plain fabrics quaker makes 
last year s lower revenues resulted in a significant deterioration in quaker s margin performance  pushed sg a expense as a percentage of sales up to for the year  and for the fourth quarter and generally hurt the company s financial performance resulting in losses at the bottom line in every quarter except the first 
the problems created by s revenue shortfall were exacerbated by a number of other factors  including higher energy and raw material prices and the more than million of professional fees quaker incurred in connection with its sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts 
the deterioration in the company s financial results led to violations of several of the financial covenants in quaker s principal loan documents and the company sought and received waivers from its two major financing sources to deal with this 
quaker is continuing to work with its lenders to put new loan agreements in place that are consistent with the company s current operating and financing needs 
this process is expected to be completed during the second quarter of last year s cash flow from operations was million  with capital expenditures of million compared to cash flow from operations of million in  with capital expenditures of million in that year 
the company took aggressive action during the second half of to reduce its operating costs 
these actions included staffing reductions intended to reduce overhead and bring production rates in line with demand  and the temporary idling of certain yarn manufacturing equipment as well as the execution of a long term lease on  square feet of additional manufacturing and warehousing space in fall river 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the company began implementing further company wide cost cutting measures intended to reduce annual fixed operating costs by approximately million  and reduced employment levels at the company by an additional production staff employees 
new fabric orders during the fourth quarter of were down approximately versus the comparable period of  and ended with a total production backlog valued at approximately million  down in comparison to million at the end of this drop in the backlog reflects both lower orders during the fourth quarter of last year and quaker s continued efforts to reduce delivery lead times 
in january  an important raw material supplier announced its decision to exit the acrylic business 
over the short term  dealing with this development will increase quaker s raw material costs  put additional pressure on the company s margins and also involve some significant opportunity costs 
the company has placed orders with this supplier to build a safety stock of acrylic inventory at quaker sufficient to cover its manufacturing requirements until raw materials from the new suppliers enter the company s supply chain 
quaker has also moved ahead with some adjustments in its pricing to deal with the pressure placed on the company s margins by the significant raw material and other cost increases affecting its business 
management believes that domestic market conditions are likely to remain both challenging and highly dynamic  with problems at the company s suppliers just one symptom of the broader challenges arising out of the changes taking place in the furniture industry as a whole 
these challenges including rapid changes in the competitive landscape  a significant increase in fabric imports  the emergence of new industry participants  consolidation in the furniture retailing and manufacturing sectors and changes in the kind of furniture consumers want to purchase and in how they want to purchase it will make building the kind of sales volume the company needs a difficult task 
these challenges also place additional importance on the wisdom of quaker s corporate and marketing strategies and the effectiveness of their execution 
in late  quaker arranged to have an in depth market study performed to serve as the basis of a refinement of the company s strategy going forward so that the core competencies the company has developed in the design  technology  supply chain and new product development areas can be used to best advantage to further the company s revenue and profitability objectives 
in the meantime  the company is moving aggressively to build sales in both the domestic and international residential fabric markets 
quaker is also continuing its efforts to grow sales into the contract and specialty yarn markets and is working on a new line of products for the outdoor furniture segment  where the product and service advantages quaker has already developed can be leveraged to generate additional sales 
in addition  quaker intends to begin bringing fabrics into the us market that the company does not have the equipment to make  as a complement to quaker s existing product offerings

fiscal years and contained weeks 
the company follows industry practice by closing its operating facilities for a one to two week period during july of each year 
in  this shutdown period  and the resulting effect on sales  was split between the second and third fiscal quarters 
in  the shutdown period  and the resulting effect on sales  occured in the third fiscal quarter 
product mix 
by offering a broad assortment of fabrics at each price point and in each styling category  the company has positioned itself as a full service supplier of jacquard and plain woven fabrics to the upholstered furniture segment 
while quaker offers a full range of fabrics to its promotional end customers  the company s primary focus is on the development of products for the middle to upper end of the market  where quaker s design  technology and manufacturing expertise provide the company with the greatest competitive advantage 
quaker s product line is divided into three distinct branded collections  with its davol tm  quaker tm  and whitaker r collections intended to meet the styling  design  quality and pricing needs of the promotional  middle to better  and better to upper ends of the market  respectively 
geographic distribution of fabric sales 
to develop markets for upholstery fabric outside the united states  the company has placed substantial emphasis on building both direct exports from the united states as well as on sales from its distribution centers in mexico and brazil 
the following table sets forth certain information about the changes which have occurred in the geographic distribution of the company s net fabric sales since fiscal year percent of percent of percent of amount sales amount sales amount sales in thousands net fabric sales dollars domestic sales    foreign sales    net fabric sales    foreign sales consists of both direct exports from the united states as well as sales from the company s distribution centers in mexico and brazil 
critical accounting policies the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting estimates used by the company 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to accounts receivable reserves  inventory valuation and inventory reserves  self insurance reserves  property  plant and equipment and income taxes 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns and allowances the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by management s review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that credit loss rates in the future will be consistent with those experienced in the past 
the company s accounts receivable are spread among more than  customers and no single customer represented more than and of the accounts receivable balance at january  and january   respectively 
management analyzes historical sales and quality returns  current economic trends  and the company s quality performance when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the reserve for sales returns and allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of the company s net sales for any period if management makes different judgments or uses different estimates 
inventories inventory is valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
approximately of finished goods are produced upon receipt of a firm order 
management  in partnership with key customers  is utilizing forecasting techniques to significantly reduce delivery lead times 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical information and estimated forecasts of product demand and raw material requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in manufacturing costs  including but not limited to overtime and other costs related to capacity constraints in certain areas of the company 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  assumptions used in determining management s estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of management s forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and the company s reported operating results 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for workers compensation and medical insurance 
quaker has purchased stop loss coverage for both types of risks in order to minimize the effect of a catastrophic level of claims 
at the end of each accounting period  the reserves for incurred but not reported claims are evaluated 
management evaluates claims experience on a regular basis in consultation with the company s insurance advisors and makes adjustments to these reserves 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with evaluating the adequacy of self insurance reserves 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of these costs for any period if management makes different judgments or uses different estimates 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
reductions in the useful lives of the company s fixed assets would have an adverse impact on the company s financial results 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that the company recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the company s deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event management were to determine that the company would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should management determine that the company would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company does not provide for united states income taxes on earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states 
the company s intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently 
management believes that united states foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any united states taxes or offset any foreign withholding taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment 
the revised sfas no 
requires that the fair value of stock options be recorded in the results of operations beginning no later than july  upon adoption of the revised standard  prior awards are charged to expense under the prior rules  and awards after adoption are charged to expense under the revised rules 
the company has not determined the effect of the new standard on its earnings  however  expense under the new standard will likely be somewhat higher 
the effect of adopting the new rules on reported diluted earnings per share is dependent on the number of options granted in the future  the terms of those awards and their fair values and  therefore  the effect on diluted earnings per share could change 
the company will adopt the revised rules on july   but has not determined whether it would adopt prospectively  or retrospectively to january  in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement clarifies the accounting for the abnormal amount of idle facilities expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period expense 
in addition the statement requires that allocation of fixed overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred after december  adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the company 
on december   the sec issued sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which supersedes a portion of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
the primary purpose of sab is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  which was superseded as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 

while the wording of sab has changes to reflect the issuance of eitf no 
 the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab did not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for decreased million  or  to million from million in net fabric sales decreased due to decreases in both domestic and foreign fabric sales 
net fabric sales within the united states decreased  to million in from million in  as a result of increased competition from leather  microdenier faux suede and other furniture coverings being imported into the us in roll and kit form  primarily from low labor cost countries in asia 
net foreign sales decreased  to million in from million in this decrease in foreign sales was due primarily to lower sales in mexico  canada and the middle east 
in mexico  the company competes primarily with mexican weavers which typically offer their products at prices lower than the company s 
as a result  the company has lost some market share to lower cost local mills 
in canada  where furniture manufacturers sell furniture into both the united states and canadian markets  competition from faux suede fabrics and leather increased during and contributed to a more difficult competitive environment 
the political climate in the middle east continued to have a negative impact on sales into that region during net yarn sales increased  to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the effort made by the company to penetrate the craft yarn sector 
the gross volume of fabric sold decreased  to million yards in from million yards in the weighted average gross sales price per yard increased  to in from in as a result of product mix changes 
the company sold fewer yards of middle to better end fabrics and fewer yards of promotional end fabrics in than in the average gross sales price per yard of middle to better end fabrics increased by  to in from in the average gross sales price per yard of promotional end fabrics decreased by  to in from in gross margin 
the gross margin percentage for decreased to as compared to for total fixed costs increased by approximately million due primarily to higher payroll taxes and fringe benefits in compared to the gross profit margin also was negatively affected by higher raw material costs in versus  primarily due to increased petrochemical costs and higher variable labor and overhead costs caused by inefficiencies in the company s manufacturing operations as demand and production rates declined 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in and  respectively 
lower variable costs in  such as sales commissions  resulting from lower sales were offset by higher sampling expenses and million of costs incurred in connection with the company s sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses were higher as a percentage of net sales due to lower sales 
interest expense  net 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in lower average levels of senior debt was the primary reason for the decrease 
effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate was a benefit of in compared to a provision of in the tax benefit rate in was increased to principally due to the million favorable settlement of certain claims for federal research and development tax credits 
the company is currently challenging tax assessments from the massachusetts department of revenue mdor for the years during the third quarter of  the company filed amended tax returns with the mdor claiming approximately million of research and development tax credits for the years also  additional credits of million were claimed on the originally filed tax returns for and the mdor is currently reviewing the amended tax returns 
there is significant uncertainty surrounding the amount  if any  and timing of the benefit that will be ultimately realized 
the company believes that it has a supportable basis for claiming these research and development tax credits  but the amounts are subject to an ongoing audit 
accordingly  the company has not reflected the potential benefits of these credits in its financial statements for these or subsequent years 
no benefit will be recognized in the financial statements until these gain contingencies are resolved through the eventual disposition with the tax authorities 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for decreased million  or  to million from million in net fabric sales decreased due to decreases in both domestic and foreign fabric sales 
net fabric sales within the united states decreased  to million in from million in  as a result of increased competition from leather and poor macroeconomic conditions for much of the year  particularly in the furniture sector 
net foreign sales decreased  to million in from million in this decrease in foreign sales was due primarily to lower sales in mexico  canada and the middle east 
in mexico  where the company competes primarily with mexican fabric mills  weakness in the mexican peso versus the us dollar caused the company to be at a competitive disadvantage vis a vis mexican domestic mills for much of a significant portion of furniture manufactured in canada is actually sold in the united states 
as a result of a strong canadian dollar during  canadian furniture sales into the united states declined  reducing demand for the company s upholstery fabric in canada 
the political climate in the middle east during negatively impacted sales into that region 
net yarn sales decreased  to million in from million in the gross volume of fabric sold decreased  to million yards in from million yards in the weighted average gross sales price per yard increased  to in from in as a result of product mix changes 
the company sold fewer yards of middle to better end fabrics and fewer yards of promotional end fabrics in than in the average gross sales price per yard of middle to better end fabrics increased by  to in from in the average gross sales price per yard of promotional end fabrics increased by  to in from in gross margin 
the gross margin percentage for decreased to as compared to for gross profit declined by million due to lower production volumes resulting in higher fixed costs per unit 
also  total fixed costs increased by approximately million in as compared to primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense 
these higher unit costs were partially offset by improvements in manufacturing operating performance and raw material cost reductions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to lower variable costs  such as sales commissions  resulting from lower sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses were higher as a percentage of net sales due to lower sales 
interest expense  net 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in lower average levels of senior debt  and lower rates of interest were the primary reasons for the decrease 
effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate was for and for the company provides for income taxes on an interim basis  using an estimated annual effective income tax rate 
the company s estimated tax rate was for and the first quarter of in the second quarter of  the company adjusted the estimated annual effective tax rate for downward to 
this reduction in the tax rate is due to lower levels of projected income for reducing the effective statutory federal tax rate from to approximately and an increased estimated benefit to the tax rate from the extraterritorial income exclusion 
in the fourth quarter of  the company adjusted the annual effective tax rate to 
this increase was due to the tariff refund received from the mexican tax authorities during the fourth quarter which was taxed at a higher rate 
the effective income tax rate is lower than the combined federal and state statutory rates  due primarily to certain tax benefits related to extraterritorial income at the federal level and investment tax credits at the state level 
liquidity and capital resources the company historically has financed its operations and capital requirements through a combination of internally generated funds  borrowings under the credit agreement as hereinafter defined  and debt and equity offerings 
the company s capital requirements have arisen principally in connection with i the purchase of equipment to expand production capacity  introduce new technologies to broaden and differentiate the company s products  and improve the company s quality and productivity performance ii increases in the company s working capital needs related to its sales growth  and iii investments in the company s information technology systems 
the primary source of the company s liquidity and capital resources in recent years has been operating cash flow 
the company s net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities decreased during due principally to a reduction in net income of million and a reduction in the deferred tax provision 
historically  the company has supplemented its operating cash flow with borrowings under the credit agreement 
capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures during were funded by operating cash flow 
management anticipates that capital expenditures for new projects will total approximately million in consisting principally of facilities maintenance expenditures  modifications needed at the  square feet manufacturing and warehousing facility leased by the company in december and a modest amount of new equipment needed to support the expansion of the company s craft yarn sales 
management believes that cash on hand  operating income and borrowings under the credit agreement as hereinafter defined  will provide sufficient funding for the company s capital expenditures  working capital and debt service needs for the foreseeable future  subject to the favorable resolution of discussions with its lenders as hereinafter defined described below

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk approximately of the company s revenues are generated outside the us from sales which are not denominated in us dollars 
foreign currency risk arises because the company engages in business in mexico and brazil in local currency 
accordingly  in the absence of hedging activities  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on the company s results of operations  and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the other major currencies  there is a positive affect on the company s results of operations 
it is the company s policy to minimize  for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on its results of operations of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the fair value of foreign currency denominated intercompany payables 
the company s primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the us dollar are the mexican peso and the brazilian real 
at january   the company had the following significant derivative financial instruments to hedge the anticipated cash flows from the repayment of foreign currency denominated intercompany payables outstanding notional weighted amount in average notional local contract amount in fair type of instrument currency currency rate us dollars value maturity forward contract mexican peso million million  dec 
forward contract brazilian real million million  july the company estimated the change in the fair value of all derivative financial instruments assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the change in fair value of all derivative financial instruments would result in approximately million unrealized loss  whereas a weakening of the us dollar would result in approximately a million unrealized gain 
interest rate risk all of the company s long term debt is at fixed rates  and has been classified as current in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  classification of obligations when a violation is waived by the creditor  due to the debt covenant violations existing at january  accordingly  a change in interest rates has an insignificant effect on the company s interest expense 
the fair value of the company s long term debt  however  would change in response to interest rate movements due to its fixed rate nature 
using a scenario analysis  the company has evaluated the impact on all long term maturities of changing the interest rate from the rate levels that existed at january  and has determined that such a rate change would not have a material impact on the company
