item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition as of december  and results of operations for the years ended december    and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are engaged in the provision of dna testing services that generate genetic profile information by analyzing an organism s unique genetic identity 
we incorporated as a delaware corporation and began operations in in the first three years of business we were primarily focused on developing our microfluidics technologies for applications in high throughput production of small molecules under collaborative research programs with smithkline beecham and sarnoff corporation 
in  we made a fundamental shift away from the development of microfluidics technologies and focused our business on the application of our technology to determine genetic variability and differences  including genotyping snps 
at that time  we acquired molecular tool  followed by the acquisition of genescreen  a provider of identity testing services  in december during this period we expanded our offering dna testing services and developed instruments and kits that could be used for genotyping snp s performed independently by third parties 
in  we acquired two other identity genomics businesses cellmark and lifecodes 
from through  our business focused on snp scoring products and services that used our proprietary primer extension technology  and on our identity genomics services in paternity and forensics 
in december  we disposed of our snp genotyping instrumentation and related consumables assets offered by our orchid life sciences business unit 
beginning late in  based on a decision to pursue the sale of our diagnostics business unit  we reflected this business as a discontinued operation in our consolidated results of operations 
we completed the divestiture of our diagnostics business unit in january in  we focused our business on dna testing for human identity as well as for animal and agricultural applications 
in the human identity area  we provide dna testing services for forensic  family relationship and security applications 
forensic dna testing is primarily used to establish or maintain databases of individuals convicted of crimes or  in some instances  arrested in connection with crimes  confirm that a suspect committed a particular crime or to exonerate an innocent person 
family relationship dna testing is used to establish whether two or more people are genetically related 
recently  dna testing has been used by individuals and employers in security applications by seeking to establish a person s genetic identity and store it for identification purposes in the event of an emergency or accident 
in the animal and agriculture field  we provide dna testing services for food safety and selective trait breeding 
our services are used extensively in each of these applications  and we expect their uses to increase as these markets continue to grow and new commercial applications evolve 
we have operations in the us and in the uk 
we market our services in many countries and the majority of our current customers are based in north america and europe 
we conduct forensic dna testing primarily for government agencies 
we provide our family dna testing services to both government agencies and private 
table of contents individuals 
we market our security dna testing services to government agencies  commercial companies and private individuals 
we perform animal and agriculture dna testing services for government agencies and commercial companies 
our revenues are predominately generated from services provided to our customers that relate to the completion of dna testing 
our costs and expenses consist of costs of service revenue  research and development expense  marketing and sales expense  general and administrative expenses and other income and expense 
costs of service revenues consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees paid for the collection of samples  and facility expenses 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for development  laboratory supplies  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
marketing and sales expense consists of salaries and benefits for salespeople within our company and all related costs of selling and marketing our products and services 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
other income and expense  net consists principally of interest income and interest expense  respectively 
our operating results improved for as compared to overall  for the year ended december   as compared to  we increased total revenues  improved service revenue gross margin to as compared to service revenue gross margin of in the comparable period in in addition  for the first time in our history we reported income from continuing operations before income taxes for two consecutive quarters in the amount of approximately million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of loss from continuing operations before income taxes improved from million in to million for the year ended december  our service revenue gross margin for the full year in was slightly below our projected levels as a result of start up costs for our newly implemented enhanced automation capabilities in our codis testing business 
we experienced higher than anticipated testing volumes for codis testing in the latter part of our codis testing services have slightly lower average gross margins than some of our other lines of business 
our revenues for forensic testing services in the us are dependent in part on the amount and timing of federal funding for forensic dna testing through the nij 
in  we continued to see an increase in the amount of funding made available by the nij to various governmental and law enforcement establishments around the us 
partly as a result of increased funding  we successfully entered into or renewed several nij funded state contracts in in addition  we expect that the recent congressional enactment of the president s dna initiative  the justice for all act of  should provide increased funding over the next several years to private forensic laboratories  in order to process dna backlogs in criminal investigations 
the legislation authorizes an infusion of more than billion in federal funds over the next five years to eliminate the current backlog of unanalyzed dna evidence languishing in police department evidence rooms  to afford greater access to dna testing by convicted offenders and to enable expansion of the codis database 
our operations in the uk provided all of our animal and agricultural testing services  in addition to a portion of our paternity and forensic dna testing services  and accounted for and of our total revenues for and  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december  and  and  respectively  of our uk revenues were derived through agreements with two contractors  defra and fal 
in june of  the defra contract was renewed for two more years 
the contract with fal was executed in july of with an initial term of five years  and the term will continue for additional one year periods thereafter unless either party gives not less than twelve months written notice of termination prior to the end of the then current term 
we continued to see strong volumes in our scrapie susceptibility testing businesses in  however we did experience the expected seasonality in our scrapie testing  where we typically see our scrapie testing volumes decline in the late fall and winter months  which masks the sequential quarterly growth of many of our other services 
we would expect to see the continued impact of the seasonality in our scrapie business in the beginning of  until the spring and summer months 
we continue to expect our uk business to be a 
table of contents significant part of our business 
we expect to experience continued growth in our uk business in the animal and agriculture testing through expected increases in the amount of testing we perform for defra and other customers for scrapie susceptibility in sheep 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  our revenues were favorably impacted by five basis points as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british lb as compared to the us dollar 
excluding the favorable impact of the exchange rate movement  the growth rate in revenues for year ended december  was 
the significant percentage of our revenue derived from our uk operations makes us vulnerable to future fluctuations in the exchange rate  and there can be no assurance that the recent favorable trend in this exchange rate will not be reversed  which would have an unfavorable translation impact on our consolidated financial results 
our operating results are driven by our ability to generate sales and improve operating efficiency 
partially as a result of the implementation of our restructuring plan throughout and  we reported operating income during the third and fourth quarters of of million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to report improvements in operating results and operating cash flow in our long term strategic plan is dependent on improving operating efficiencies during we expect that these operating efficiency improvements  together with our expected annual growth in revenue during of to  will result in improved gross margins during if we achieve our targeted revenue growth  we would generate approximately to million in total revenues for the year ended december   fueled by the expected growth in our forensic  private paternity  animal and agriculture testing 
we expect to realize a gross margin of approximately for the year ended december  as a result of higher sales volume and continued increases in operating efficiencies in our testing processes 
in addition  we continually seek ways to further increase the efficiency of our operations 
we continue to believe that our current level of overhead expenses is sufficient to support our planned revenue growth in  and we anticipate that these expenses will be slightly higher than levels  primarily due to an anticipated expansion of our efforts in the sales and marketing areas 
our outlook for is based in part on our renewed two year contract with the uk government as their major provider of scrapie genotyping services  our expectation that we will be awarded a significant portion of nij funded state contracts  and that our expanded sales and marketing efforts will be successful 
during the fourth quarter of  we reported net income allocable to common stockholders of million 
however  prior to the fourth quarter  we had never reported net income  and we had incurred losses since inception 
as of december  we had stockholders equity of approximately million  which included an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we had previously indicated that we expected to attain profitability in the second half of  however  due to market circumstances  particularly the rate at which funding of forensic testing was released from the nij  we were unable to achieve our objective 
we currently do expect to achieve positive operating income for the full year of during the first quarter of  we closed a common stock private equity financing in the amount of million  net of closing costs 
in addition  as of february   of our redeemable convertible preferred stockholders had converted their shares of series a preferred stock to common stock 
in connection with the common stock private equity financing  on march   we filed a registration statement with the sec covering the resale of the shares of common stock sold  as well as the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants issued in the financing  which was declared effective on may  as a result of these measures  we expect to have adequate capital to fund operations at least through march  on january   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec  to provide us with further opportunities to raise capital 
this shelf registration will permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to million of our common stock 
we do not anticipate the need to raise additional capital in to fund current operations  however  if we determine that this need exists  or if we intend to fund future growth opportunities  we may use this shelf registration to provide financing 
this registration statement was declared effective on may

revenues from our service businesses of paternity  forensic and animal and agricultural testing for the twelve months ended december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
the increase in revenues from our service businesses was primarily attributable to an increase in testing volumes experienced during the year ended december  revenues from our uk based service business grew to approximately million during the twelve months ended december  as compared to approximately million during the comparable period of the prior year 
we continued to see an increase in the amount of funding made available by the nij to various governmental and law enforcement establishments throughout the us  which contributed to us entering into or renewing several nij funded state contracts in we expect to experience increased testing volumes for the foreseeable future  despite an anticipated sequential slight decline in testing volumes for the first quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of this slight decline represents the impact of the inherent seasonality in our animal testing business during the winter months 

table of contents as a result of the acquisition of cellmark  in february  the acquisition of lifecodes in december  and a limited number of agreements with foreign companies  our business has become increasingly global  with international revenue representing and of total revenue during the year ended december  and  respectively 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during and had a favorable impact of five basis points on our consolidated revenues 
we are prepared to hedge against any fluctuations in foreign currencies should such fluctuations be deemed to have a material economic impact on the company  although we have not engaged in hedging activities to date 
in august of  we entered into a three year agreement with defra to provide genotypes on sheep in order to test the animals for their susceptibility or resistance to scrapie 
in  this contract was renewed for two more years 
we also signed an agreement in july of with fal  an agency through which we perform forensic testing services for multiple police forces throughout the uk 
the agreement with fal has an initial term of five years  and the term will continue for additional one year periods thereafter unless either party gives not less than twelve months written notice of termination prior to the end of the then current term 
it is by virtue of our relationship with fal that we have been able to increase our revenues based on this forensic testing 
revenue for the year ended december  and under these two agreements was approximately and of our total revenues for each period respectively 
during the twelve months ended december   we recognized approximately million in other revenues  specifically license and grant revenues  as compared to approximately million during the comparable period of the prior year

cost of service revenues cost of service revenues was approximately million  or of service revenues  for the twelve months ended december  compared to approximately million  or of service revenues for the comparable period of the prior year 
the increase in cost of service revenues primarily reflects growth in revenues from our businesses of forensic  paternity and animal and agricultural testing services 
the decline of cost of services as a percentage of revenue in as compared to was primarily related to staffing increases made in the latter part of  in both our uk operations and our us based forensic operations in preparation for the addition of new contracts attained late in and in the first quarter of these additional hires provided us with sufficient resources for the defra agreement  the fal agreement and our other recently secured contracts 
in addition  we continued to see operational efficiencies due to increased testing volumes in our service businesses 
we expect a continued decrease in costs of services as a percentage of service revenues as testing volumes increase 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the comparable period of the prior year 
the significant decrease in research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the previous year was primarily attributable to a reduction in the research and development efforts undertaken by our geneshield business unit

table of contents during the year ended december   we recognized an additional million in restructuring charges related to one of our former operating facilities in princeton  new jersey 
the additional charge was a result of a change in our estimate as to when we expect to sublease this facility and the estimated discount associated with such a sublease arrangement 
during the twelve months ended december   we settled two restructuring obligations on favorable terms 
the first favorable settlement related to our leasehold obligation for one of our princeton based facilities

net loss and net loss allocable to common stockholders due to the factors described above  which includes restructuring charges and impairment of asset charges  during the twelve months ended december   we reported a net loss of approximately million compared to a net loss of approximately million for the comparable period of the prior year 
we also recorded a beneficial conversion feature  dividends and accretion of approximately million  which was included in our net loss allocable to common stockholders of approximately million 
the beneficial conversion feature of million related to our march financing and was calculated as the difference between the per share value as of the commitment date and the per share value of the transaction after giving effect to the value associated with the warrants to purchase common stock issued in the financing 
the approximately million in dividends relate to the dividend payable to the holders of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in addition  we accreted approximately million for the conversion of shares of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock during the twelve months ended december  see liquidity and capital resources below for a further discussion of the financing 
reverse stock split on march   the company s board of directors approved a reverse stock split of for all amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and elsewhere herein have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split on a retroactive basis 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to approximately million as of december  in addition  as of december   we had approximately million of short term investments  which consisted of certificates of deposit  auction rate securities and commercial paper purchased during the third quarter of working capital increased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  this increase in working capital was primarily a result of net proceeds from our common stock private equity financing in the amount of million  net of closing costs  which closed on february  sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity have been capital raising activities  including issuances of our securities and borrowings under our credit facility 
the line of credit facility we had obtained from a commercial bank in december was terminated in december our operations used million in cash for the year ended and million for the year ended december  our working capital increased from million as of december  to million as of december  our operations provided approximately million in cash during the third quarter of and approximately million in cash during the second quarter of  as compared to cash used in operations of approximately during the first quarter of and approximately million during the fourth quarter of our loss from continuing operations of approximately million included 
table of contents approximately million recorded as an additional reserve for one of our former operating facilities in princeton  new jersey  and approximately million in general and administration expenses related to our various financing transactions  which were incurred in the first quarter of we expect that revenues will increase in by approximately to compared to  and that we will achieve positive operating income for the full year of we expect this improvement in cash flow and profitability will result from the improved sales volume projected for  as well as continued improvement in gross margins as a result of our continued focus on improving operational efficiency and capacity utilization 
the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the components of our liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and in thousands change change cash and cash equivalents cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash used in operations for the twelve months ended december  was approximately million compared with net cash used in operations of approximately million for the prior year 
this improvement of net cash used in operations resulted primarily from the improved efficiencies in the business  including increased testing volumes and the disposal of our discontinued operations in january of net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for investing activities during included the purchase of approximately million of short term investments and million of capital expenditures primarily related to our uk operations 
financing activities during the year ended december  were approximately million  which included approximately million of net proceeds from our common stock private equity financing  which closed on february   and approximately million received as a result of the exercise of warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
these increases were in part offset by payments on debt and patent obligations 
february private placement on february   we entered into definitive agreements with new and existing accredited institutional investors to raise approximately million in gross proceeds in a common stock private equity financing 
pursuant to the agreements  we sold approximately million shares of common stock at per share and granted the investors four year warrants to purchase approximately an additional million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
the transaction closed on february  we filed a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock sold in the financing  as well as the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants granted in the financing  which was declared effective by the sec on may  shelf registration statement separate from and prior to the common stock private equity financing of february   we filed a registration statement on form s which the sec declared effective on may  this shelf registration statement permits us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to million of our common stock 
march private placement on march   we completed a private placement of  units  each consisting of one share of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock  which resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
we registered the shares underlying the series a redeemable 
table of contents convertible preferred stock and the warrants on a registration statement on form s filed with the sec on may  as of february   all shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted into common stock and no shares of series a convertible preferred stock remain issued or outstanding 
equipment financing at december   we had borrowings of approximately million outstanding related to a loan which was entered into primarily for equipment financing 
under the loan agreement we must maintain minimum unrestricted cash  as defined in the loan agreement  equal to the greater of million or twelve months cash needs calculated by taking the trailing three months net cash used in operations multiplied by four  we are required to provide a cash security deposit or letter of credit equal to an amount defined in the loan agreement  not to exceed of outstanding amounts on draws made in or subsequent to december as of december   and just prior to our march equity offering  we did not maintain the minimum unrestricted cash defined in the loan agreement 
we received a waiver from our lender regarding our noncompliance with this covenant for this period 
subsequent to march   we did not maintain the minimum cash defined in the loan agreement 
we also received written notice from the lender stating that the lender waived the financial covenant violation as a result of not maintaining a pledge of cash security deposit or letter or credit under this loan agreement for the period of noncompliance through june  on june   we obtained a letter of credit in the amount of approximately million as required by the loan agreement  which was supported by a cash restriction on certain securities held by us 
during  our required letter of credit or cash deposit became less than the original million letter of credit established because we continued to pay down our monthly obligation in accordance with the original terms of the loan line 
the restricted cash amount related to this equipment line was approximately million 
this cash restriction  in addition to the cash restricted under two of our operating leases  is reflected as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  of million  of which approximately million is classified as a long term asset 
expected uses of liquidity in throughout  we plan to continue making substantial investments in our business 
in that regard  we expect the following to be significant uses of liquidity cost of service revenues  salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees for the collection of samples and facility expenses as well as general and administrative costs which consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  general legal and intellectual property and other corporate expenses 
we expect to incur capital expenditures in of between million and million  although we may incur additional capital expenditures if opportunities arise to grow our business more aggressively 
in addition  we may make investments in future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies which would increase our capital expenditures 
the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including our development activities  our investments in technology  the amount of cash generated by our operations and the amount and extent of our acquisitions  if any 
actual expenditures may vary substantially from our estimates 

table of contents we maintain multiple contractual commitments as of december   which will support our future business operations 
such commitments relate to noncancelable operating lease arrangements  long term debt  minimum supply purchases and future patent and minimum royalty obligations 
we have identified and quantified the most significant of these commitments in the following table 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations long term debt obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected total contractual obligations such amounts represent future minimum rental commitments for office space leased under noncancelable operating lease arrangements 
we lease approximately  square feet for operations in the us and approximately  square feet in the uk to support foreign operations 
such amounts primarily consist of amounts payable pursuant to our equipment loan line 
also included in such amounts are capital lease obligations for certain machinery and equipment including interest 
such amounts represent obligations to pay future amounts over the next three years in conjunction with our acquisition of us patent no 
 and its foreign counterparts from affymetrix in july as well as our obligation to pay st 
louis university in connection with our patent acquisition 
such amounts represent an unconditional guarantee related to the lease for the stamford  connecticut based laboratory  which was assigned in connection with the sale of the diagnostics business unit to tepnel 
we were required to sign this guarantee as a condition of the sale 
we reflected the fair value of the guarantee of approximately million as a reduction to the net realizable value of these assets and liabilities 
we valued the guarantee based on the existing terms and conditions of the lease  an estimated vacancy of the space for one year prior to subleasing the space  and discounted the expected rents for a potential sublease of the space 
the lease terminates in april of minimum rents under the assigned lease total approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash on hand  which includes the additional funds raised through the common stock private equity offering in february  will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through march  we expect to achieve positive operating income for the full year of we do not anticipate the need to raise additional capital in however  we may need to access the capital markets for additional financing to fund future growth opportunities or to operate our ongoing business activities after a period of time if our future results of operations fall below our expectations 
if so  we may not be able to raise additional funds or raise funds on terms that are acceptable to us 
if future financing is not available to us  or is not available on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to fund our future needs 
if we raise funds through equity or convertible securities  our stockholders may experience dilution and our stock price may decline 
we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that we will not require substantial additional funding before we can achieve profitable operations 
we also may need additional capital if we seek to acquire other businesses or technologies 
as of december   our net operating loss carry forwards were approximately million and approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  our federal and state tax loss carry forwards will begin to expire in and  respectively 
utilization of our net operating losses to offset future taxable income  if any  may be substantially limited due to change of 
table of contents ownership provisions in the internal revenue code of we have not yet determined the extent to which limitations were triggered as a result of past financings or may be triggered as a result of future financings 
this annual limitation is likely to result in the expiration of certain net operating losses prior to their use 
compensation charges in prior years  we recorded deferred compensation resulting from the granting of stock options to employees  directors  or consultants with exercise prices below the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of their grant 
during  and  all stock options were granted with grant prices equal to the fair value of our common stock at the grant date 
the portion of these deferred compensation amounts which resulted from grants to consultants is subject to remeasurement at the end of each reporting period based upon the changes in the fair value of our common stock until the consultant completes performance under his or her respective option agreement 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill income taxes stock based compensation revenue recognition we recognize dna laboratory services revenues at the time test results are completed and reported 
deferred revenues represent the unearned portion of payments received in advance of tests being completed and reported 
unbilled receivables represent revenue  which has been earned on completed and reported tests  but has not been billed to the customer 
revenues from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations of the licensee  are recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have no significant continuing involvement under the terms of the arrangement 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the performance period  which are subject to change 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the amount of revenues from licenses reported in any given period 
revenues from research and development agreements are recognized when related research expenses are incurred and when we have satisfied specific obligations under the terms of the respective agreements 
prior to  we had several sources of revenues  including research and development collaborations  snp scoring services  snp stream system hardware sales  consumable sales  and license arrangements 
we have discontinued operations related to these products 
prior to our acquisitions of genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes  we derived substantially all of our revenues from research and development collaborations  technology grants and awards from several governmental agencies 
in  we derived our first revenues from the placement of our first commercial hardware system  and through  we derived revenues from the sale of consumables used by the hardware system 
as a result of the sale of certain assets to beckman coulter in december of  we no longer have revenues from placements of these products and consumables 
we also derived license revenues beginning in in  we derived our first revenues from the performance of laboratory testing services by genescreen  our wholly owned subsidiary  in the us 
in  we derived our first revenues from the sale of testing kits and laboratory testing services from our cellmark division in the uk 

table of contents in connection with the research and development collaborations that provided the majority of our revenues in the early years of our corporate history  we recognized revenues when related research expenses are incurred and when we satisfied specific performance obligations under the terms of the respective research contracts 
we deferred up front licensing fees obtained in connection with such agreements and amortized them over the estimated performance period of the respective research contract 
we recognized milestone payments as revenues when the milestone event or requirement was completed  if it represented the achievement of a significant step in research and development or performance process 
we offered some of our hardware products in two basic types of transactions  either a purchase and sale transaction or an arrangement in which the customer takes possession of the product and pays an access fee for its use 
we recorded revenues on the sale of the hardware upon transfer of title and after we had met all of our significant performance obligations 
we deferred access fee payments that we received when a system was initially placed with a customer and recognized revenues on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
we have divested this portion of our business and no longer sell instruments or consumables 
revenues from the sale of consumables were recognized upon the transfer of title  generally when our products were shipped to our customers from our facilities 
we have divested this portion of our business and no longer sell instruments or consumables 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of amortizable identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decrease in market value of assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of amortizable intangibles and other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
net amortizable intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of december  goodwill is subject to at least an annual recoverability assessment pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes 
we have generated net operating losses for tax purposes since inception 
as of december   these losses generated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
in addition  due to our restructuring efforts certain charges written off in the current and prior years were not deductible for income tax purposes 
these differences result in gross deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that the gross deferred tax assets  net of any deferred tax liabilities will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining this valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which the net deferred tax assets will be recoverable 

table of contents conversely  if we are profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  for which a valuation has been recorded  we would record the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset at that time and would then pay income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rate of approximately 
stock option compensation we account for options granted to employees and directors in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense is recorded on fixed stock option grants only if the current fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option at the date of grant and it is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period

risk factors forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements 
such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those described in such forward looking statements 
these statements address or may address the following subjects our expectation that the use of our dna testing services will grow as new applications evolve in family relationship  forensic  security and animal and agricultural markets  our belief that we have the capability to compete as a testing services provider in the personalized medicine business  our expectation that  with the increasing availability of genomic data derived from species other than human  improved characteristics in livestock or crops will be produced to protect humans against animal borne diseases  our belief that adoption of statement r will result in material charges to the company s statement of operations  our belief that our experience as a reliable provider of services to government agencies is a valued credential that can be used in securing both new contracts and renewing existing contracts

table of contents for further information  refer to the more specific factors and uncertainties discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the risk factors section hereof 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
you should also carefully consider the factors set forth in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
if any of the matters included in the following risks were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the value of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business if we fail to maintain the service contracts we have with various state and governmental agencies or fail to enter into additional contracts  we would lose a significant source of revenues 
we currently derive approximately of our revenues from the paternity  forensic and animal and agricultural testing fields 
these services are heavily dependent upon contracts we have with various governmental agencies  which are typically open to bid and usually have a term from one to three years 
the process and criteria for these awards are typically complex and highly competitive  particularly with respect to price of services offered 
we may not be able to maintain any of our existing governmental contracts or be the successful bidder on any additional governmental contracts  which may become available in the future  or negotiate terms acceptable to us in connection with any governmental contract awarded to us  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently receive more than of our annual gross revenue through relationships with two customers 
in august of  we entered into a three year agreement with defra to provide genotyping on sheep in order to test the animals for their susceptibility or resistance to scrapie  which agreement was renewed in june of for two years 
these services were provided under an initiative called the national scrapie plan to provide genotyping services in the hopes of aiding british farmers to breed sheep with reduced susceptibility to scrapie 
under the agreement  we received income during that was approximately of our total annual revenues 
we also signed a five year agreement in july of with fal  an agency through which we perform forensic testing services for multiple police forces throughout the uk 
it is by virtue of our relationship with fal that we have been able to increase our revenues based on forensic testing such that the income we received was approximately of our gross revenues for the fiscal year ended december  if this agreement is not renewed  it could have a material impact on the financial condition of our business 
together  these two agreements constituted of international revenues for the fiscal year ended december   and of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended december we cannot guarantee the receipt of revenue from our government contracts 
we regularly compete in an open bid forum in order to secure or renew contracts with various law enforcement and governmental agencies for the provision of dna based testing services 
while many times a contract award may have limits that may be paid out under the contract as allowed by state or other approved funding  we are not always able to rely on a fixed amount of revenue based on services provided under the contract 
for example  there may be a regulatory or other administrative basis beyond our control for which we do not receive the anticipated number of samples to be tested under a contract  which may have an adverse outcome on services billed or revenue received during a given fiscal period 
also  many contracts with governmental agencies allow for the agency to terminate a contract at any time if funding is not available to pay for our services 

table of contents our failure to comply with applicable government and industry regulations or to maintain accreditations may affect our ability to develop  produce or market our potential products and services and may adversely affect our results of operations 
all of our laboratories maintain industry accreditations as they pertain to the provision of both paternity and forensic testing both in the us and the uk  and voluntary accreditation by the new york state department of health 
in addition  our uk laboratory must maintain iso accreditation in order to continue to provide forensic testing services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our accreditations with any of these agencies as applicable to the provision of testing services 
if we lose our accreditation by any of these agencies  this could adversely affect our existing contracts which  in many cases  require that we maintain accreditation  and could adversely affect our ability to enter into new contracts 
as a result  our revenues could be eliminated or significantly reduced 
our development and testing activities also involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products  as well as the conveyance  processing  and storage of biological specimens 
if we were in violation of any laws or regulations pertaining to the handling or use of hazardous materials  the remediation costs could be high and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 
international sales are subject to increased costs and other risks  which could affect our revenues 
our business includes international sales which are subject to certain inherent risks  including difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  potentially longer payment cycles  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  currency fluctuations as they impact reported results  changes in regulatory requirements  and difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights 
during  we derived of our revenues from international sales 
in december of  we instituted a lawsuit against a customer of our then diagnostics business unit  dkms which operates out of dresden  germany 
dkms had accumulated a significant past due receivable account for diagnostic services that we provided to them 
however  the parties reached a settlement of this dispute  and the matter was dismissed from the court in september other than the foregoing  no risks associated with international sales have adversely affected our business 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  if we fail to reach profitability and need to acquire additional capital to fund our current and future operating plans or obtain it on unfavorable terms  then we may have to take further cost cutting measures to our operations 
we have expended significant resources developing our facilities and funding commercialization activities 
as a result  we have incurred significant losses to date 
we had net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through march  our ability to reduce operating losses in was due in part  to our ability to divest non core businesses which were not profitable  including our life sciences and diagnostics business units 
if we fail to reach cash flow self sufficiency  we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity linked securities or we may have to further review our existing operations to determine new measures of cost reduction  such as further consolidation of operational facilities and or reductions in staff 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results may negatively impact our stock price 
revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and fluctuations are likely to continue in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include the timing of federal funding for forensic dna testing of backlog reductions through the nij  our ability to secure new contractual relationships for paternity forensic and animal and agricultural testing or retain existing relationships upon contract expirations  
table of contents the volume and timing of testing samples received in our laboratories for testing services  the number  timing and significance of new services introduced by our competitors  our ability to develop  market and introduce new services on a timely basis  changes in the cost  quality and availability of intellectual property and components required to perform our services  availability of commercial and government funding to researchers who use our services  and the inherent seasonality in our animal testing business during the winter months 
fixed operating costs associated with our technologies and services  as well as personnel costs  marketing programs and overhead account for a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
we cannot adjust these expenses quickly in the short term 
if our testing volumes and related pricing decline due to market pressure  our revenues will decline and we may not able to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
our loss of revenues and failure to reduce operating expenses could harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
in addition  market and other conditions may require certain non cash charges such as stock based compensation charges and other charges such as impairment charges related to long lived assets and restructuring charges to be recorded by us in future periods 
if our operating results in some quarters fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock is likely to fall 
future acquisitions or mergers could disrupt our ongoing operations  increase our expenses and adversely affect our revenues 
although we have no commitments or agreements with respect to any additional acquisitions or mergers at present  we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may be accomplished either by acquiring or merger with existing businesses 
factors that will affect the success of any potential acquisition or merger to be made by us include our ability to integrate acquired personnel  operations  products and technologies into our organization effectively  to motivate personnel and to retain customers of acquired or merged businesses 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or merger opportunities  obtain necessary financing for an acquisition on acceptable terms or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations 
while we have not experienced material disruption to our ongoing business  distraction to our management and employees as a result of past acquisitions  we may experience such disruptions or distractions in the future 
our improvement of existing technologies and our ability to capture and develop future technologies to be utilized in our service offerings may not be commercially successful  which could adversely affect our revenues 
we are currently developing and commercializing a limited number of products and services based on our technologies in dna testing of humans and animals 
these services involve uses of products  software and technologies that require validation for commercial application  and we cannot assure you that we or our customers will be able to recognize a cost effective  commercial benefit in using our technology 
in addition  any assays we develop utilizing snp analysis technology may not be useful in assisting in food safety testing 
only a limited number of companies have developed or commercialized products based on utilizing snp technology to date 
accordingly  even if we or our customers are successful in developing effective assays utilizing snp technology  we cannot assure you that these discoveries will lead to commercially successful service offerings 
if we fail to successfully develop our snp scoring technologies or any products and services based on such technologies  we may not achieve a competitive position in the market 
our growth and future operating results will depend  in part  upon our ability to apply new technologies to automate and improve our dna testing services to take advantage of new technologies 
there can be no assurance that our development efforts will result in any additional commercially viable or successful improvements or efficiencies to our testing processes 
any potential improvements to the testing process may 
table of contents require substantial additional investment and possibly regulatory approvals  prior to implementation 
our inability to successfully develop improvements to our testing processes  increase efficiencies  or to achieve market acceptance of such improvements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future sales and marketing efforts may not be successful in achieving our expected revenue growth 
we plan to continue to market our products and services to governments  corporations and private individuals 
our ability to successfully obtain new business  and where appropriate  enter into and maintain agreements with our customers  depends in part  on the quality and pricing of our products and services 
if we are unable to successfully implement our marketing plans  fail to maintain or enhance the quality of our products and services  or offer attractive pricing for our products and services  this could have a material adverse effect on our expected revenue growth and financial condition 
we have adequate sales and marketing resources  but if our resources become limited  we may not achieve our expected revenue growth 
we have adequate resources in sales and marketing  but are subject to the possibility that our competitors may recruit our employees 
as of december   we had only employees dedicated to marketing and sales  none of whom have employment contracts with us 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies for any of these individuals 
our sales and marketing resources are used to market our services to governments  corporations and individuals 
if we do not have adequate sales and marketing resources  this could have a material adverse effect on our expected revenue growth and financial condition 
we may be held liable for any inaccuracies associated with our services  which may require us to defend ourselves in costly litigation 
we provide forensic  paternity  and animal and agriculture testing services 
claims may be brought against us for false identification of paternity or other inaccuracies 
litigation of these claims in most cases is covered by our existing liability policies 
however  we could expend significant funds during any litigation proceeding brought against us and litigation can be a distraction to management 
if a court were to require us to pay damages to a plaintiff  if not covered by our existing insurance  the amount of such damages could significantly harm our financial condition  and even if insured  damages could exceed our insurance policy coverage limits 
we currently maintain products liability insurance with a maximum coverage limitation of million and general laboratory professional liability insurance with a coverage limitation of million 
we have been named a defendant in a number of minor suits where it has been alleged that we have either misreported results or the results of testing have been misinterpreted 
none of the outcomes of these suits have had a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to provide services may be seriously impaired by the occurrence of a natural disaster affecting any one of our laboratories 
should we experience the occurrence of a natural disaster affecting any one of our laboratories such that we would be unable to continue to provide services out of that facility for an extended period of time  and were we not able to scale up operations at one of our other facilities in order to continue to provide such services  we would be at risk of losing significant contractual revenue from governmental agencies since many of our governmental agency contracts allow for the agency to terminate the contract early if we became unable to continue to render such services for an extended period of time  usually days or more 
however  we have multiple facilities  and may be able to shift operations from one facility to another in the event of a natural disaster  thereby mitigating the effects thereof 
although we carry insurance for recovery in the instance of a natural disaster  the limits of this insurance are million  and it is possible that our coverage will not be the same in all locations or that losses in such an instance could exceed our ability to recover such costs 

table of contents if we cannot enter into new development or licensing agreements  we may be unable to further enhance our service offerings 
our strategy for developing and commercializing technologies and services based on our discoveries depends upon our ability to enter into development and licensing arrangements 
our ability to enter into advantageous licensing or development agreements will depend upon whether or not companies that have technology complimentary to ours are willing or able to enter into an agreement with us  and on our financial resources allocated to such investment 
we also may have to rely on our collaborators and licensees or licensors for marketing of services  or distribution of products and services 
if we are unable to enter into such development and licensing arrangements or implement our strategy to develop and commercialize additional products and services  it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
if we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may be forced to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products  or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable to us 
if our patent applications do not result in issued patents  our competitors may obtain rights to commercialize our discoveries  which would harm our competitive position 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patent protection on our proprietary technologies  products and services and to enforce such protection 
we may not be able to obtain new patents for these products  methods or services 
we also may not have the resources to aggressively protect and enforce existing patent protection 
we may need to obtain a license from certain third parties with respect to any patent covering technologies or methodologies which we wish to incorporate into our service offerings  but we may not be able to acquire such licenses on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be sued for infringing  or may initiate litigation to determine that we are not infringing  on the intellectual property rights of others 
intellectual property litigation is costly  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
if we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity  or obtain a license to or design around the intellectual property in question 
if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms  or are unable to practice non infringing technologies or processes  we may be unable to sell some of our products and services  which would result in reduced revenues 
we are named a defendant in a patent litigation matter 
however  we believe we have the right to practice such technology by virtue of a third party agreement  and we are actively engaged in defending this litigation 
other than the foregoing  we are not aware that we are misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others 
the scope of our issued patents may not provide us with adequate protection of our intellectual property  which would harm our competitive position 
any issued patents that cover our proprietary technologies may not provide us with substantial protection or be commercially beneficial to us 
the issuance of a patent may be challenged with respect to its validity or its enforceability 
the us patent and trademark office or a court of appropriate jurisdiction  or any one of a number foreign patent and trademark offices where we have pursued patent protection may invalidate one or more of our patents 
in addition  third parties may have patents of their own which could  if asserted  prevent us from practicing our proprietary technologies  including the methods we use to conduct genotyping 
if we are otherwise unable to practice our patented technologies  we may not be able to commercialize our technologies or services and our competitors could commercialize our technologies 
we currently believe that there may be at least one company actively infringing our proprietary single base primer extension technology 
however  we have not completed an analysis of this third party s practices or of the practices of any other third parties and cannot form a conclusion at this time as to infringement 

table of contents we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  which could result in the forfeiture of these rights 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may need to initiate patent litigation against third parties 
these lawsuits could be expensive  take significant time  and could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
these lawsuits could result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any future litigation or that a court will not find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits 
during the course of these suits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
securities analysts or investors may perceive these announcements to be negative  which would likely cause the market price of our stock to decline 
other rights and measures that we rely upon to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to protect our products and services and could reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
while we require employees  collaborators  consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and or non disclosure agreements where appropriate  any of the following could still occur the agreements may be breached  we may have inadequate remedies for any breach  proprietary information could be disclosed to our competitors  or others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technologies 
to our knowledge  we have never been materially harmed by a breach under any of circumstances listed above 
however  if for any of the above reasons our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated  it would harm both our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position 
the pursuit of a remedy for such an alleged breach may cost substantially in terms of the time  effort and expenses of the company s resources

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents and short term investments  which are conservative in nature  with a focus on preservation of capital 
due to the short term nature of our investments and the investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments are not material to our business 
we have a certain amount of long term debt recorded on our books 
the interest rates applicable to such debt are not variable with respect to market conditions 
foreign currency risk our business derives a substantial portion of its sales from international operations 
we expect that international sales may continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our financial results  although to date the impact has been favorable  though not material 
we are prepared to hedge against any fluctuations in foreign currencies should such fluctuations have a material economic impact on us  although we have not engaged in hedging activities to date
