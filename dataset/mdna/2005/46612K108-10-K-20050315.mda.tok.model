item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of sophisticated software solutions designed specifically to address the demand and supply chain management  business process  decision support  e commerce  inventory optimization  collaborative planning and forecasting and store operations requirements of the retail industry and its suppliers 
our solutions enable customers to manage and optimize their inventory flows throughout the demand chain to the consumer  and provide optimized labor scheduling for retail store operations 
our customers include over  of the world s leading retail  consumer package goods cpg manufacturers and wholesalers 
we also offer maintenance services to our software customers  and enhance and support our software business by offering implementation and other services that are designed to enable our clients to rapidly achieve the benefits of our solutions 
these services include project management  system planning  system design and implementation  custom configurations  and training services 
demand for our implementation services is driven by  and often trails  sales of our software products 
consulting services revenues are generally somewhat more predictable but generate significantly lower gross margins than software license revenues 
significant trends and developments in our business outlook for although fourth quarter of provided us with our second largest quarterly software revenue result ever  our software revenues for the full year were flat compared to our confidence in the level of activity in the market is generally better than it was a year ago  however  we do expect a sequential decline in software license revenue in first quarter due to normal seasonality 
the americas region united states  canada and latin america continues to outperform both the europe europe  middle east and africa and asia pacific regions 
the americas region provided a strong million license performance in fourth quarter but only a modest year over year software license growth in compared to results in the europe region remain weak  and we replaced our regional vice president in january of with an internal promotion 
the pipeline for new business in the europe region is better than it was a year ago  although we may still encounter internal operational issues as a result of the extensive changes made to our personnel and organizational structure in the europe region during and early the asia pacific region remains weak in terms of overall performance 
our competitive position in asia pacific remains good  and we are winning a high percentage of the opportunities we encounter  however  the overall volume of business in this region has not shown any signs of growth similar to that seen in the americas region 
we are confident that our solutions remain highly competitive  and we regularly defeat most of our competitors in head to head sales situations 
we believe that our leadership in the market is likely to continue in we do not expect total revenues to increase in unless global spending levels for information technology it significantly improve over our operating model is designed to deliver higher profitability through a reduced cost structure  even if the overall market environment does not improve 
we currently expect our overall profitability to improve substantially due to the restructuring and cost reductions we made in fourth quarter in connection with the announcement of our strategic operational plan for we expect to realize an annualized cost reduction in the range of million to million in as a result of the restructuring 
an additional restructuring charge will be required in the first half of to complete the plan  although all impacted associates were notified in the fourth quarter of an important component of our strategic operational plan for is to improve the profitability of our services organization  primarily be taking steps to increase utilization of our services personnel through headcount reductions undertaken in the fourth quarter of as a result  we currently expect overall service revenues to decline  however  service margins will gradually improve and as a result  the impact on total profits will be moderate 
as we aggressively manage this aspect of our business  we face the risk of constraints in our services offerings in the event of greater than anticipated licensing activity or more complex implementation projects 
changes in buying patterns continue to impact our operating results 
we continue to generate sales opportunities with larger companies  particularly in the americas region 
these companies typically have longer and more complex buying cycles that often involve extended due diligence processes in order to minimize the customers risk 
the retail and demand chain industry continues to exercise significant due diligence prior to making large capital outlays  and the decision making process for investments in information technology remains highly susceptible to deferral 
as a result  our sales cycles remain elongated  and we continue to experience uncertainty predicting the size and timing of individual contracts 
for example  although we signed eight large software licenses million or greater in both and  the distribution of the licenses remains uneven from quarter to quarter 
sales to new customers have historically required between three and nine months from generation of the sales lead to the execution of a software license agreement 
sales cycles are typically longer for larger dollar projects  large multi national retail organizations and retailers in certain geographic regions 
orders for certain of our products can be taken over the telephone 
we believe that delays in the decision making process have been  and may continue to be  the most significant issue affecting our software license revenue results 
delays in the customer decision making processes have resulted from a number of factors including extended due diligence procedures  corporate reorganizations  and the appointment of new senior management 
our competitive losses remain low  and we continue to experience a steady pattern of multi product deals  including in and in economic conditions have negatively impacted the demand for our merchandise operations systems and in store systems in recent years 
although we believe that significant growth in the transaction systems market will require sustained macroeconomic improvement  we have seen signs that companies are beginning to address long standing issues in their enterprise systems environments which could potentially signal a general improvement in demand for our merchandise operations systems 
our competitive environment is changing 
our industry has been going through a transition over the past few years that has resulted in fewer significant competitors in every significant product market we supply 
currently  we believe there are only two primary global competitors left for our merchandise operations systems  retek  inc and sap ag 
on february   sap ag announced a cash tender offer to purchase all of retek  inc s outstanding shares  which was followed on march  by a competing cash tender offer from oracle corporation to purchase all of retek  inc s outstanding shares 
oracle corporation does not currently compete with our retail specific products 
it is difficult to estimate what effect either of these proposed acquisitions  if finalized  would have on our competitive environment 
similarly  we believe the number of significant competitors for our in store systems has declined and that there are no significant solution providers left for strategic merchandise management solutions that have not been acquired by larger companies who have the competitive advantages of a broad product offering 
the result of these consolidations is that we will face larger competitors in the future who could have sizable resources at their disposal 
software license revenues from existing customers represented of software license revenues in compared to we believe that sales to existing customers will continue to comprise a majority of our software revenues and that this metric is a direct result of our large customer base  principally amassed through our acquisition activities in and  and the focus we have and will continue to place on back selling opportunities for jda portfolio products to existing customers through our customer value program cvp 
over the past four years  the addition of strategic merchandise management solutions such as portfolio space management by intactix and portfolio replenishment by e to the jda portfolio has provided significant back selling and growth opportunities in our customer base as approximately of our retail customer base  and substantially all of our cpg manufacturers and wholesale customers  still only own applications from one of our product families 
business opportunities and growth strategies 
we believe there are three distinct growth opportunities in the current economic environment offer value propositions in our products and pricing that make the purchase of our solutions easier and reduce the customers risk of investment 
many of our prospective customers have had poor experiences with other it vendors 
these customers are often reluctant to incur the upfront license fees we have requested in our traditional pricing model because it places much of the risk of a difficult implementation on the customer 
to address our customers concerns and overcome their caution  we have begun to offer a new proof of concept sales model for our larger transactions that allows customers to try a solution before they purchase it 
in addition  we have increased our willingness to offer a milestone based payment model on larger transactions 
we do not plan to offer these kinds of contractual terms for smaller transactions  which we believe will continue to close as they have historically 
we anticipate these new sales models will result in extended software license revenue streams that will be advantageous in the longer run  however they may reduce revenues in the near term 
we further expect to realize greater average selling prices in larger transactions under the proof of concept sales model than have been realized historically under our upfront license fee model 
we have just begun to offer our products under these new sales models so it is still too early to determine the timing and magnitude of the impact of this new approach on our operating results 
generate new business opportunities with existing and prospective customers with next generation jda portfolio products 
we believe our next generation of jda portfolio products  portfolio enabled  will create opportunities with prospective customers who seek a single  integrated solution that combines the retail disciplines of planning  assortment  purchasing  allocations and replenishment 
however  we do not currently expect to be able to estimate the rate of acceptance of these new products until late we have met our previously stated goal of beginning delivery of these solutions in early as described in product strategy 
the initial portfolio enabled solutions may not offer all the capabilities of their predecessor products but will offer the advantages of the portfolio enabled platform such as the ability to operate portfolio replenishment optimization by e on the unix oracle platform utilizing microsoft 
net componentry with subsequent releases to include microsoft sql demand for portfolio enabled solutions is difficult to estimate at this time  however  we believe there will be opportunities to sell new add on solutions to those customers that do choose to move to the portfolio enabled versions of the jda portfolio applications 
expansion of our business into areas that are complementary to our traditional retail base 
we have begun to develop and deploy broader and more sophisticated solutions to the non retail market 
our new optimize on demand solution has taken the basic space planning by intactix application and expanded it into a strategic category management offering  including additional jda applications 
in addition  we are developing new solutions around business practices such as sales and operations planning that will add to our growing complement of non retail solutions 
finally  we continue to grow our collaborative planning  forecasting and replenishment cpfr business and now have over trading partners worldwide with an estimated annual trading value of over billion who are live and fully operational on our marketplace replenishment cpfr solution 
we will continue to search for acquisition opportunities to further develop our collaborative solutions business 
long term prospects for the in store systems business segment are promising  but recent results are below expectations 
the in store systems business segment provided of our total revenues in compared to in total revenues in this business segment increased million  or in compared to primarily due to the acquisition of timera texas  inc timera on january   which provided million of this increase see we continue to grow our business through acquisitions 
excluding the incremental impact of timera  total revenues in this business segment increased only  or in compared to this business segment has been negatively impacted in recent years by what we believe is a major platform transition as market demand moves from window based point of sale applications to java based point of sale applications  as well as poor economic conditions that have caused retailers to delay major capital appropriations 
portfolio point of sale ppos  our java based in store system  was commercially released in second quarter we have only sold the ppos application to a limited number of customers since its initial release 
we do not believe the in store systems business segment will experience any significant organic growth until the ppos application becomes more mature and early adopters complete their implementations and become reference able 
industry surveys indicate that point of sales systems are becoming an increased priority for retailers  and we believe potential customers may look to partner with broad solutions providers such as jda that can bring all aspects of store operations into one integrated suite  rather than software vendors that only offer in store systems 
accordingly  we believe the long term prospects for our new ppos product and in store systems sales are promising  in part because we believe we are positioned to take advantage of this anticipated replacement cycle for point of sales systems that is driven by a shift to new technology platforms 
however  the timing and full impact of the replacement cycle is unclear 
we continue to invest in new product development 
we invested million in and approximately million from to in new product development and the acquisition of complementary products 
the acquisitions of arthur and timera see we continue to grow our business through acquisitions extended our product offerings in the retail enterprise systems and in store systems segments of our business 
the acquisitions of intactix  neovista decision series  e  vista  and engage not only have expanded our product offerings  but have also provided us with collaborative applications that address new vertical market opportunities with the manufacturers and wholesalers who supply our traditional retail customers 
we believe our strategy of expanding our product portfolio and increasing the scalability of our products has been the key element in attracting larger retail customers  and we believe that it has resulted in a steady pattern of new customers licensing multiple products  as well as enhanced back selling opportunities in our customer base 
we are developing a series of enhancements and the next generation of jda portfolio products  portfolio enabled  based primarily upon the 
net platform that we believe will position us uniquely in the retail and collaborative solutions markets 
we will continue to offer portfolio enabled applications that operate with other market accepted platforms such as oracle and the ibm iseries and  where appropriate  java based technology 
our goals are to ensure that our solutions offer i increased ease of use  ii increased integration of business processes  iii reduced cost of ownership  iv faster implementation  and v faster return on investment 
the initial versions of portfolio enabled solutions may not offer all the capabilities of the existing jda portfolio products  however  they will offer the advantages of an advanced technology platform and as a result  we believe they will be able to compete effectively against most of our competitors 
we will continue selling the legacy versions of these products until the functionality of the portfolio enabled solutions is at least equivalent 
consistent with our strategic operational plan for  we intend to leverage our past investment in product development by reducing somewhat our level of product development expenditures  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
at the close of  we were able to begin the process of transition to our new portfolio enabled solutions  and as a result  we can now start to reduce the double investment in products that we have endured over the past two years 
jda portfolio version  the fourth synchronized release of our products  will be released in first quarter and will include enhancements to virtually all of our existing products that will enable them to maintain their competitive edge 
in first quarter  we plan to begin releasing the first versions of the new portfolio enabled solutions that will eventually replace most of our existing products 
this has been a significant investment by the company as we have been building this next generation of products while developing jda portfolio version with the realignment of our resources at the end of we have now increased our focus on the development of the portfolio enabled solutions and will reduce our investment in existing jda portfolio products and leverage the most current release of these applications 
the jda portfolio investment protection program provides existing customers with a platform transfer right to the new 
net platform  if and when available  at no additional license fee under the following conditions i licensee is a current maintenance paying customer on their existing jda applications  ii licensee is not in breach of any terms of their agreements  iii the version of the product that will run on the 
net platform has no more than minimal differences in price  features  and functionality from the licensee s existing jda applications  and iv the licensee relinquishes all rights to use previously licensed software under the terms of the platform transfer right following a reasonable transition period 
if  however  the version of the product that will run on the 
net platform has more than minimal differences in price  features  and functionality  licensee may still exercise this right provided they agree to pay an additional fee equal to the price that would be charged to other existing users of licensee s current products to migrate to the new 
net platform 
customers will pay any required third party charges associated with the new platform 
we will encourage our customers to move to the 
net platform  however  at this time we are unable to estimate how many of our existing customers will take advantage of this program 
a similar investment protection program for in store systems customers was announced in that provides a platform transfer right from win dss to ppos 
as of december   approximately one third of our domestic win dss customers have indicated they intend to participate in the in store systems investment protection program 
we intend to continue to grow our business through acquisitions 
we believe there are opportunities to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary and synergistic companies  products and technologies 
we have historically looked at cash acquisitions in the million to million range that could be readily integrated  accretive to earnings  or that could shorten our time to market with new technologies 
we completed the purchase of timera in january for million 
we are now focusing our acquisition strategy on larger companies  particular those that will increase the breadth of our jda portfolio offerings in the collaborative solutions business segment 
we recorded two restructuring charges in we recorded a million restructuring charge in first quarter for million in one time termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of full time employees fte  primarily in sales fte and consulting services fte functions in the americas  europe and asia pacific  and  for closure costs of certain offices in the americas and europe that were either under performing or under utilized and used primarily by consulting services personnel 
all workforce reductions and office closures associated with this charge were made on or before march  we recorded a million restructuring charge in fourth quarter in connection with our announcement of our strategic operational plan for that includes a consolidation of product lines  a net workforce reduction of approximately or fte worldwide  and a reduction of certain office space 
the charge includes million in one time termination benefits related to the net workforce reduction that includes certain employees involved in the product development fte  consulting services and training fte  sales and marketing fte  and administrative fte functions in the americas  europe and asia pacific  offset by a net gain of fte in the customer support function resulting from the transfer of developers and functional experts into the new customer directed development cdd organization structure within our customer support solutions group 
the cdd group is responsible for improving the speed and efficiency of the company s issue resolution  support and enhancements for maintenance customers 
through december   fte have been terminated or open positions eliminated under this plan 
the remaining employees affected by this workforce reduction have been notified and are on various forms of stay put agreements that expire gradually over the first and second quarters of the fourth quarter charge also includes  for reduction of office space related primarily to the negotiated buyout or net rentals remaining under existing operating leases on certain facilities in northern europe that were vacated by december  jda anticipates that it will take an additional restructuring charge of approximately million to million in the first half of to complete the plan 
management believes the changes contemplated in our strategic operational plan for will allow the company to generate substantially higher profits at the revenue levels 
specifically  management believes the restructuring plan will enable jda to i streamline operations and reduce duplicate investments in product development by consolidating significant portions of the existing product suite on the 
net and java platforms used in the portfolio enabled products  ii maximize the return from the company s ongoing investments in advanced technology for the delivery of highly specialized services via the internet and internal administrative systems  and iii better align the company s operating strategies to identified growth areas in the market 
jda expects to realize an annualized cost reduction in the range of million to million 
we recorded a loss on impairment of our e trademarks 
we recorded a million impairment loss during fourth quarter on trademarks that were acquired from e corporation 
at december  the e trademarks had an estimated fair value of million 
the e trademarks are tested annually for impairment pursuant to sfas no 
and valued using the relief from royalty method of the income approach 
the premise of this valuation method is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the asset and assumes that in lieu of ownership  a firm would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset class 
the impairment loss results primarily from the lower software revenue forecast in the valuation compared to  and a more conservative annual growth rate 
the impairment loss does not impact our assessment that the e trademarks have indefinite lives as i our expected use of the e trademarks has not changed  ii there are no legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that limit their useful lives  iii there continues to be consistent demand for our strategic merchandise management solution application suite that includes the e products  and iv we intend to indefinitely develop next generation products under the e trademarks 
the impairment loss has been included in the consolidated statement of income for as a separate component of operating expenses under the caption loss on impairment of trademark 
in addition  for purposes of business segment disclosures  the impairment loss has been allocated to the retail enterprise systems  and collaborative solutions  business segments based on the initial allocation percentage used for this intangible asset at the date of acquisition 
termination of our agreement to acquire qrs corporation 
on september   qrs corporation qrs exercised its right to terminate our agreement and plan of merger dated june  merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal from an unrelated third party

we purchased our corporate office facility 
we purchased our corporate office facility in scottsdale  arizona on february  for million in cash 
the purchase includes the corporate office building  a new two story parking garage  and approximately acres of land upon which these structures are located 
this purchase resulted in a million decrease in our annual operating costs 
our financial position is strong and we have positive operating cash flow 
we continue to maintain a strong financial position during the difficult economic cycle of the last few years 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million at december  in addition  we generated million in positive cash flow from operations during compared to million in the purchase of our corporate office facility  together with the acquisition of timera  utilized million  or approximately of our december  cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances

we completed the purchase of timera in january for million 
we are now focusing our acquisition strategy on larger companies  particular those that will increase the breadth of our jda portfolio offerings in the collaborative solutions business segment 
any material acquisition could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
in addition  any material acquisitions of complementary or synergistic companies  products or technologies could require that we obtain additional equity financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us and would not result in additional dilution to our stockholders

contractual obligations 
the following summarizes known contractual obligations under capital and operating leases as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total year to years to years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases with minimum or remaining lease terms at december  we lease office space in the americas for regional sales and support offices across the united states  canada and latin america  and for international sales and support offices located in major cities throughout europe  asia  australia  and japan 
the leases are primarily non cancelable operating leases with initial terms ranging from months to months that expire at various dates through the year none of the leases contain contingent rental payments  however  certain of the leases contain insignificant scheduled rent increases and renewal options 
we expect that in the normal course of business some or all of these leases will be renewed or that suitable additional or alternative space will be available on commercially reasonable terms as needed 
in addition  we lease various computers  telephone systems  automobiles  and office equipment under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms generally ranging from to months 
certain of the equipment leases contain renewal options and we expect that in the normal course of business some or all of these leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  and net cash provided from operations will provide adequate liquidity to meet our normal operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
a major component of our positive cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable 
we invest our excess cash in short term  interest bearing instruments that have a low risk of capital loss  such as us government securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds  and money market securities 
commercial paper must be rated by of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
corporate bonds must be rated aa or aa or better by moody s and s p  respectively 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
there have been no changes in our critical accounting policies during the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses such as commissions and royalties 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
we license software primarily under non cancelable agreements and provide related services  including consulting  training and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  that provides further interpretive guidance for public companies on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
software license revenue is generally recognized using the residual method when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and a license agreement has been signed  delivery  which is typically fob shipping point  is complete  fees are fixed and determinable and there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  collection is considered probable  and vendor specific evidence of fair value vsoe exists for all undelivered elements 
our customer arrangements typically contain multiple elements that include software  options for future purchases of software products not previously licensed to the customer  maintenance  consulting and training services 
the fees from these arrangements are allocated to the various elements based on vsoe 
under the residual method  if an arrangement contains an undelivered element  the vsoe of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
if we are unable to determine vsoe for any undelivered element included in an arrangement  we will defer revenue recognition until all elements have been delivered 
in addition  if a software license contains milestones  customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  the software revenue is recognized upon the achievement of the milestone or upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
maintenance services are separately priced and stated in our arrangements 
maintenance services typically include on line support  access to our solution centers via telephone and web interfaces  comprehensive error diagnosis and correction  and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements  when and if we make them generally available 
maintenance services are generally billed on a monthly basis and recorded as revenue in the applicable month  or billed on an annual basis with the revenue initially deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
vsoe for maintenance services is the price customers will be required to pay when it is sold separately  typically the renewal rate 
consulting and training services are separately priced and stated in our arrangements  are generally available from a number of suppliers  and are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
consulting services include project management  system planning  design and implementation  customer configurations  and training 
these services are generally billed bi weekly on an hourly basis or pursuant to the terms of a fixed price contract 
consulting services revenue billed on an hourly basis is recognized as the work is performed 
under fixed price contracts  including milestone based arrangements  consulting services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting described in statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  by relating hours incurred to date to total estimated hours at completion 
training revenues are included in consulting revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income and are recognized once the training services are provided 
vsoe for consulting and training services is based upon the hourly or per class rates charged when those services are sold separately 
revenues from our hardware reseller business are also included in consulting revenues  reported net ie  the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to the supplier pursuant to eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and recognized upon shipment of the hardware 
customers are reviewed for creditworthiness before we enter into a new arrangement that provides for software and or a service element 
we do not sell or ship our software  nor recognize any license revenue unless we believe that collection is probable 
payments for our software licenses are typically due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
although infrequent  where software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
accounts receivable 
consistent with industry practice and to be competitive in the retail software marketplace  we typically provide installment payment terms on most software license sales 
software licenses are generally due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
customers are reviewed for creditworthiness before we enter into a new arrangement that provides for software and or a service element 
we do not sell or ship our software  nor recognize any license revenue unless we believe that collection is probable in accordance with the requirements of paragraph in statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
for those customers who are not credit worthy  we require prepayment of the software license fee or a letter of credit before we will ship our software 
we have a history of collecting software payments when they come due without providing refunds or concessions 
consulting services are generally billed bi weekly and maintenance services are billed annually or monthly 
if a customer becomes significantly delinquent or their credit deteriorates  we put the account on hold and do not recognize any further services revenue and in most cases we withdraw support and or our implementation staff until the situation has been resolved 
we do not have significant billing or collection problems 
we review each past due account and provide specific reserves based upon the information we gather from various sources including our customers  subsequent cash receipts  consulting services project teams  members of each region s management  and credit rating services such as dun and bradstreet 
although infrequent and unpredictable  from time to time certain of our customers have filed bankruptcy  and we have been required to refund the pre petition amounts collected and settle for less than the face value of their remaining receivable pursuant to a bankruptcy court order 
in these situations  as soon as it becomes probable that the net realizable value of the receivable is impaired  we provide reserves on the receivable 
in addition  we monitor economic conditions in the various geographic regions in which we operate to determine if general reserves or adjustments to our credit policy in a region are appropriate for deteriorating conditions that may impact the net realizable value of our receivables 
goodwill and intangible assets 
our business combinations typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets and the annual impairment tests required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires management to make estimates of future revenues  customer retention rates and other assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of future cash flows under the discounted cash flow method of the income approach to the carrying value of goodwill allocated to our reporting units 
we found no indication of goodwill impairment in our reporting units in  or substantially all of our trademarks were acquired in connection with the acquisition of e beginning january   we assigned indefinite useful lives to our trademarks  and ceased amortization  as we believe there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic  or other factors that would limit their useful lives 
in addition  we intend to indefinitely develop next generation products under our trademarks and expect them to contribute to our cash flows indefinitely 
a million impairment loss was recorded in fourth quarter on trademarks that were acquired from e trademarks are tested annually for impairment using the relief from royalty method of the income approach 
the premise of this valuation method is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the asset and assumes that in lieu of ownership  a firm would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset class 
the impairment loss resulted primarily from the lower software revenue forecast used by the company in the valuation compared to  and a more conservative annual growth rate 
product development 
the costs to develop new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
we consider technological feasibility to have occurred when all planning  designing  coding and testing have been completed according to design specifications 
once technological feasibility is established  any additional costs would be capitalized 
we believe our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility  and accordingly  no costs have been capitalized 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required 
stock based compensation

r  share based payment sfas no 
r which is a revision of sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
and sfas no 
 and amends statement of financial accounting standard no 
 statement of cash flows sfas no 

generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
 however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r on july  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method could potentially have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and earnings per share above and in notes to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current authoritative literature 
this requirement will reduce net cash flows from operating activities in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because this would depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were   and million in  and  respectively 
on february   the compensation committee of our board of directors the committee approved the immediate vesting of all unvested stock options previously awarded to employees  officers and directors 
the accelerated options were issued under our stock option plan  stock option plan  outside director stock option plan and non statutory stock option plan 
the committee made the decision to immediately vest these options based in part on the issuance of sfas no 
r 
the committee also considered the reduced level of cash bonuses paid to employees and officers in  the fact that there are no equity awards planned in  other than for certain new hires  and recognized that the exercise of any accelerated options would bring cash into the company 
absent the acceleration of these options  upon adoption of sfas no 
r on july   we would have been required to recognize approximately million in pre tax compensation expense from these options over their remaining vesting terms 
by vesting all previously unvested options  the stock based compensation expense under sfas no 
will only be reflected in our footnote disclosures 
further  we believe the future stock based compensation expense to be recorded under sfas no 
r related to these options is significantly reduced and would be immaterial to our financial results 
however  there can be no assurance that these actions will avoid the recognition of future compensation expense in connection with these options 
employees  officers and directors will benefit from the accelerated vesting of their stock options in the event they terminate their employment with or service to the company prior to the completion of the original vesting terms as they would have the ability to exercise certain options that would have otherwise been forfeited 
no stock based compensation expense will be recorded with respect to these options unless an employee  officer or director actually benefits from this modification 
for those employees  officers and directors who do benefit from the accelerated vesting  we are required to record additional stock based compensation expense equal to the intrinsic value of the option on the date of modification ie  february  
the closing market price per share of our common stock on february  was and the exercise prices of the approximately million in unvested options on that date ranged from to 
based on our historical employee turnover rates during the past three years  we currently estimate the potential additional stock based compensation expense we may be required to record with respect to these options is approximately  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we use derivative financial instruments  primarily forward exchange contracts  to manage a majority of the foreign currency exchange exposure associated with net short term foreign denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the exposures relate primarily to the gain or loss recognized in earnings from the revaluation or settlement of current foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than days  and are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  with gains and losses recognized in other income offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
we recorded foreign currency exchange gains in  and of   and  respectively 
other recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments  as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued staff position eitf  which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf to investments in securities that are impaired 
we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that exchanges of nonmonetary assets are to be measured based on fair value and eliminates the exception for exchanges of nonmonetary  similar productive assets  and adds an exemption for nonmonetary exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
we do not participate in the exchange of nonmonetary assets 
factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for the year then ended contained elsewhere in this form k 
regional and or global changes in economic  political and market conditions could cause decreases in demand for our software and related services which could negatively affect our revenue and operating results and the market price of our stock 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our software and related services 
a regional and or global change in the economy and financial markets could result in delay or cancellation of customer purchases 
historically  developments associated with terrorist attacks on united states interests  the us war and continued violence in iraq  natural catastrophes or contagious diseases such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars have resulted in economic  political and other uncertainties  and factors such as these could further adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results 
if demand for our software and related services decrease  our revenues would decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected which  in turn  may cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could adversely affect the price of our stock 
our quarterly operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary in the future 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet management s or analysts expectations  the price of our stock could decline 
many factors may cause these fluctuations  including demand for our software products and services  including the size and timing of individual contracts and our ability to recognize revenue with respect to contracts signed in the quarter  particularly with respect to our larger customers  changes in the length and complexity of our sales cycle  competitive pricing pressures and the competitive success or failure on significant transactions  customer order deferrals resulting from the anticipation of new products  economic uncertainty  disappointing operating results by the customer  or otherwise  the timing of new software product and technology introductions and enhancements to our software products or those of our competitors  and market acceptance of our new software products and technology  changes in the number  size or timing of new and renewal maintenance contracts or cancellations  changes in our operating expenses  changes in the mix of domestic and international revenues  or expansion or contraction of international operations  our ability to complete fixed price consulting contracts within budget  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  operational issues resulting from corporate reorganizations  and lower than anticipated utilization in our consulting services group as a result of reduced levels of software sales  reduced implementation times for our products  changes in the mix of demand for our software products  or other reasons 
we made certain decisions in fourth quarter regarding our cost structure and the rate of investment in new product development for certain purchased software 
these decisions caused us to reduce our analysis of projected cash flows from certain affected products and required that we record a million impairment loss on the trademarks we acquired from e corporation 
there can be no assurance that any future decisions we make regarding our cost structure and rate of investment in new product development will not result in additional write downs or impairment charges that will adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
our stock price has been and may remain volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations 
examples of factors that we believe have caused fluctuations in our stock price in the past include the following cancelled or delayed purchasing decisions  the millennium change  conversion to the euro currency  external and internal marketing issues  announcements of reduced visibility and increased uncertainty concerning future demand for our products  increased competition  elongated sales cycles  a limited number of reference accounts with implementations in the early years of product release  certain design and stability issues in early versions of our products  and lack of desired features and functionality 
in addition  fluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits 
defending against such lawsuits could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
furthermore  any settlement or adverse determination of these lawsuits could subject us to significant liabilities 
our gross margins may vary significantly or decline 
because the gross margins on product revenues software licenses and maintenance services are significantly greater than the gross margins on consulting services revenue  our combined gross margin has fluctuated from quarter to quarter and it may continue to fluctuate significantly based on revenue mix 
demand for the implementation of products with longer implementation timeframes  specifically merchandise operations systems and in store systems  remains depressed 
we believe that demand continues to be greater for products that have a higher short term roi and lower total costs ownership with less disruption to the underlying business of our customers 
as a result  most of our current implementations are for our strategic merchandise management solutions that have shorter implementation timeframes 
the decline in software sales of merchandise operations systems and in store systemscontinues to have a corollary negative impact on our service revenues as consulting services revenue typically lags the performance of software revenues by as much as one year 
in addition  our gross margins on consulting services revenue vary significantly with the rates at which we utilize our consulting personnel  and as a result  our overall gross margins will be adversely affected when there is not enough work to keep our consultants busy 
we may face some constraints on our ability to adjust consulting service headcount and expense to meet demand  due in part to our need to retain consulting personnel with sufficient skill sets to implement and maintain our full set of products 
we may misjudge when software sales will be realized 
software license revenues in any quarter depend substantially upon contracts signed and the related shipment of software in that quarter 
it is therefore difficult for us to accurately predict software license revenues 
because of the timing of our sales  we typically recognize the substantial majority of our software license revenues in the last weeks or days of the quarter  and we may derive a significant portion of our quarterly software license revenues from a small number of relatively large sales 
in addition  it is difficult to forecast the timing of large individual software license sales with a high degree of certainty due to the extended length of the sales cycle and the generally more complex contractual terms that may be associated with such licenses that could result in the deferral of some or all of the revenue to future periods 
accordingly  large individual sales have sometimes occurred in quarters subsequent to when we anticipated 
although our new proof of concept sales model may improve our ability to predict the timing of certain deals  we expect to experience continued difficulty in accurately forecasting the timing of deals 
if we receive any significant cancellation or deferral of customer orders  or we are unable to conclude license negotiations by the end of a fiscal quarter  our operating results may be lower than anticipated 
in addition  any weakening or uncertainty in the economy may make it more difficult for us to predict quarterly results in the future  and could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition for an indefinite period of time 
we may not be able to reduce expense levels if our revenues decline 
our expense levels are based on our expectations of future revenues 
since software license sales are typically accompanied by a significant amount of consulting and maintenance services  the size of our services organization must be managed to meet our anticipated software license revenues 
we have also made a strategic decision to make a significant investment in new product development 
as a result  we hire and train service personnel and incur research and development costs in advance of anticipated software license revenues 
if software license revenues fall short of our expectations  or if we are unable to fully utilize our service personnel  our operating results are likely to decline because a significant portion of our expenses cannot be quickly reduced to respond to any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we are dependent upon the retail industry 
historically  we have derived over of our revenues from the license of software products and the performance of related services to retail customers  and our future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to retail customers 
the acquisitions of arthur and timera extended our product offerings in the retail enterprise systems and in store systems segments of our business 
the acquisitions of intactix  neovista decision series  e  vista  and engage not only have expanded our product offerings  but have also provided us with collaborative applications that address new vertical market opportunities with the manufacturers and wholesalers who supply our traditional retail customers 
the success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry  which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions 
in addition  we believe that the licensing of certain of our software products involves a large capital expenditure  which is often accompanied by large scale hardware purchases or other capital commitments 
as a result  demand for our products and services could decline in the event of instability or potential downturns 
we believe the retail industry remains cautious with their level of investment in information technology during the difficult economic cycle of the last few years  and the uncertainty related to the threat of future terrorist attacks and any continued violence in iraq 
we remain concerned about weak and uncertain economic conditions  consolidations and the disappointing results of retailers in certain of our geographic regions 
the retail industry will be negatively impacted if weak economic conditions or fear of additional terrorists attacks and wars persist for an extended period of time 
weak and uncertain economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  including a potential deterioration of our maintenance revenue base as customers look to reduce their costs  elongate our selling cycles  and delay  suspend or reduce the demand for our products 
as a result  it is difficult in the current economic environment to predict exactly when specific software licenses will close within a six to nine month time frame 
in addition  weak and uncertain economic conditions could impair our customers ability to pay for our products or services 
any of these factors could adversely impact our business  quarterly or annual operating results and financial condition 
we also believe that the retail industry may be consolidating  and that the industry is currently experiencing increased competition in certain geographical regions that could negatively impact the industry and our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
such consolidation has in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  reduce the demand for our products and may negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
there may be an increase in customer bankruptcies due to weak economic conditions 
we have in the past and may in the future be impacted by customer bankruptcies that occur in periods subsequent to the software license sale 
during weak economic conditions  such as those currently being experienced in our international regions  there is an increased risk that certain of our customers will file bankruptcy 
when our customers file bankruptcy  we may be required to forego collection of pre petition amounts owed and to repay amounts remitted to us during the day preference period preceding the filing 
accounts receivable balances related to pre petition amounts may in certain of these instances be large due to extended payment terms for software license fees  and significant billings for consulting and implementation services on large projects 
the bankruptcy laws  as well as the specific circumstances of each bankruptcy  may severely limit our ability to collect pre petition amounts  and may force us to disgorge payments made during the day preference period 
we also face risk from international customers that file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions  in that the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be more difficult to predict 
although we believe that we have sufficient reserves to cover anticipated customer bankruptcies  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate  and if they are not adequate  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled personnel 
our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate skilled personnel  including sales and marketing representatives  qualified software engineers involved in ongoing product development  and consulting personnel who assist in the implementation of our products and services 
the market for such individuals is competitive 
for example  it may be particularly difficult to attract and retain product development personnel experienced in the microsoft 
net platform since the 
net platform is a new and evolving technology 
given the critical roles of our sales  product development and consulting staffs  our inability to recruit successfully or any significant loss of key personnel would hurt us 
a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel characterize the software industry 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our current personnel  attract and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future  or be able to assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses 
we will continue to adjust the size and composition of the workforce in our services organization to match the different product and geographic demand cycles 
if we were unable to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel  or assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we have only deployed certain of our software products on a limited basis  and have not yet deployed some software products that are important to our future growth 
certain of our software products  including portfolio point of sale  portfolio workforce management  portfolio registry  trade events management  portfolio replenishment optimization by e and certain modules of portfolio crm and intellect  have been commercially released within the last two years 
in addition  we have only recently announced our intentions to develop or acquire a series of business to business e commerce solutions  including products in furtherance of our pursuit of the market for collaborative solutions 
the markets for these products are new and evolving  and we believe that retailers and their suppliers may be cautious in adopting web based and other new technologies 
consequently  we cannot predict the growth rate  if any  and size of the markets for our e commerce products or that these markets will continue to develop 
potential and existing customers may find it difficult  or be unable  to successfully implement our e commerce products  or may not purchase our products for a variety of reasons  including their inability or unwillingness to deploy sufficient internal personnel and computing resources for a successful implementation 
in addition  we must overcome significant obstacles to successfully market our newer products  including limited experience of our sales and consulting personnel 
if the markets for our newer products fail to develop  develop more slowly or differently than expected or become saturated with competitors  or if our products are not accepted in the marketplace or are technically flawed  our business  operating results and financial condition will decline 
we are investing heavily in re writing many of our products for the microsoft 
net platform 
we are developing a series of enhancements and the next generation of jda portfolio products  portfolio enabled  based upon the 
net platform that we believe will position us uniquely in the retail and collaborative solutions markets 
we will continue to offer portfolio enabled applications that operate with other market accepted platforms such as oracle and the ibm iseries and  where appropriate  java based technology 
our goals are to ensure that our solutions offer i increased ease of use  ii increased integration of business processes  iii reduced cost of ownership  iv faster implementation  and v faster return on investment 
we believe our next generation technology will enhance our competitive position since we will be able to offer significant features and functionality using an advanced technology platform 
the initial versions of portfolio enabled solutions may not offer all the capabilities of the existing jda portfolio products  however  they will offer the advantages of an advanced technology platform and as a result  we believe they will be able to compete effectively against most of our competitors 
we will continue selling the legacy versions of these products until the functionality of the portfolio enabled solutions is at least equivalent 
at the close of  we were able to begin the process of transition to our new portfolio enabled solutions  and as a result  we can now start to reduce the double investment in products that we have endured over the past two years 
jda portfolio version  the fourth synchronized release of our products  will be released in first quarter and will include enhancements to virtually all of our existing products that will enable them to maintain their competitive edge 
in first quarter  we also plan to begin releasing the first versions of the new portfolio enabled solutions that will eventually replace most of our existing products 
this has been a significant investment by the company as we have been building our next generation of products while developing jda portfolio version we also plan to develop new products as well as shared code components using the 
net platform 
the risks of our commitment to the 
net platform include  but are not limited to  the following the possibility that it may be more difficult than we currently anticipate to develop our products for the 
net platform  and we could incur costs in excess of our projections to complete the planned transition of our product suite  the possibility that prospective customers will refrain from purchasing the current versions of products to be re written because they are waiting for the 
net platform versions  the possibility that our 
net platform beta customers will not become favorable reference sites  adequate scalability of the 
net platform for our largest customers  the possibility we may not complete the transition to the 
net platform in the time frame we currently expect  the ability of our development staff to learn how to efficiently and effectively develop products using the 
net platform  our ability to transition our customer base onto the 
net platform when it is available  the possibility that it may take several quarters for our consulting and support organizations to be fully trained and proficient on this new technology and as a result  we may encounter difficulties implementing and supporting new products or versions of existing products based on the 
net platform  we may be required to supplement our consulting and support organizations with 
net proficient resources from our product development teams to support early 
net implementations which could impact our development schedule for the release of additional 
net products  microsoft s ability to achieve market acceptance of the 
net platform  delays in microsoft s ability to commercially release necessary components for deployment of our applications  and microsoft s continued commitment to enhancing and marketing the 
net platform 
the risk associated with developing products that utilize new technologies remains high 
despite our increasing confidence in this investment and our efforts to mitigate the risks of the 
net platform project  there can be no assurances that our efforts to re write many of our current products and to develop new portfolio enabled solutions using the 
net platform will be successful 
if the 
net platform project is not successful  it likely will have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  we cannot assure you that  even if we successfully re write our portfolio enabled solutions products on the 
net platform  that these re written products will achieve market acceptance 
we may introduce new lines of business where we are less experienced 
we may introduce new lines of business that are outside our traditional focus on software licenses and related maintenance and implementation services 
introducing new lines of business involves a number of uncertainties  including a lack of internal resources and expertise to operate and grow such new lines of business  immature internal processes and controls  inexperience predicting revenues and expenses for the new lines of business  and the possibility that such new lines of business will divert management attention and resources from our traditional business 
the inability of management to effectively develop and operate these new lines of business could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  we may not be able gain acceptance of any new lines of business in our markets  penetrate new markets successfully  or obtain the anticipated or desired benefits of such new lines of business 
there are many risks associated with international operations 
our international revenues represented of total revenues in as compared to and in and  respectively 
if our international operations grow  we would need to recruit and hire a number of new consulting  sales and marketing and support personnel in the countries in which we have or will establish offices 
entry into new international markets typically requires the establishment of new marketing and distribution channels as well as the development and subsequent support of localized versions of our software 
international introductions of our products often require a significant investment in advance of anticipated future revenues 
in addition  the opening of a new office typically results in initial recruiting and training expenses and reduced labor efficiencies associated with the introduction of products to a new market 
if we are less successful in a new market than we expect  we may not be able to realize an adequate return on our initial investment and our operating results could suffer 
if we have to downsize certain international operations  the costs to do so are typically much higher than downsizing costs in the united states  particularly in europe 
we cannot guarantee that the countries in which we operate will have a sufficient pool of qualified personnel from which to hire  that we will be successful at hiring  training or retaining such personnel or that we can expand or contract our international operations in a timely  cost effective manner 
our international business operations are subject to risks associated with international activities  including currency fluctuations  higher operating costs due to local laws or regulations  unexpected changes in employment and other regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries  potentially negative tax consequences  difficulties in staffing and managing geographically disparate operations  greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  licensing and other trade restrictions  ability to negotiate and have enforced favorable contract provisions  repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  anti american sentiment due to the war with iraq  and other american policies that may be unpopular in certain regions  the effects of regional and global infectious diseases such as sars  the challenges of finding qualified management for our international operations  and general economic conditions in international markets 
consulting services in support of certain international software licenses typically have lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to generally lower billing rates and or higher costs in certain of our international markets 
accordingly  any significant growth in our international operations may result in declines in gross margins on consulting services 
we expect that an increasing portion of our international software license  consulting services and maintenance services revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
if we expand our international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
we use derivative financial instruments  primarily forward exchange contracts  to manage a majority of the foreign currency exchange exposure associated with net short term foreign denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
we cannot guarantee that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  revenues earned in various countries where we do business may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  which would reduce our earnings 
we may face difficulties in our highly competitive markets 
we encounter competitive products from a different set of vendors in each of our primary product categories 
we believe that while our markets are still subject to intense competition  the number of significant competitors in many of our application markets has diminished over the past five years 
we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are feature and functionality  product reputation and quality of reference accounts  vendor viability  retail and demand chain industry expertise  total solution cost  technology platform and quality of customer support 
our retail enterprise systems compete primarily with internally developed systems and other third party developers such as ac nielsen corporation  aldata solutions  alphameric plc  connect systems  inc  evant  inc  island pacific  inc  manugistics group  inc  micro strategies incorporated  nsb retail systems plc  retek  inc  sap ag and sas marketmax 
in addition  new competitors may enter our markets and offer merchandise management systems that target the retail industry 
the competition for our in store systems is more fragmented than the competition for our retail enterprise systems 
we compete primarily with smaller point of sale focused companies such as crs business computers  kronos incorporated  micro systems  inc  radiant systems  inc  retalix  ltd  commerce  tomax technologies  triversity  inc  workbrain  inc  and workplace systems interna tional 
we also compete with other broad solution set providers such as nsb retail systems plc  retek  inc  and sap ag campbell software division 
our current collaborative solutions compete primarily with products from ac nielsen corporation  evant inc  i technologies  information resources  inc  manugistics group  inc 
and sas marketmax 
in the market for consulting services  we have pursued a strategy of forming informal working relationships with leading retail systems integrators such as ibm global services  cap gemini ernst young  kurt salmon associates and lakewest consulting 
these integrators  as well as independent consulting firms such as accenture  aig netplex  cft consulting  spl and id applications  also represent competition to our consulting services group 
moreover  because many of these consulting firms are involved in advising our prospective customers in the software selection process  they may successfully encourage a prospective customer to select software from a software company with whom they have a relationship 
examples of such relationships between consulting firms and software companies include the relationship between retek  inc and accenture 
as we continue to develop or acquire e commerce products and expand our business in the collaborative solutions area  we expect to face potential competition from business to business e commerce application providers  including ariba  commercialware  demantra  inc  ecometry corporation  i technologies  manugistics group  inc  microsoft  inc  retek  inc and sap ag 
a few of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage over us 
for example  we have recently encountered competitive situations with sap ag where  in order to expedite their entrance into our markets and to encourage customers to purchase licenses of its non retail applications  sap ag has offered to license at no charge certain of its retail software applications that compete with the jda portfolio products 
in addition  we could face competition from large  multi industry technology companies that have historically not offered an enterprise solution set to the retail supply chain market 
further  the enterprise software market is consolidating and this may result in larger  new competitors with greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we possess 
such a consolidation could negatively impact our business 
this consolidation trend is evidenced by sap ag s announcement on february  of a cash tender offer to purchase all of retek  inc s outstanding shares  which was followed on march  by a competing cash tender offer from oracle corporation to purchase all of retek  inc s outstanding shares 
oracle corporation does not currently compete with our retail specific products 
it is difficult to estimate what effect either of these proposed acquisitions  if finalized  would have on our competitive environment 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors  or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
it may be difficult to identify  adopt and develop product architecture that is compatible with emerging industry standards 
the markets for our software products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
we continuously evaluate new technologies and implement into our products advanced technology such as our current 
net platform effort 
however  if we fail in our product development efforts to accurately address in a timely manner  evolving industry standards  new technology advancements or important third party interfaces or product architectures  sales of our products and services will suffer 
our software products can be licensed with a variety of popular industry standard platforms  and are authored in various development environments using different programming languages and underlying databases and architectures 
there may be future or existing platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace that may not be compatible with our software product design 
developing and maintaining consistent software product performance across various technology platforms could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may have difficulty implementing our products 
our software products are complex and perform or directly affect mission critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the enterprise 
consequently  implementation of our software products can be a lengthy process  and commitment of resources by our clients is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control 
although average implementation times have recently declined  we believe the implementation of the unix oracle versions of our products can be longer and more complicated than our other applications as they typically i appeal to larger retailers who have multiple divisions requiring multiple implementation projects  ii require the execution of implementation procedures in multiple layers of software  iii offer a retailer more deployment options and other configuration choices  and iv may involve third party integrators to change business processes concurrent with the implementation of the software 
delays in the implementations of any of our software products  whether by our business partners or us  may result in client dissatisfaction  disputes with our customers  or damage to our reputation 
there is also a risk that it may take several quarters for our consulting and support organizations to be fully trained and proficient on the new 
net technology platform and as a result  we may encounter difficulties implementing and supporting new products or versions of existing products based on the 
net platform 
in addition  we may be required to supplement our consulting and support organizations with 
net proficient resources from our product development teams to support early 
net implementations which could impact our development schedule for the release of additional 
net products 
significant problems implementing our software therefore  can cause delays or prevent us from collecting license fees for our software and can damage our ability to get new business 
as a result of our aggressive management of the utilization of our consulting and support personnel  including recent headcount reductions undertaken in the fourth quarter of  we face the risk of constraints in our services offerings in the event of greater than anticipated licensing activity or more complex implementation projects 
we may not achieve the desired results from our epathways implementation methodology 
we have invested in the development of an epathways methodology with the objective of optimizing the delivery of services related to shorter implementation cycle projects typically associated with our portfolio space management  portfolio planning and portfolio replenishment applications  and improving our utilization rates 
a key facet of this methodology involves the delivery of services through the internet using industry standard technology 
there can be no assurance that the epathways methodology can be successfully implemented within our service organization  that customers will readily accept this method of delivery of our services  or that our utilization rates will improve 
if we are unsuccessful implementing the epathways methodology  or the timeframe for its full roll out is extended  and our utilization rates do not improve  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our fixed price service contracts may result in losses 
we offer a combination of software products  consulting and maintenance services to our customers 
historically  we have entered into service agreements with our customers that provide for consulting services on a time and expenses basis 
we believe our competitors may be offering customers fixed price service contracts in order to differentiate their product and service offerings 
as a result  we are increasingly required during negotiations with customers to enter into fixed price service contracts which link services payments  and occasionally software payments  to implementation milestones 
fixed bid consulting services work represented of total consulting services revenue in compared to in if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations under fixed price contracts within our estimated cost structure  our operating results could suffer 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
our success and competitive position is dependent in part upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspect of our technology 
the reverse engineering  unauthorized copying  or other misappropriation of our technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying for it 
we rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we seek to protect the source code to our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
to date  we have not protected our technology with issued patents  although we do have several patent applications pending 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we license our software products under signed license agreements that impose restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software and do not permit the re sale  sublicense or other transfer of the source code 
finally  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and independent consultants to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software and internet industries regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future software solutions or we infringe on their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of e commerce products will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
moreover  as software patents become more common  the likelihood increases that a patent holder will bring an infringement action against us  or against our customers  to whom we have indemnification obligations 
in addition  we may find it necessary to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to protect our trade secrets 
since we resell hardware  we may also become subject to claims from third parties that the hardware  or the combination of hardware and software  infringe their intellectual property 
although we may disclaim certain intellectual property representations to our customers  these disclaimers may not be sufficient to fully protect us against such claims 
we may be more vulnerable to patent claims since we do not have any issued patents that we can assert defensively against a patent infringement claim 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we lose access to critical third party software or technology  our costs could increase and the introduction of new products and product enhancements could be delayed  potentially hurting our competitive position 
we license and integrate technology from third parties in certain of our software products 
for example  we license the uniface client server application development technology from compuware  inc for use in portfolio merchandise management  certain applications from silvon software  inc for use in performance analysis by ideas  ibm s net 
commerce merchant server software for use in customer order management  and the syncsort application for use in certain of the portfolio planning by arthur products 
our third party licenses generally require us to pay royalties and fulfill confidentiality obligations 
if we are unable to continue to license any of this third party software  or if the third party licensors do not adequately maintain or update their products  we would face delays in the releases of our software until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed or developed  and integrated into our software products 
these delays  if they occur  could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is also possible that intellectual property acquired from third parties through acquisitions  mergers  licenses or otherwise may not have been adequately protected  or infringes another parties intellectual property rights 
we may face liability if our products are defective or if we make errors implementing our products 
our software products are highly complex and sophisticated 
as a result  they may occasionally contain design defects or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
in addition  implementation of our products may involve customer specific configuration by third parties or us  and may involve integration with systems developed by third parties 
in particular  it is common for complex software programs  such as our unix oracle and e commerce software products  to contain undetected errors when first released 
they are discovered only after the product has been implemented and used over time with different computer systems and in a variety of applications and environments 
despite extensive testing  we have in the past discovered certain defects or errors in our products or custom configurations only after our software products have been used by many clients 
for example  we will likely experience undetected errors in our 
net applications as we begin to implement them for the first time at customer sites 
in addition  our clients may occasionally experience difficulties integrating our products with other hardware or software in their environment that are unrelated to defects in our products 
such defects  errors or difficulties may cause future delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications or impair customer satisfaction with our products 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required to remain competitive  and that speed to market is critical to our success 
our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to enhance our existing products through internal development and strategic partnering  internally develop new products which leverage both our existing customers and sales force  and strategically acquire complementary retail point and collaborative solutions that add functionality for specific business processes to an enterprise wide system 
if clients experience significant problems with implementation of our products or are otherwise dissatisfied with their functionality or performance or if they fail to achieve market acceptance for any reason  our market reputation could suffer  and we could be subject to claims for significant damages 
although our customer agreements contain limitation of liability clauses and exclude consequential damages  there can be no assurances that such contract provisions will be enforced 
any such damages claim could impair our market reputation and could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our performance depends in large part on the continued performance of our executive officers and other key employees  particularly the performance and services of james d 
armstrong our chairman and hamish n 
j 
brewer our chief executive officer 
we do not have in place key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of mr 
armstrong  mr 
brewer  or other key executive officers or employees without a successor in place  or any difficulties associated with our succession  could negatively affect our financial performance 
we may have difficulty integrating acquisitions 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies  including those that are significant in size and scope 
in pursuit of our strategy to acquire complementary products  we have completed nine acquisitions over the past seven years including the arthur retail business unit in june  intactix international  inc in april  e corporation in september  and substantially all the assets of timera texas  inc in january the e acquisition was our largest to date  and involved the integration of e s products and operations in countries 
the risks we commonly encounter in acquisitions include we may have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  the challenge to integrate new products and technologies into our sales and marketing process  particularly in the case of smaller acquisitions  we may have difficulty effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  our ongoing business may be disrupted by transition and integration issues  we may not be able to retain key technical and managerial personnel from the acquired business  we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  we may have difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies during the transition and integration  our relationships with partner companies or third party providers of technology or products could be adversely affected  our relationships with employees and customers could be impaired  our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  legal contingencies  and product development  among other things  we may be subject to as a successor  certain liabilities of our acquisition targets  and we may be required to sustain significant exit or impairment charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and stockholders rights plan and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation  which authorizes the issuance of blank check preferred stock  our stockholders rights plan which permits our stockholders to counter takeover attempts  and delaware state corporate laws which restrict business combinations between a corporation and or more owners of outstanding voting stock of the corporation for a three year period  individually or in combination  may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a jda stockholder may consider favorable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and other regulations and restrictions 
foreign currency exchange rates 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
international revenues represented of our total revenues in  as compared to and in and  respectively 
in addition  the identifiable net assets of our foreign operations totaled of consolidated net assets at december   as compared to at december  our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business 
we operate outside the united states primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  asia pacific  canada and latin america 
we have determined that the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency and as such  foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign subsidiaries resulted in our reporting unrealized foreign currency exchange gains of million in and million in foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of our exposures from foreign net working capital as of december  to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates 
based upon the results of these analyses  a adverse change in all foreign currency rates from the december  rates would result in a currency translation loss of million before tax 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
we use derivative financial instruments  primarily forward exchange contracts  to manage a majority of the foreign currency exchange exposure associated with net short term foreign denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the exposures relate primarily to the gain or loss recognized in earnings from the revaluation or settlement of current foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than days  and are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  with gains and losses recognized in other income offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
at december   we had forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million and an associated net forward contract liability of  at december   we had forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million and an associated net forward contract liability of  the net forward contract liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the notional value represents the amount of foreign currencies to be purchased or sold at maturity and does not represent our exposure on these contracts 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our forward exchange contracts at december  based on the results of these analyses  a adverse change in all foreign currency rates from the december  rates would result in a net forward contract liability of  that would offset the underlying currency translation loss on our net foreign assets 
we recorded foreign currency exchange gains in  and of   and  respectively 
interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits and variable and fixed rate obligations of the us government and its agencies  states  municipalities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank 
interest income earned on our investments is reflected in our financial statements under the caption other income  net 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have suffered a decline in market value due to a change in interest rates 
we hold our investment securities for purposes other than trading 
the fair value of securities held at december  was million  which is approximately the same as amortized cost  with interest rates generally ranging between and
