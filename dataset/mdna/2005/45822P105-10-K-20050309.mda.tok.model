item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction wps resources wps resources is a holding company that is exempt from the public utility holding company act of our wholly owned subsidiaries include two regulated utilities  wpsc which is an operating entity as well as a holding company exempt from the public utility holding company act of and uppco 
another wholly owned subsidiary  wps resources capital corporation  is a holding company for our nonregulated businesses  including esi and pdi 
our regulated and nonregulated businesses have distinct competencies and business strategies  offer differing products and services  experience a wide array of risks and challenges  and are viewed uniquely by management 
the following summary provides a strategic overview and insight into the operations of our subsidiaries 
strategic overview the focal point of wps resources business plan is the creation of long term value for our shareholders through growth  operational excellence  and asset management and the continued emphasis on reliable  competitively priced  and environmentally sound energy services for our customers 
we are seeking a balanced portfolio of utility and nonregulated growth  but we are placing emphasis on regulated growth 
a discussion of the essential components of our business plan is set forth below maintain a strong utility base as discussed above  we are focusing on growth in our utility operations 
a strong utility base is important in order to maintain quality credit ratings  which are critical to our success 
in  wpsc signed contracts with several wholesale customers in order to bolster growth beyond our normal utility growth rate  and wpsc is also expanding its generation fleet in order to meet growing electric demand and ensure the continued reliability of our energy services 
wpsc entered into long term power sale agreements with two wholesale customers in one is for consolidated water power company s full requirements service between and megawatts of firm load through december  the other is a megawatt agreement with wisconsin public power inc beginning may   and ending april  in october  wpsc began construction of its megawatt coal fired weston base load power plant near wausau  wisconsin  and announced in may that it would pursue plans to build a jointly owned megawatt base load electric plant with wisconsin power and light 
the weston power plant is expected to be operational in calpine corporation s megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired generating facility fox energy center in kaukauna  wisconsin  is expected to be placed in service in june wpsc has contracted for approximately megawatts of this plant s output over a year period 
wpsc also contracted to purchase megawatts of wind generation over a year period from the forward energy wind project in brownsville  wisconsin 
both of these agreements were signed as a means of seeking the most cost effective mix of energy resources to meet growing electric demand 
integrate resources to provide operational excellence wps resources is committed to integrating the resources of its business units in accordance with any applicable regulatory restrictions by leveraging their individual capabilities and expertise across the company 
effective august  in an effort to better manage the market risks associated with pdi s merchant generation plants  we restructured the management of our two nonregulated business units esi and pdi and currently have one executive management team overseeing the operations of these two business units 
in january  esi implemented strategies to optimize the value of pdi s merchant generation fleet and has reduced the market price risk while extracting additional value from these plants  through the use of various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts  options  and swaps 
prior to leveraging esi s energy marketing expertise  pdi sold uncontracted energy into liquid financial markets at spot prices or day ahead prices  which provided less predictable revenue and margin 
strategically grow nonregulated businesses esi looks to grow its electric and natural gas business  targeting growth in the northeastern united states and adjacent portions of canada through strategic acquisitions  market penetration of existing businesses  and new product offerings  which is where esi has the most market expertise 
as discussed above  our utilities are our core businesses and as such we are placing a strong emphasis on growth of utility operations in order to balance our regulated and nonregulated growth 
pdi focuses on optimizing the operational efficiency of its existing portfolio of assets and pursues compatible power development projects and the acquisition of generation assets that fit in well with esi s customer base and market expertise 
in july  esi completed the acquisition of advantage energy  a privately held nonregulated electric power marketer based in buffalo  new york 
this acquisition provides esi with enhanced opportunities to participate in the new york market  where we believe there is good opportunity for further penetration and the sale of new products 
esi continues to grow its business in the energy management sector by providing customers the expertise needed to manage their energy needs in volatile energy markets 
place strong emphasis on asset management our asset management strategy calls for the continuing disposition and acquisition of assets in a manner that enhances our earnings capability 
the acquisition portion of this strategy calls for the acquisition of assets that compliment our existing assets and strategy such as advantage energy 
another portion of the asset management strategy calls for the disposition of assets  including plants and entire business units  which are no longer required for operations 
we continue to pursue the sale of sunbury and expect to have a completed sale in the sale of sunbury fits well within our asset management strategy 
included in this strategy is the desire to reduce risk associated with uncontracted merchant exposure 
we continue to pursue the sale of kewaunee to a subsidiary of dominion resources 
our peshtigo river land sale initiative which included land sales and donations to the wdnr and the sale of land at public auction was completed in we continue to identify alternatives for the sale of the balance of our identified excess real estate holdings 
regulated utilities our regulated utilities include wpsc and uppco 
wpsc derives its revenues primarily from the production  distribution  and sale of electricity  and the purchase  distribution  and sale of natural gas to retail customers in a service area of approximately  square miles in northeastern wisconsin and an adjacent portion of the upper peninsula of michigan 
the pscw and the mpsc regulate these retail sales 
wpsc also provides wholesale electric service to numerous utilities and cooperatives for resale 
ferc regulates wholesale sales 
uppco derives revenues from the sale of electric energy in a service area of approximately  square miles in the upper peninsula of michigan and is regulated by the mpsc 
the regulatory commissions allow the utilities to earn a return on common stock equity that is commensurate with an investor s desired return  compensating for the risks investors face when providing funds to the utility 
the return on common stock equity approved by the pscw  ferc  and the mpsc was   and  respectively  in generally  consumers bear the price risk for fuel and purchased power costs as regulators allow the utility to recover substantially all of these costs to the extent they are prudently incurred  through various cost recovery mechanisms  but utilities bear volume risk as rates are based upon normal sales volumes as projected by the utility 
the utilities may also be able to defer certain unexpected costs that are incurred during the year for recovery in future rate proceedings examples include wpsc s deferral of costs associated with the extended kewaunee outage in and deferral of costs incurred by uppco related to the dead river flood  however  these costs must be prudently incurred as determined by the regulatory commissions 
as such  the ability of our regulated utilities to earn their approved return on equity is dependent upon accurate forecasting techniques  their ability to obtain timely rate increases to account for rising cost structures while minimizing the required rate increases in order to maintain the competitiveness of our core industrial customer base and keep these customers in our service area  and certain conditions that are outside of their control  such as macroeconomic factors and weather conditions 
unfavorable weather conditions compared to normal for both electric and natural gas utility operations and increased operating expenses contributed to wpsc s inability to earn its approved rate of return in uncertainties related to the deregulation process are a risk for our regulated utilities 
deregulation of natural gas service has begun in wisconsin 
currently  the largest natural gas customers can purchase natural gas from suppliers other than their local utility 
efforts are underway to make it easier for smaller natural gas customers to do the same 
we believe electric deregulation inside wisconsin is at least several years off as the state is focused on improving reliability by building more generation and transmission facilities and creating fair market rules 
if electric choice occurs  we believe we could lose some generation load but would retain the delivery revenues and margin 
also  the capacity that would be freed up should be competitive in our marketplace 
deregulation of electricity is present in michigan  however  in the upper peninsula of michigan  no customers have chosen an alternative electric supplier and no alternative electric suppliers have offered to serve any customers in michigan s upper peninsula due to the lack of excess transmission and generation system capacity in the areas we serve  which is a barrier to competitive suppliers entering the market 
the utilities are also exposed to costs associated with increasingly stringent environmental rules and regulations to the extent recovery of these costs is disallowed in rate proceedings 
wpsc and uppco are also members of the midwest independent system operator  which is in the process of restructuring the electric market in its footprint

wps energy services esi offers nonregulated natural gas  electric  and alternate fuel supplies  as well as energy management and consulting services  to retail and wholesale customers primarily in the northeastern quadrant of the united states and adjacent portions of canada 
although esi has a widening array of products and services  revenues are primarily derived through sales of electricity and natural gas to retail and wholesale customers 
esi s marketing and trading operations manage power and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments 
esi strives to maintain a low risk portfolio with relatively few open positions  balancing natural gas and electricity purchase commitments with corresponding sales commitments 
in  esi purchased electricity required to fulfill these sales commitments primarily from independent generators  energy marketers  and organized electric power markets and purchased natural gas from a variety of producers and suppliers under daily  monthly  seasonal  and long term contracts  with pricing delivery and volume schedules to accommodate customer requirements 
esi s customers include utilities  municipalities  cooperatives  commercial and industrial consumers  aggregators  and other marketing and retail entities 
esi uses derivative financial instruments to provide flexible pricing to customers and suppliers  manage purchase and sales commitments  and reduce exposure relative to volatile market prices 
the table below discloses future natural gas and electric sales volumes under contract as of december  contracts are generally one to three years in duration 
esi expects that its ultimate sales volumes in and beyond will exceed the volumes shown in the table below as it continues to seek growth opportunities and existing customers who do not have long term contracts continue to buy their short term requirements from esi 
forward contracted volumes at to to wholesale sales volumes billion cubic feet retail sales volumes billion cubic feet total natural gas sales volumes wholesale sales volumes million kilowatt hours retail sales volumes million kilowatt hours total electric sales volumes these tables represent physical sales contracts for natural gas and electric power for delivery or settlement in future periods 
management has no reason to believe that gross margins that will be generated by these contracts will vary significantly from those experienced historically 
for comparative purposes  future natural gas and electric sales volumes under contract at december  are shown below 
actual electric and natural gas sales volumes for are disclosed within results of operations wps resources  esi segment operations 
forward contracted volumes at to to wholesale sales volumes billion cubic feet retail sales volumes billion cubic feet total natural gas sales volumes wholesale sales volumes million kilowatt hours retail sales volumes million kilowatt hours total electric sales volumes these tables represent physical sales contracts for natural gas and electric power for delivery or settlement in future periods 
management has no reason to believe that gross margins that will be generated by these contracts will vary significantly from those experienced historically 
esi has experienced steady increases in electric and natural gas sales volumes since its inception  and expects this trend to continue as it continues to look for opportunities that fit within its growth strategy 
in  esi grew its retail electric business through the acquisition of retail operations in new york and through portfolio optimization strategies utilized to maximize the value of pdi s merchant generation fleet and esi s retail supply portfolio 
natural gas volumes increased as a result of the continued expansion of esi s retail natural gas business in canada 
esi expects to continue to target acquisitions and participate in generation service programs within the area it serves 
as a company that participates in energy commodity markets  esi is exposed to a variety of risks  including market  operational  liquidity  and credit risks 
market risk is measured as the potential gain or loss of a portfolio that is associated with a price movement within a given probability over a specific period of time  known as value at risk 
through the use of derivative financial instruments  we believe we have reduced our value at risk to acceptable levels see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for more information about value at risk 
operational risk is the risk of loss from less than flawless execution of transactions  forecasting  scheduling  or other operational activities and is common to all companies participating in the energy marketing industry 
esi s continued investment in computational infrastructure  business process improvement  employee training  and internal controls has helped mitigate operational risk to date 
liquidity risk is an emerging risk and one that has historically been less applicable to esi than many industry participants because of the financial support provided by wps resources in the form of guarantees to counterparties 
a significant downgrade in wps resources credit ratings  however  could cause counterparties to demand additional assurances of payment 
wps resources board of directors imposes restrictions on the amount of guarantees wps resources is allowed to provide to these counterparties in order to protect its credit ratings  and esi believes it would have adequate capital to continue core operations unless wps resources credit ratings fell below investment grade standard poor s rating of bbb and moody s rating of baa 
the other category of risk mentioned above that esi faces is credit risk from retail and wholesale counterparties 
in order to mitigate its exposure to credit risk  esi has implemented stringent credit policies 
as a result of these credit policies  esi has not experienced significant write offs from its large wholesale counterparties to date 
write offs pertaining to retail counterparties were million  or  in  compared to million  or  in esi believes its write off percentage is within the range experienced by most energy companies 
the table below summarizes wholesale counterparty credit exposure  categorized by maturity date  as of december  in millions counterparty rating millions exposure exposure less than year exposure to years net exposure of counterparties greater than of net exposure investment grade regulated utility investment grade other non investment grade regulated utility non investment grade other non rated regulated utility non rated other total exposure the investment and non investment grade categories are determined by publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty or the rating of any guarantor  whichever is higher 
investment grade counterparties are those with a senior unsecured moody s rating of baa or above or a standard poor s rating of bbb or above 
exposure considers netting of accounts receivable and accounts payable where netting agreements are in place as well as netting mark to market exposure 
exposure is before consideration of collateral from counterparties 
collateral  in the form of cash and letters of credit  received from counterparties totaled million at december   million from non investment grade counterparties and million from non rated counterparties 
a risk that became more prevalent in is industry restructuring 
there is some concern over the status of the nonregulated energy market in michigan and ohio  which are two states in which esi operates 
esi is also a member of the midwest independent system operator  which is in the process of restructuring the electric power market in its footprint 
for more information on these risks  see trends wps resources 
wps power development pdi competes in the wholesale merchant electric power generation industry  primarily in the midwest and northeastern united states and adjacent portions of canada 
pdi s core competencies include power plant operation and maintenance and material condition assessment of assets 
in order to enable pdi to focus on its core competencies and improve the efficiency and reliability of its existing fleet of power plants  esi has assumed much of the market price risk associated with these plants 
through several tolling agreements and power purchase agreements  esi has contracted for approximately of pdi s megawatts of total capacity these capacity numbers exclude sunbury  which is recorded in discontinued operations 
esi utilizes power from pdi s new england and canadian assets primarily to serve its firm load commitments in northern maine and certain other sale agreements with customers 
for the remaining capacity contracted from pdi  esi utilizes financial tools  including forwards  options  and swaps to limit exposure  as well as to extract additional value from pdi s merchant generation fleet 
these activities had a positive impact on esi s margin in and benefited pdi by providing more stable revenue streams 
pdi has power purchase agreements in place with third party customers for the megawatts of capacity that is not contracted to esi  which includes its stoneman facility in cassville  wisconsin  and its combined locks facility in combined locks  wisconsin 
oversupply of capacity  low spark spreads spark spread is the difference between the market price of electricity and its cost of production  and high fuel costs have led to lower than anticipated results for pdi s merchant generation business in recent years 
in response to these market conditions  pdi has taken steps to adjust to the current wholesale merchant environment 
as discussed above  beginning in january  esi began assuming much of the market price risk for pdi s merchant generation fleet 
prior to the capacity and power contracts with esi  risk management activities ie  hedging activities were sparsely utilized  leaving pdi s generation fleet more exposed to market price risk 
pdi also continues to pursue the sale of sunbury and anticipates that the plant will be sold in the sunbury sale will allow pdi to reduce its uncontracted merchant exposure and enable wps resources to redeploy capital into business opportunities with different risk profiles 
pdi  through its subsidiary eco coal pelletization llc  also owns an interest in a synthetic fuel producing facility 
see trends wps resources  synthetic fuel operation for more information on the risks related to pdi s investment in this synthetic fuel operation 
pdi is subject to clean air regulations enforced by the epa and state and local governments 
new legislation could require significant capital outlays 
see note to wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pdi s environmental exposure 
results of operations wps resources compared with wps resources overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following table wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share the million increase in consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  was largely driven by a million  or  increase in revenue at esi and an million  or  increase in electric utility revenue 
higher natural gas prices  portfolio optimization strategies implemented in  and expansion of the canadian retail natural gas business were the primary contributors to increased revenue at esi 
higher electric utility revenue was primarily the result of authorized retail electric rate increases for wpsc s wisconsin and michigan customers 
revenue changes by reportable segment are discussed in more detail below 
income available for common shareholders was million basic earnings per share for the year ended december   compared to million basic earnings per share for the year ended december  significant factors impacting the change in earnings and earnings per share are as follows and are discussed in more detail below 
approved rate increases including the impact of timely retail electric rate relief in  compared to the delay in receiving retail electric rate relief in favorably impacted year over year margin at the utilities 
natural gas utility throughput volumes were lower in due to weather that was warmer during the heating season  compared to higher throughput volumes and improved supply management in ohio favorably impacted esi s year over year retail natural gas margin 
portfolio optimization strategies  better management of retail operations in ohio and positive operating results from advantage energy contributed to improved year over year electric margins at esi 
as part of our overall asset management strategy  wps resources realized earnings of million from the sale and donation of land in  compared to million in earnings from equity method investments primarily from atc increased in  compared to earnings were negatively impacted by higher operating and maintenance expenses in synthetic fuel related tax credits recognized were higher in when compared to the weighted average number of shares of wps resources common stock increased by million shares for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the increase was largely due to issuing  additional shares of common stock through a public offering in november additional shares were also issued under the stock investment plan and certain stock based employee benefit plans 
overview of utility operations utility operations include the electric utility segment  consisting of the electric operations of wpsc and uppco and the gas utility segment comprising the natural gas operations at wpsc 
income available for common shareholders attributable to the electric utility segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  income available for common shareholders attributable to the gas utility segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  electric utility segment operations wps resources electric utility segment results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility revenue increased largely due to authorized retail and wholesale electric rate increases for wpsc s wisconsin and michigan customers as summarized below to recover higher fuel and purchased power costs  increased operating expenses  and expenditures incurred for infrastructure improvements 
effective march   the pscw approved a retail electric rate increase of million  or 
effective may   ferc approved a million  or  interim increase in wholesale electric rates 
effective july   the mpsc approved a million  or  increase in retail electric rates for wpsc s michigan customers and authorized recovery of million of increased transmission costs through the power supply cost recovery process 
effective january   the pscw approved a retail electric rate increase of million  or 
electric utility sales volumes were also slightly higher in  increasing over sales volumes 
a increase in sales volumes to commercial and industrial customers was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes to residential customers 
higher sales volumes to our commercial and industrial customers reflect an improving economy and growth within our service area  while the decrease in sales volumes to residential customers reflects weather that was cooler during the cooling season  compared to the electric utility margin increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the majority of this increase can be attributed to a million  or  increase in wpsc s electric margin 
the increase in wpsc s electric margin is primarily related to the retail and wholesale electric rate increases  partially offset by a million increase in purchased power costs 
the quantity of power purchased in increased over purchases  and purchased power costs were higher on a per unit basis in  compared to the pscw allows wpsc to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs are in excess of plus or minus from approved levels 
in response to a request for additional fuel cost recovery filed early in  wpsc was allowed to recover million of its increased fuel and purchased power costs during the pscw also allowed wpsc to defer million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs directly associated with the extension of the kewaunee refueling outage in the fourth quarter of the kewaunee outage was extended three weeks due primarily to an unexpected problem encountered with equipment used for lifting internal vessel components to perform a required ten year in service inspection 
it is anticipated that these costs will be recovered in  pending final approval 
electric utility earnings increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the increased earnings were largely driven by the higher margin at wpsc including the effect of timely retail electric rate relief in compared to a delay in receiving retail electric rate relief in  partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses 
gas utility segment operations wps resources gas utility segment results millions change revenues purchased gas costs margins throughput in therms gas utility revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to higher revenue was driven by an authorized rate increase and an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas  partially offset by an overall decrease in natural gas throughput volumes 
the pscw issued a final order authorizing a retail natural gas rate increase of million  or  effective january  natural gas prices increased per unit in higher natural gas prices reflect higher marketplace natural gas costs in the pscw and the mpsc allow wpsc to pass changes in the total cost of natural gas on to customers 
as a result  changes in the price of the natural gas commodity do not have a direct impact on wpsc s margin 
the decrease in natural gas throughput volumes was driven by weather that was warmer during the heating season for the year ended december   compared to the natural gas utility margin increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the higher natural gas utility margin is largely due to the authorized rate increase mentioned above 
the ability of wpsc to realize the full benefit of an authorized rate increase is dependent upon normal throughput volumes  therefore  the decrease in natural gas throughput volumes negatively impacted wpsc s ability to benefit from the full amount of the rate increase 
the higher margin drove a million  or increase in natural gas utility earnings for the year ended december  overview of nonregulated operations nonregulated operations consist of natural gas  electric  and other sales at esi  a diversified energy supply and services company  and the operations of pdi  an electric generation company 
esi and pdi are both reportable segments 
income available for common shareholders attributable to esi was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in higher overall margins were offset by an increase in operating expenses and a million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principles that was recorded at esi in pdi reported income available for common shareholders of million for the year ended december   compared to a million net loss for the year ended december   largely due to an increase in the amount of tax credits recognized and a lower loss from discontinued operations  partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses and a lower overall margin 
esi s segment operations total segment revenues at esi were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december  the total margin at esi was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  esi s nonregulated natural gas and electric operations are the primary contributors to revenues and margins and are discussed below 
esi s natural gas results millions except sales volumes change nonregulated natural gas revenues nonregulated natural gas cost of sales margins wholesale sales volumes in billion cubic feet retail sales volumes in billion cubic feet represents gross physical volumes natural gas revenue increased million  driven by higher natural gas prices and the expansion of the canadian retail natural gas business due to obtaining new customers  partially offset by lower sales volumes from physical wholesale transactions 
sales volumes from physical wholesale transactions declined as a result of reduced price volatility of natural gas during the first half of volatility provides more opportunity for profitable physical wholesale transactions 
the natural gas margin at esi increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the margin related to retail natural gas operations increased million  primarily driven by higher natural gas throughput volumes in ohio driven by the addition of new customers  operational improvements  and better management of supply for residential and small commercial customers 
customer growth in canada also contributed to the increase in the retail natural gas margin 
the margin attributed to wholesale natural gas operations increased million 
the increase in wholesale natural gas margin was driven by a million margin increase related to the natural gas storage cycle  a million increase in the canadian wholesale natural gas margin  and increased margins from other structured wholesale natural gas transactions 
favorable settlements of liabilities with several counterparties in in the amount of million largely offset these increases in the wholesale natural gas margin 
for the year ended december   the natural gas storage cycle had a million positive impact on margin  compared with a million negative impact on margin for the same period in the increase in the canadian wholesale natural gas margin is related to higher volumes more structured wholesale transactions as esi continues to increase its wholesale natural gas operations in this region 
esi experiences earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle  which runs annually from april through march of the next year 
generally  injections of natural gas into storage inventory take place in the summer months and natural gas is withdrawn from storage in the winter months 
esi s policy is to hedge the value of natural gas storage with sales in the over the counter and futures markets  effectively locking in a margin on the natural gas in storage 
however  fair market value hedge accounting rules require the natural gas in storage to be marked to market using spot prices  while the future sales contracts are marked to market using forward prices 
when the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price of natural gas  esi experiences volatility in its earnings 
consequently  earnings volatility may occur within the contract period for natural gas in storage 
the accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions 
at december   there was a million difference between the market value of natural gas in storage and the market value of future sales contracts net risk management liability  related to the natural gas storage cycle 
at december   there was a million difference net risk management liability related to the natural gas storage cycle 
the difference between the market value of natural gas in storage and the market value of future sales contracts related to the storage cycle is expected to vary with market conditions  but will reverse entirely when all of the natural gas is withdrawn from storage 
esi s electric results millions change nonregulated electric revenues nonregulated electric cost of sales margins wholesale sales volumes in kilowatt hours retail sales volumes in kilowatt hours represents gross physical volumes electric revenue increased million  largely due to an million increase resulting from higher volumes from portfolio optimization strategies 
in the first quarter of  esi first implemented the portfolio optimization strategies to optimize the value of pdi s merchant generation fleet and its own retail supply portfolios to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from these assets through the use of various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts and options 
electric revenue also increased as a result of the july   acquisition of advantage energy and higher energy prices compared to the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes from participation in the new jersey basic generation services program  as esi s participation in this program ended in may esi s electric margin increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the retail electric margin increased million compared to the margin related to retail electric operations in ohio increased million  which can be attributed to better management of retail operations and improved supply procurement 
also contributing to the increase in retail electric margin was a million favorable settlement of a counterparty pricing dispute and positive operating results from advantage energy 
the increase in the retail electric margin was partially offset by a decrease in margin from retail electric operations in maine 
the lower margin in maine was anticipated due to the sales price and supply cost associated with the new provider of last resort in northern maine which became effective in march 
the margin from retail electric operations in michigan also decreased  driven by higher wholesale electricity prices  higher transmission related charges  and an increase in competition 
the margin attributed to wholesale electric operations increased million 
the higher wholesale electric margin was driven by a million increase from the portfolio optimization strategies discussed above 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in margin from esi s participation in the new jersey basic generation services program  which began in august and ended in may under the program  esi realized greater margins in  compared to pdi s segment operations all revenues and costs of pdi s discontinued operations sunbury are combined and reported on a net basis in wps resources consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
accordingly  the table below does not include revenues and cost of sales of discontinued operations  which are discussed separately within discontinued operations below 
pdi s production results millions change nonregulated other revenues nonregulated other cost of sales margins pdi s revenue decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to  largely due to reduced generation from its beaver falls facility in new york  lower revenue from its combined locks energy center in wisconsin  lower revenue from its steam boiler in oregon  and lower revenue from its wyman generation facility in maine 
the beaver falls facility experienced an unplanned plant outage that began in october  with the facility returning to service in april this facility continued to experience lower volumes after returning to service as pdi has been more conservative in the dispatch of this unit to preserve the limited remaining service life of the turbine blades for higher margin opportunities 
the decrease in revenue at the combined locks energy center was driven by lower demand for energy by the counterparty to a power purchase agreement in place at this facility and an unplanned plant outage that began in march  and continued through may the decrease in revenue from the steam boiler in oregon was largely due to a day planned outage to perform repairs on the boiler  which took place in the second quarter of a power purchase agreement in place at the wyman facility in was not renewed in as a result  energy from the wyman facility was sold into short term power markets in  but unfavorable energy prices and lack of demand for capacity resulted in a decline in the amount of power generated at this facility in  compared to the decline in revenue was partially offset by higher sales volumes at the stoneman generation facility in cassville  wisconsin  related to a new power purchase agreement in place at this facility 
pdi s margin for the year ended december   decreased million  or  compared to this margin does not include the results of pdi s discontinued operations  which are reported separately in the consolidated statements of income discontinued operations are discussed below 
the niagara  beaver falls  and wyman generating facilities experienced a combined million decrease in margin 
the lower margin at the niagara generating facility was largely due to an increase in the per ton cost of coal utilized in the generation process 
the unplanned plant outage experienced at the beaver falls facility and lower volumes related to pdi s decision to only dispatch the facility at times when energy prices are at a very favorable level  drove the decrease in margin at this facility 
unfavorable energy prices and lack of demand for capacity negatively impacted sales volumes at the wyman generation facility there was a power purchase agreement in place at this facility in 
these decreases were partially offset by a combined million increase in margins at the combined locks energy center and the stoneman generation facility 
the higher margin at the combined locks energy center was driven by a negotiated increase in the dispatch flexibility of steam sold under a supply agreement with a counterparty  resulting in an increase in the value of electricity produced from this facility 
the increase in margin at the stoneman generation facility was due to higher sales volumes 
overview of holding company and other segment operations holding company and other operations include the operations of wps resources and wps resources capital as holding companies and the nonutility activities at wpsc and uppco 
holding company and other operations had income available for common shareholders of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  this favorable variance can be attributed to an increase in earnings recognized from the sale of wisconsin land located along the peshtigo river and an increase in equity earnings from atc and wisconsin river power company 
equity earnings from atc were million in  compared to million in wpsc nonutility operations recognized a million pre tax gain on the sale of land located near the peshtigo river in the fourth quarter of  compared to a million pre tax gain that was recognized on the sale of land in the fourth quarter of wpsc also realized an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of from the donation of land to the wdnr 
operating expenses wps resources operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense taxes other than income operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to utility operating and maintenance expenses increased million 
electric transmission and distribution costs were up million at the utilities due primarily to an increase in transmission rates 
pension and postretirement medical costs incurred at the utilities increased million 
additionally  million of the increase was driven by amortization of costs incurred in conjunction with the implementation of the automated meter reading system and the purchase of the de pere energy center previously deferred as regulatory assets 
maintenance expenses at wpsc s coal fired generation facilities were million higher in  compared to  driven by an extension of the annual planned outage at the pulliam generation facility in higher payroll and other benefit costs also contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
the fall refueling outage at kewaunee did not significantly impact the year over year change in operating and maintenance expenses as there was also a refueling outage at kewaunee in spring  and the pscw approved the deferral of incremental operating and maintenance expenses that were incurred as a direct result of the refueling outage extension million of operating and maintenance expenses were deferred in the fourth quarter of and collection is anticipated in 
operating expenses at esi increased million mostly due to higher payroll  benefits  and other costs associated with continued business expansion 
operating and maintenance expenses at pdi were million higher as a result of repairs and maintenance expenses incurred in conjunction with outages at its beaver falls generation facility  the combined locks energy center  and the westwood generation station 
depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to  due primarily to a decrease of million resulting from lower realized gains on decommissioning trust assets and because the decommissioning trust was not funded in in anticipation of selling kewaunee 
realized gains on decommissioning trust assets are substantially offset by depreciation expense pursuant to regulatory practice see detailed discussion in miscellaneous income below 
an increase in depreciation expense from plant asset additions at wpsc partially offset the decrease in decommissioning expense 
other income expense wps resources other income expense millions change miscellaneous income interest expense and distributions of preferred securities minority interest other income expense miscellaneous income miscellaneous income decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the decrease in miscellaneous income is largely due to a decrease in realized gains on decommissioning trust assets of million 
there were significant realized gains recognized on decommissioning trust assets in the fourth quarter of  which were driven by a change in the investment strategy for wpsc s qualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
qualified decommissioning trust assets were placed in more conservative investments in anticipation of the sale of kewaunee 
pursuant to regulatory practice  realized gains on decommissioning trust assets are substantially offset by depreciation expense 
a million write off of previously deferred financing costs associated with the redemption of our trust preferred securities in the first quarter of also unfavorably impacted miscellaneous income 
partially offsetting the decreases discussed above were an million increase in equity earnings from investments  a million increase in income recognized from the sale of wisconsin land located along the peshtigo river discussed previously  and a combined million increase related to higher royalties and a decrease in operating losses realized from our investment in a synthetic fuel producing facility 
the increase in equity earnings was primarily related to our investments in atc  wisconsin river power company  and wisconsin valley improvement company 
equity earnings from atc were million in  compared to million in royalty income recognized from the synthetic fuel facility increased as a result of higher production levels at this facility 
minority interest the decrease in minority interest is related to the fact that pdi s partner in its subsidiary  eco coal pellitization llc  was allocated more production from the synthetic fuel operation in compared to pdi s partner was not allocated any production from the synthetic fuel facility in the first quarter of as they requested additional production in the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by tax deductions pertaining to items that exceed the related book expense including land donated to the wdnr in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a million decrease in the provision for income taxes compared to  a million increase in the amount of tax credits recognized in related to an increase in synthetic fuel tax credits produced in and the favorable settlement of several federal tax audits and refund claims related to prior tax years 
our ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation resulted in the recognition of million of section federal tax credits for the year ended december   and million of tax credits for the increase in synthetic fuel related tax credits was primarily due to an increase in tax credits produced and allocable to pdi  an increase in the value of the credits produced resulting from the higher btu content of coal and the annual inflation adjustment allowed  and the favorable settlement of several tax audits and refund claims related to prior tax years 
discontinued operations the after tax loss from discontinued operations sunbury was million for the year ended december   compared to million in the decrease in the loss from discontinued operations was driven by a million termination payment that was received from duquesne power in december as a result of duquesne s termination of the asset sale agreement for sunbury  a million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses  and a million reduction in interest expense 
the decrease in operating and maintenance expenses was driven by lower depreciation expense resulting from the discontinuance of depreciation on those assets classified as held for sale effective december in addition  repair and maintenance expenses were higher in because of mechanical difficulties related to fuel delivery systems 
sunbury s margin decreased in  compared to  partially offsetting the favorable variances discussed above 
the margin was negatively impacted by an increase in the per ton cost of coal utilized to service a fixed price outtake contract and a decrease in opportunities to sell power into the spot market 
in anticipation of the sale  sunbury did not enter into staggered term coal contracts in accordance with its normal procurement practice 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principles on january   wps resources recorded a positive after tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million primarily related to the operations of esi to income available for common shareholders as a net result of removing from its balance sheet the mark to market effects of contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative 
this change in accounting resulted from the decision of the emerging issues task force to preclude mark to market accounting for energy contracts that are not derivatives 
the required change in accounting had no impact on the underlying economics or cash flows of the contracts 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  at pdi resulted in a million negative after tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of  related to recording a liability for the closure of an ash basin at sunbury 
compared with wps resources overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following table wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share total revenues increased significantly due to the required reclassification of previously reported revenues and cost of sales see esi s segment operations below for further information 
total revenues also increased due to sales volume growth at esi  electric utility rate increases  and higher natural gas prices 
income available for common shareholders was million basic earnings per share for the year ended december   compared to million basic earnings per share for the year ended december  significant factors impacting the change in earnings and earnings per share are as follows and are discussed in more detail below approved rate increases and a change in electric utility sales mix favorably impacted margins at the utilities 
cooler weather during the cooling season in negatively impacted electric utility margins 
colder weather during the heating season in positively impacted natural gas throughput volumes 
rising operating expenses primarily pension and medical costs  together with a delay in receiving retail electric rate relief  negatively impacted electric utility earnings 
esi s november acquisition of a retail natural gas business in canada and favorable settlements with several counterparties drove an increased year over year retail natural gas margin 
esi s electric margin improved as a result of acquisition synergies  improved management of retail operations in michigan  and participation in the new jersey basic generation service program 
pdi s earnings were significantly lower in  primarily as a result of an million decrease in after tax gains recognized from sales of portions of its interest in a synthetic fuel operation  a million increased loss from discontinued operations  and a million reduction in tax credits recognized from the synthetic fuel operation 
consolidated operating expenses increased in also impacting basic earnings per share was an increase of million in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of wps resources common stock in compared to the increase was largely due to issuing  additional shares through a public offering in november additional shares were also issued in under the stock investment plan 
overview of utility operations income available for common shareholders attributable to the electric utility segment was million in compared to million in income available for common shareholders attributable to the gas utility segment was million in compared to million in electric utility segment operations wps resources electric utility segment results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility segment revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was largely due to retail and wholesale electric rate increases for our wisconsin and michigan customers in accordance with new rate orders 
the electric utility margin increased million  or  in compared to due primarily to the electric rate increases  electric margins at wpsc increased million  or 
electric margins at wpsc were also impacted favorably by a change in sales mix in while total sales volumes remained basically unchanged in compared to  sales volumes to higher margin residential  and commercial and industrial customers increased slightly 
the increase in sales volumes to these higher margin customer classes reflects growth within wpsc s service area and changes in the economy 
these increases were partially offset by cooler weather during the cooling season for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  electric margins at uppco increased million  or  due primarily to retail electric rate increases  partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes 
the decrease in sales volumes was attributed to less favorable weather conditions for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and customer conservation of electricity made necessary due to a flood that occurred earlier in although the electric utility margin increased  electric utility segment earnings for the year ended december   decreased million compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease in electric utility segment earnings was due to a decrease in earnings at wpsc attributed to a delay in receiving retail electric rate relief  together with rising operating expenses primarily pension and medical costs 
rate relief for our increasing operating costs was expected on january   however  the increase in retail electric rates granted by the pscw was not effective until march  the delay in receiving rate relief was a significant factor in our inability to achieve our authorized return on equity in the decrease in earnings experienced by wpsc was partially offset by a modest increase in earnings at uppco due to the increase in rates 
gas utility segment operations wps resources gas utility segment results millions change revenues purchased gas costs margins throughput in therms gas utility segment revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in gas utility revenues is mostly due to a increase in the average cost of natural gas for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  partially offset by the decrease in retail natural gas rates ordered by the pscw  effective march  the natural gas utility margin for the year ended december   increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase in the natural gas utility margin can be attributed to a increase in natural gas throughput volumes in compared to natural gas throughput volumes to our higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers increased in the aggregate  mostly as a result of colder weather in compared to natural gas throughput volumes to our lower margin transport customers decreased due to the rising price of natural gas together with their ability to use alternate fuel sources 
despite the modest increase in gas utility margins  gas utility earnings for the year ended december   decreased million compared to the decline is primarily due to rising operating expenses primarily pension and medical costs together with the decrease in natural gas rates mentioned above 
overview of nonregulated operations esi s income available for common shareholders increased to million in compared with million in  primarily as a result of increased electric and natural gas margins discussed below 
pdi recognized a net loss of million in compared to income available for common shareholders of million in despite an increase in margins  pdi s earnings were impacted by a decrease in gains recognized from the sale of portions of its interest in a synthetic fuel operation  increased losses from discontinued operations  and a decrease in the amount of tax credits recognized 
esi s segment operations total segment revenues at esi were  million in compared to million in the total margin at esi was million in compared to million in esi s nonregulated natural gas and electric operations are the primary contributors to revenues and margins and are discussed below 
esi s natural gas results millions except sales volumes change nonregulated natural gas revenues nonregulated natural gas cost of sales margins wholesale sales volumes in billion cubic feet retail sales volumes in billion cubic feet represents gross physical volumes esi s nonregulated natural gas revenues increased  million for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
approximately million of the increase related to the required adoption of issue no 
 effective january  see trends wps resources for more information about this accounting change 
volume growth driven by the acquisition of a retail natural gas business in canada accounted for approximately million of the increase in revenues in most of the remaining increase was attributed to higher natural gas prices compared to the prior year 
natural gas margins at esi increased million  or  in compared to approximately million of the increase related to the november   acquisition of a retail natural gas business in canada 
the remaining increase related to favorable settlements of pending liabilities with several counterparties  partially offset by the change in accounting prescribed by the required adoption of issue see cumulative effect of change in accounting principles below for further discussion 
esi s electric results millions change nonregulated electric revenues nonregulated electric cost of sales margins wholesale sales volumes in kilowatt hours retail sales volumes in kilowatt hours represents gross physical volumes esi s nonregulated electric revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
approximately million of the increase related to the required adoption of issue another million of the increase was attributed to participation in the new jersey basic generation services program 
esi acquired megawatts of fixed price load and megawatts of variable priced load for the period from august   to may   as a result of its participation in this program 
the remaining increase in nonregulated electric revenues was attributed to increased prices and expansion within existing service territories 
esi also acquired retail electric operations in michigan in prior to the acquisition  this operation was an electric wholesale customer of esi  therefore  the acquisition did not have a significant impact on total revenues in compared to the acquisition did  however  account for most of the increase in retail sales volumes and related decrease in wholesale sales volumes in compared to esi s electric margin increased million  or  in compared to approximately million of the increase was due to acquisition synergies and improved management of retail operations in michigan and participation in the new jersey basic generation service program 
the remaining increase in esi s electric margins was largely due to the impact of the change in accounting prescribed by the required adoption of issue  which precluded mark to market accounting for nonderivative trading contracts 
pdi s segment operations all revenues and costs of pdi s discontinued operations are combined and reported on a net basis in wps resources consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
accordingly  the table below does not include the results of discontinued operations  which are discussed separately within discontinued operations below 
pdi s production results millions change nonregulated other revenues nonregulated other cost of sales margins pdi s revenues increased million  or  in compared to pdi s margin increased million  or  in compared to the increase in revenues and margin was primarily the result of increased generation from generating assets acquired in new york on june   revenues from the combined locks energy center that became fully operational in the second quarter of  and an increase in generation at the hydroelectric plants in maine and canada as a result of increased rainfall  higher capacity revenues  and increased pricing on a renegotiated outtake contract 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenues and margins at pdi s stoneman generating facility in cassville  wisconsin  as a result of the expiration of an energy and capacity outtake contract that was not renewed 
overview of holding company and other segment operations holding company and other operations experienced a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the decrease in the net loss experienced was largely related to an increase in gains recognized on hydroelectric land sales in compared to recorded as a component of miscellaneous income  primarily due to a million pre tax gain recognized in from land sales to the wdnr 
the sale of these hydroelectric lands was part of our asset management strategy  which was initiated in  and was intended to optimize shareholder return from the sale  development  or use of certain assets or entire business units 
operating expenses wps resources operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense taxes other than income operating and maintenance expense operating expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  utility operating expenses increased million  or  in compared to approximately million of the increase reflects higher pension  postretirement medical  and active medical costs 
the remaining increase pertains to costs incurred for plant maintenance related to kewaunee s scheduled refueling outage in there was no refueling outage in  additional operating expenses at kewaunee  and wage increases 
operating expenses at esi increased million  or  in compared to  largely due to costs associated with business expansion  including the acquisition of a retail natural gas business in canada and a retail electric business in michigan 
the remaining increase was largely due to higher incentive compensation costs and the costs associated with a full year of operation of generation assets in new york that were purchased by pdi in june depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million  or  due primarily to an increase of million from increased realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets that resulted in recording decommissioning expense approximately equal to the gains recognized in miscellaneous income pursuant to regulatory practice 
the increase in realized gains was due primarily to the change in investment strategy for wpsc s qualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
qualified decommissioning trust assets were transferred to more conservative investments in pending the sale of kewaunee  thus triggering realized gains 
most of the remaining increase resulted from plant asset additions at wpsc and pdi 
taxes other than income taxes other than income increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in gross receipts taxes paid by wpsc as a result of increased revenues 
other income expense wps resources other income expense millions change miscellaneous income interest expense and distributions of preferred securities minority interest other income expense miscellaneous income miscellaneous income increased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in miscellaneous income was largely due to an increase in realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets of million  which was primarily the result of the change in investment strategy for the qualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
the realized gains were offset by increased decommissioning expense  as discussed above 
miscellaneous income also increased million as a result of the sale of land to the wdnr and million resulting from an increase in earnings from equity investments 
the increases in miscellaneous income were partially offset by lower gains from sales of ownership interests in pdi s synthetic fuel operation 
pdi recognized a million pre tax gain in compared with a million pre tax gain in related to these sales 
an increase in operating losses generated by the synthetic fuel operation due to increased production decreased miscellaneous income by approximately million in the increased operating losses were driven by our partner s ability to utilize tax credits in and were offset by minority interest  which is discussed below 
in the aggregate  the items mentioned above relating to the synthetic fuel operation resulted in a million decrease in miscellaneous income 
the gain resulted from the sale of a portion of pdi s interest in its synthetic fuel operation 
similar gains from the sale are expected to be recognized annually through  dependent upon production at the synthetic fuel facility 
the gain reported in resulted from a sale of a portion of pdi s interest in a synthetic fuel operation  which was recognized in its entirety by december  minority interest as a result of pdi s sale of an approximate interest in its subsidiary  eco coal pelletization llc  on december   million of losses related to the synthetic fuel operation and reported in miscellaneous income were allocated to pdi s partner and reported as a minority interest 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate in compared to was largely due to a decrease in tax credits that could be recognized from our ownership interest in a synthetic fuel operation 
tax credits recognized during the year ended december   decreased million compared to the prior year  due to the sale of a portion of our interest in the synthetic fuel operation on december  lower taxable income in also reduced the amount of tax credits that could be claimed 
our ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation resulted in the recognition of million of section tax credits as a reduction of federal income tax expense in compared to million in discontinued operations the after tax loss from discontinued operations increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increased loss was largely due to a decrease in capacity sales in due to the expiration of a sales contract  an increase in variable production expenses related to increased emission costs  and an increase in operating costs 
operating costs increased in as a result of issues related to fuel quality and associated mechanical difficulties involving fuel delivery systems early in  operational issues related to newly installed environmental equipment in various boilers  and turbine outages 
the increase in the loss from discontinued operations was partially offset by decreases in payroll and employee benefits as a result of a restructuring that took place at the end of balance sheet wps resources compared with current assets from risk management activities decreased million  or  at december   compared to december   and current liabilities from risk management activities decreased million  or 
long term assets from risk management activities decreased million  or  at december   compared to december   and long term liabilities from risk management activities decreased million  or 
the decrease in short term risk management assets and liabilities was primarily related to changes in the forward price curve of natural gas 
the decrease in long term risk management assets and liabilities was driven by lower natural gas volumes under contract beyond one year and changes in the forward price curve for natural gas 
property  plant  and equipment  net  increased million to  million at december   compared to  million at december  this increase was mostly due to a million increase in property  plant  and equipment at wpsc primarily related to capital expenditures associated with the construction of weston and the installation of automated meter reading 
regulatory assets increased million  from million at december   to million at december   largely due to the increase in environmental remediation liabilities related to manufactured gas plants at wpsc  as discussed below 
wpsc expects to recover cleanup costs related to the manufactured gas plants  net of insurance recoveries  in future rates 
short term debt increased million  from million at december   to million at december  retirements of long term debt and increased capital expenditures primarily related to weston drove the increase in short term debt 
current portion of long term debt decreased from million at december   to million at december  on january   wpsc retired early million of its series first mortgage bonds 
these bonds had an original maturity date of july  accounts payable increased million  from million at december   to million at december  accounts payable at wpsc increased million  driven by expenditures related to weston accounts payable at esi increased million  primarily as a result of higher natural gas prices compared to the prior year 
the environmental remediation liability increased million from december   to december  this liability primarily relates to clean up costs associated with several manufactured gas plant sites at wpsc see note to wps resources consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies  for more information 
wpsc s estimate of future clean up costs required to remediate these sites increased significantly to reflect the wdnr s application of sediment guidance that was recently issued 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased million  or  from december   to december   primarily due to a reduction in the minimum pension liability 
the decrease in the minimum pension liability was driven by wps resources merger of its two non contributory qualified retirement plans 
on a combined basis  the minimum pension liability and related pension asset were reduced pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles 
liquidity and capital resources wps resources we believe that our cash balances  liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to equity capital markets and borrowing capacity made available because of strong credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  our operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies 
currently  we believe these ratings are among the best in the energy industry see financing cash flows  credit ratings below 
operating cash flows during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in the increase was driven by operating activities at esi and wpsc 
in  operating activities at esi used cash due primarily to increasing working capital requirements resulting from business growth and gas storage opportunities near the end of the year 
esi s natural gas operations did not experience the same level of growth in as they did in  and storage opportunities were similar at the end of both years  which enabled esi to generate additional operating cash flow in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at wpsc was driven by improved operating results 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to increased working capital requirements  specifically at esi and wpsc 
inventories increased due to high natural gas prices at both esi and wpsc  as well as business growth at esi 
the inventory increase was also the result of esi taking advantage of opportunities to put additional gas into storage at favorable relationships to forward prices 
the change in receivables and payables was also attributable to the high natural gas prices as well as the business growth at esi 
investing cash flows net cash used for investing activities was million in  compared to million in the increase was largely related to a million increase in utility capital expenditures see capital expenditures below  partially offset by a million decrease in cash used for the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions 
purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions consisted primarily of additional investments in atc  capital contributions to eco coal pelletization llc  and the acquisition of advantage energy in in  purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions consisted primarily of wpsc s final payment for the purchase of the de pere energy center  wpsc s purchase of a one third interest in guardian pipeline  additional investments in atc  and capital contributions to eco coal pelletization 
wps resources contributed capital of million to eco coal pelletization in and million in see wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements  note acquisitions and sales of asset for more information 
net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease is largely attributed to a million decrease in capital expenditures  mainly at the utilities see capital expenditures below  as well as a million increase in cash received from the sale of property  plant  and equipment 
the majority of the increase in the sale of property  plant  and equipment was the result of wpsc s sale of million of assets at book value related to the wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line to atc in june partially offsetting this decrease was a million increase in cash used for the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions 
the composition of purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions in is discussed above 
in  the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions primarily related to pdi s acquisition of ch resources and a million capital contribution to eco coal pelletization 
see wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements  note acquisitions and sales of assets for more information 
capital expenditures capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended december    and are as follows millions years ended december  electric utility gas utility esi pdi other wps resources consolidated the increase in capital expenditures at the electric utility in as compared to is mainly due to higher capital expenditures associated with the construction of a megawatt coal fired weston generation facility located near wausau  wisconsin 
gas utility capital expenditures increased primarily due to the installation of automated meter reading 
capital expenditures at pdi and esi remained fairly consistent between and capital expenditures in the electric utility were higher in  as compared to  mainly due to the construction of portions of the pulliam combustion turbine at wpsc in gas utility capital expenditures increased due to the installation of automated meter reading in pdi s capital expenditures were higher in compared to due to the conversion of the combined locks energy center to a combined cycle system in capital expenditures at esi remained fairly consistent between and financing cash flows net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in less cash was required from financing activities as a result of the increase in cash generated from operating activities in  partially offset by higher capital expenditures incurred in net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in the million increase in cash provided by financing activities in is primarily related to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to a larger amount of investing activities was financed through common stock and debt issuances in as compared to the prior year 
significant financing activities wps resources had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of million and million at december   and  respectively 
wps resources had other outstanding short term debt of million and million as of december   and  respectively 
short term borrowings in were used primarily to fund capital expenditures related to weston in  and we issued new shares of common stock under our stock investment plan and under certain stock based employee benefit and compensation plans 
as a result of these plans  equity increased million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
on january   wpsc retired million of its series first mortgage bonds 
these bonds had an original maturity date of july  on january   wps resources retired million of its trust preferred securities 
as a result of this transaction  wpsr capital trust i  a delaware business trust  was dissolved 
wpsc issued million of year senior notes in december the senior notes are collateralized by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become non collateralized if wpsc retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to call million of first mortgage bonds on january   fund construction costs and capital additions  reduce short term indebtedness  and for other corporate utility purposes 
in november   shares of wps resources common stock were sold in a public offering at per share  which resulted in a net increase in equity of million 
net proceeds from this offering were used to retire the trust preferred securities in january  reduce short term debt  fund equity contributions to subsidiary companies  and for general corporate purposes 
in november  pdi retired all of its notes payable under a revolving credit note  in the amount of million wpsc called million of tax exempt bonds in may in march  uppco retired million of first mortgage bonds that had reached maturity 
wpsc used short term debt to retire million of first mortgage bonds on february   that had reached maturity 
wpsc issued million of year senior notes in december the senior notes are collateralized by a pledge of first mortgage bonds and may become non collateralized if wpsc retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds 
wpsc used approximately million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to acquire the de pere energy center and million to retire short term debt 
the balance of the net proceeds was used for other corporate utility purposes 
wps resources issued million of year senior non collateralized notes in november we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes to repay short term debt incurred to provide equity capital to our subsidiaries and the remainder for other corporate purposes 
in october  wpsc retired million of first mortgage bonds that had reached maturity 
credit ratings wps resources and wpsc use internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of their capital requirements 
wps resources also periodically issues long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt  maintain desired capitalization ratios  and fund future growth 
wps resources may seek nonrecourse financing for funding nonregulated acquisitions 
wps resources commercial paper borrowing program provides for working capital requirements of the nonregulated businesses and uppco 
wpsc has its own commercial paper borrowing program 
wpsc also periodically issues long term debt  receives equity contributions from wps resources  and makes payments for return of capital to wps resources to reduce short term debt  fund future growth  and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the pscw 
the specific forms of long term financing  amounts  and timing depend on the availability of projects  market conditions  and other factors 
the current credit ratings for wps resources and wpsc are listed in the table below 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s wps resources senior unsecured debt commercial paper credit line syndication a a a p a wpsc bonds preferred stock commercial paper credit line syndication a a a aa a p aa in january  standard poor s downgraded its ratings for wpsc one ratings level and established a negative outlook 
at the same time  standard poor s affirmed wps resources ratings but changed the outlook from stable to negative 
in taking these actions  standard poor s cited wpsc s substantial capital spending program and the risk profile of wpsr s nonregulated businesses 
in november  moody s downgraded its long term ratings for wps resources and wpsc one ratings level  leaving only commercial paper ratings unchanged 
moody s downgrade of wps resources was based principally on a gradual shift in the company s financial and business risk profile attributable to the growth of nonregulated businesses  the impact of weaker wholesale power markets  and a relatively high dividend payout 
moody s downgrade of wpsc was based on the expectation that the utility s substantial capital spending program will exceed its retained cash flow through  which is likely to lead to a meaningful increase in debt 
following the downgrade  moody s set the ratings outlook at stable for both wps resources and wpsc 
we believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry  and allow us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  are subject to change  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
rating agencies use a number of both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a company s credit rating 
these measures include business risk  liquidity risk  competitive position  capital mix  financial condition  predictability of cash flows  management strength  and future direction 
some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios  while the qualitative ones are more subjective 
wps resources and wpsc hold credit lines to back of their commercial paper borrowing and letters of credit 
these credit facilities are based on a credit rating of a p for wps resources and a p for wpsc 
a significant decrease in the commercial paper credit ratings could adversely affect the companies by increasing the interest rates at which they can borrow and potentially limiting the availability of funds to the companies through the commercial paper market 
a restriction in the companies ability to use commercial paper borrowing to meet their working capital needs would require them to secure funds through alternate sources resulting in higher interest expense  higher credit line fees  and a potential delay in the availability of funds 
esi maintains underlying agreements to support its electric and natural gas trading operations 
in the event of a deterioration of wps resources credit rating  many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand additional assurance of payment 
this provision could pertain to existing business  new business or both with the counterparty 
the additional assurance requirements could be met with letters of credit  surety bonds  or cash deposits and would likely result in wps resources being required to maintain increased bank lines of credit or incur additional expenses  and could restrict the amount of business esi can conduct 
esi uses the nymex and over the counter financial markets to hedge its exposure to physical customer obligations 
these hedges are closely correlated to the customer contracts  but price movements on the hedge contracts may require financial backing 
certain movements in price for contracts through the nymex exchange require posting of cash deposits equal to the market move 
for the over the counter market  the underlying contract may allow the counterparty to require additional collateral to cover the net financial differential between the original contract price and the current forward market 
increased requirements related to market price changes usually only result in a temporary liquidity need that will unwind as the sales contracts are fulfilled 
future capital requirements and resources contractual obligations the following table summarizes the contractual obligations of wps resources  including its subsidiaries 
contractual obligations as of december  millions payments due by period total amounts committed less than year to years to years over years long term debt principal and interest payments operating leases commodity purchase obligations purchase orders capital contributions to equity method investment other total contractual cash obligations long term debt principal and interest payments represent bonds issued  notes issued  and loans made to wps resources and its subsidiaries 
we record all principal obligations on the balance sheet 
commodity purchase obligations represent mainly commodity purchase contracts of wps resources and its subsidiaries 
energy supply contracts at esi included as part of commodity purchase obligations are generally entered into to meet obligations to deliver energy to customers 
wpsc and uppco expect to recover the costs of their contracts in future customer rates 
purchase orders include obligations related to normal business operations and large construction obligations  including of weston obligations even though we expect of these costs to be paid by dairyland power cooperative after certain conditions are met 
capital contributions to equity method investment include our commitment to fund a portion of the wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line 
other mainly represents expected pension and post retirement funding obligations 
capital requirements wpsc makes large investments in capital assets 
net construction expenditures are expected to be approximately billion in the aggregate for the through period upon the closing of the sale of kewaunee  expenditures would decrease approximately million during this period 
the largest of these expenditures is for the construction of weston  in which wpsc is expected to incur costs of million between through  assuming ownership in  and ownership in and after the expected purchase of a interest in weston by dairyland power cooperative 
as part of its regulated utility operations  on september   wpsc submitted an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the pscw seeking approval to construct weston  a megawatt coal fired generation facility near wausau  wisconsin 
the facility is estimated to cost approximately million including the acquisition of coal trains 
as of december   wpsc has incurred a total cost of million related to this project 
in addition  wpsc expects to incur additional construction costs through the date the plant goes into service of approximately million to fund construction of the transmission facilities required to support weston atc will reimburse wpsc for the construction costs of the interconnection and related carrying costs when weston becomes commercially operational which is expected to occur in june on october   we received the final pscw order granting authority to proceed with construction of weston contingent upon receipt of an air permit 
the air permit was issued by the wdnr on october  we believe the air permit is one of the most stringent in the nation  which means that weston will be one of the cleanest plants of its kind in the united states 
construction began in october  and on november   a petition was filed with the wdnr contesting the air permit issued 
on december   the wdnr granted the petition and forwarded the matter to the division of hearings and appeals 
construction continues and it is anticipated that the contested case hearing will be held in the second half of other significant anticipated expenditures during this three year period to include mercury and pollution control projects million corporate services infrastructures million jointly owned megawatt base load plant million nuclear fuel million other capital requirements for the three year period include a potential contribution of million to the kewaunee decommissioning trust fund if the sale of kewaunee is not completed 
on april   the pscw approved wpsc s request to transfer its interest in the wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line to the atc 
wps resources committed to fund of total project costs incurred up to million  and receive additional equity in atc 
wps resources may terminate funding if the project extends beyond january  on december   wpsc and atc received approval to continue the project at a new cost estimate of million 
the updated cost estimate reflects additional costs for the project resulting from time delays  added regulatory requirements  changes and additions to the project at the request of local governments  and atc overhead costs 
completion of the line is expected in wps resources has the right  but not the obligation  to provide additional funding in excess of million up to its portion of the revised cost estimate 
for the period through  we expect to make capital contributions of approximately million for our portion of the wausau to duluth transmission line 
our commitment to fund this transmission line could decrease up to if minnesota power exercises its option to fund a portion of the project 
wps resources expects to provide additional capital contributions to atc of approximately million for the period through for other projects 
uppco is expected to incur construction expenditures of about million in the aggregate for the period through  primarily for electric distribution improvements and repairs and safety measures at hydroelectric facilities 
capital expenditures identified at pdi for through are expected to be approximately million  primarily for fuel improvements and blade replacement at wps empire state 
capital expenditures identified at esi for through are expected to be approximately million  largely due to the advantage energy acquisition and computer equipment related to business expansion and normal technology upgrades 
all projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly from the estimates depending on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints  acquisition opportunities  market volatility  and economic trends 
other capital expenditures for wps resources and its subsidiaries for through could be significant depending on its success in pursuing development and acquisition opportunities 
when appropriate  wps resources may seek nonrecourse financing for a portion of the cost of these acquisitions 
capital resources as of december   both wps resources and wpsc were in compliance with all of the covenants under their lines of credit and other debt obligations 
for the period through  wps resources plans to use internally generated funds net of forecasted dividend payments  cash proceeds from pending asset sales  and debt and equity financings to fund capital requirements 
wps resources plans to maintain debt to equity ratios at appropriate levels to support current ratings and corporate growth 
management believes wps resources has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs 
wps resources has the ability to issue up to an additional million of debt or equity under its currently effective shelf registration statement 
wpsc has the ability to issue up to an additional million of debt under its currently effective shelf registration statements 
the shelf registrations are subject to the ultimate terms and conditions to be determined prior to the actual issuance of specific securities 
wps resources and wpsc have day credit line facilities for million and million  respectively 
the credit lines are used to back of wps resources and wpsc s commercial paper borrowing programs and letters of credit for wps resources 
as of december   there was a total of million and million available under wps resources and wpsc s credit lines  respectively 
in  wps resources announced the sale of sunbury  and wpsc announced the sale of its portion of kewaunee 
we anticipate being able to complete the sale of sunbury in see the kewaunee paragraph below for a discussion on this potential sale 
a portion of the proceeds related to the sunbury sale may be used to pay the non recourse debt related to the plant 
a portion of the proceeds related to the kewaunee sale will be used to retire debt at wpsc 
the remainder of the proceeds from both the sunbury and kewaunee sales will be used by wps resources for investing activities and general corporate purposes of its subsidiaries  including reducing the amount of outstanding debt 
for more information regarding the sunbury and kewaunee sales  see the discussion below 
other future considerations sunbury wps resources made capital contributions of million to sunbury in to compensate for the impact of lower capacity revenues  as well as adjustments to sunbury s operating plan 
these funds have been used to cover operating losses  make principal and interest payments  and purchase emission allowances 
in  wps resources board of directors granted authorization to contribute up to million of additional capital to sunbury 
of that amount  million remains available in  as authorized by wps resources board of directors 
on september   pdi received a letter of termination from duquesne power  lp related to the previously announced agreement to sell sunbury to duquesne for approximately million 
duquesne issued its letter of termination following a determination by the pennsylvania public utility commission not to reconsider its earlier approved provider of last resort plan  which duquesne believed did not satisfy a closing condition in the agreement 
pdi is continuing its efforts to sell sunbury 
the carrying value of sunbury is about million  and this project carries approximately million of project financed debt 
based upon consideration of all information available at this time  management determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of sunbury was required in although management cannot predict the precise timetable or ultimate outcome  pdi is progressing with the sale process  and anticipates being able to complete the sale of sunbury in kewaunee on november   wpsc entered into a definitive agreement to sell its ownership interest in kewaunee to a subsidiary of dominion resources  inc the other joint owner of kewanee  wisconsin power and light company  also agreed to sell its ownership interest in kewaunee to dominion 
the transaction is subject to approvals from various regulatory agencies  of which all major approvals have been obtained  except for approval by the pscw 
the pscw rejected the sale on november  however  wpsc  wisconsin power and light company  and dominion resources  inc offered a proposal addressing the pscw s concerns in december in january  the pscw agreed to reconsider its decision on this transaction and we expect a decision to be rendered in march wpsc estimates that its share of the cash proceeds from the sale will approximate million  subject to various post closing adjustments 
the cash proceeds from the sale are expected to slightly exceed the carrying value of the wpsc assets being sold 
in addition to the cash proceeds  wpsc will retain ownership of the assets contained in its non qualified decommissioning trust  one of two funds that were established to cover the eventual decommissioning of kewaunee 
the net of tax fair value of the non qualified decommissioning trust s assets at december   was million 
dominion will assume responsibility for the eventual decommissioning of kewaunee and will receive wpsc s qualified decommissioning trust assets that had a net of tax fair value of million at december  wpsc has requested deferral of the gain or loss resulting from this transaction and related costs from the pscw 
accordingly  the gain or loss on the sale of the plant assets and the related non qualified decommissioning trust assets are expected to be returned to customers under future rate orders 
on february   kewaunee was temporarily removed from service after a potential design weakness was identified in a backup cooling system 
plant engineering staff identified the concern and the unit was shutdown in accordance with the plant license 
a modification is being made to resolve the issue and it is anticipated that the unit will be back in service at power by mid april 
wpsc intends to file a request with the pscw for recovery of incremental costs associated with fuel  purchased power  and operating and maintenance costs 
wpsc and dominion remain committed to the sale of kewaunee 
asset management strategy wps resources is finalizing its sales strategy for the balance of its identified excess real estate holdings 
this strategy is expected to provide for wps resources to meet its average annualized earnings per share goal 
regulatory for a discussion of regulatory considerations  see note  regulatory environment  to wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements 
american jobs creation act of on october   the president of the united states signed into law the american jobs creation act of jobs act 
the jobs act introduces a new deduction  the united states production activities deduction 
this domestic production provision allows as a deduction an amount equal to a specified percent of the lesser of the qualified production activities income of the taxpayer for the taxable year or taxable income for the taxable year 
the deduction is phased in  providing a deduction of three percent of income through  a six percent deduction through  and a nine percent deduction after on december   the fasb issued final staff position fsp  effective the same day  on accounting for the effects of the domestic production deduction provisions 
the fsp said the deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction rather than a tax rate reduction 
the fsp also said the special deduction should be considered by an enterprise in measuring deferred taxes when graduated tax rates are a significant factor and also in assessing if a valuation allowance is necessary 
on december   the pscw issued an order authorizing wpsc to defer of the revenue requirements impacts resulting from the jobs act 
the internal revenue service and department of treasury issued interim guidance on january   covering the implementation of the domestic production provision of the jobs act 
wps resources is currently reviewing this guidance in order to quantify the tax impact of this deduction or identify all potential tax issues related to the jobs act 
however  pursuant to regulatory treatment  wps resources expects any tax benefits derived from utility operations to be deferred and passed on to customers in future rates 
section federal tax credits the current rise in oil prices may result in a reduction or elimination of the section federal tax credits expected for future years 
a phase out or elimination of the section federal tax credits would have no impact on the value of alternative minimum tax credits wps resources is carrying forward as a result of prior production of section federal tax credits 
wps resources is assessing the impact of this issue on future operations and evaluating alternatives to potentially protect the ongoing economic benefits of the synthetic fuel facility 
guarantees and off balance sheet arrangements wps resources as part of normal business  wps resources and its subsidiaries enter into various guarantees providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries 
these guarantees are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand alone basis  thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries intended commercial purposes 
the guarantees issued by wps resources include inter company guarantees between parents and their subsidiaries  which are eliminated in consolidation  and guarantees of the subsidiaries own performance 
as such  these guarantees are excluded from the recognition  measurement  and disclosure requirements of fin no

wps resources board of directors has authorized management to issue corporate guarantees in the aggregate amount of up to billion to support the business operations of esi 
wps resources primarily issues the guarantees to counterparties in the wholesale electric and natural gas marketplace to provide counterparties the assurance that esi will perform on its obligations and permit esi to operate within these markets 
the amount of guarantees actually issued by wps resources to support the business operations at esi at december   was million  and this is reflected in the table above 
these guarantees reflect the amount of outstanding business esi could have with the counterparties holding the guarantees at any point in time 
at december   the actual amount of esi s obligations to counterparties supported by wps resources parental guarantees was million 
at december   wps resources had issued million in corporate guarantees to support the business operation of pdi  which are reflected in the above table 
wps resources issues the guarantees for indemnification obligations related to business purchase agreements and counterparties in the wholesale electric marketplace to meet their credit requirements and permit pdi to operate within these markets 
the amount supported is dependent on the amount of the outstanding obligations that pdi has with the parties holding the guarantees at any point in time 
at december   the amount of pdi s obligations supported by wps resources parental guarantees was million 
in february  wps resources board of directors authorized management to issue corporate guarantees in the aggregate amount of up to million to support business operations at pdi in addition to guarantees that receive specific wps resources board authorization 
another million of corporate guarantees support energy and transmission supply at uppco and are not reflected on wps resources consolidated balance sheet 
in february  wps resources board of directors authorized management to issue corporate guarantees in the aggregate amount of up to million to support the business operations of uppco 
corporate guarantees issued in the future under the board authorized limit may or may not be reflected on wps resources consolidated balance sheet  depending on the nature of the guarantee 
at wps resources request  financial institutions have issued million in standby letters of credit for the benefit of third parties that have extended credit to certain subsidiaries 
if a subsidiary does not pay amounts when due under a covered contract  the counterparty may present its claim for payment to the financial institution  which will request payment from wps resources 
any amounts owed by our subsidiaries are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   wps resources furnished million of surety bonds for various reasons including worker compensation coverage and obtaining various licenses  permits  and rights of way 
liabilities incurred as a result of activities covered by surety bonds are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
the other guarantee of million listed on the above table was issued by wpsc to indemnify a third party for exposures related to the construction of utility assets

r requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties 
market price risk management activities wps resources market price risk management activities include the electric and natural gas marketing and related risk management activities of esi 
esi s marketing and trading operations manage power and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments 
derivative instruments are utilized in these operations 
esi measures the fair value of derivative instruments including nymex exchange and over the counter contracts  natural gas options  natural gas and electric power physical fixed price contracts  basis contracts  and related financial instruments on a mark to market basis 
the fair value of derivatives is shown as assets or liabilities from risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the offsetting entry to assets or liabilities from risk management activities is to other comprehensive income or earnings  depending on the use of the derivative  how it is designated  and if it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the fair values of derivative instruments are adjusted each reporting period using various market sources and risk management systems 
the primary input for natural gas pricing is the settled forward price curve of the nymex exchange  which includes contracts and options 
basis pricing is derived from published indices and documented broker quotes 
esi bases electric prices on published indices and documented broker quotes 
the following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of esi s assets and liabilities from risk management activities for the months ended december  esi mark to market roll forward millions natural gas electric total fair value of contracts at january  less contracts realized or settled during period plus changes in fair value of contracts in existence at december  fair value of contracts at december  the fair value of contracts at january   and december   reflects the values reported on the balance sheet for net mark to market current and long term risk management assets and liabilities as of those dates 
contracts realized or settled during the period includes the value of contracts in existence at january   that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of december   along with the amortization of those derivatives later designated as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
changes in fair value of existing contracts include unrealized gains and losses on contracts that existed at january   and contracts that were entered into subsequent to january   which are included in esi s portfolio at december  there were  in many cases  offsetting positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period 
the realized gains or losses from these offsetting positions are not reflected in the table above 
market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts 
the table below shows the sources of fair value and maturity of esi s risk management instruments 
esi risk management contract aging at fair value as of december  source of fair value millions maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity in excess of years total fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total fair value we derive the pricing for most contracts in the above table from active quotes or external sources 
prices actively quoted includes nymex contracts and basis swaps 
prices provided by external sources includes electric and natural gas contract positions for which pricing information is obtained primarily through broker quotes 
prices based on models and other valuation methods includes electric contracts for which reliable external pricing information does not exist 
esi  as a result of pdi s ownership of generating assets in new york  has acquired transmission congestion contracts  which are financial contracts  that hedge price risk between zones within the new york independent system operator 
the contracts were marked to fair value using a combination of modeled forward prices and market quotes 
the fair market value of the contracts at december   was million 
esi employs a variety of physical and financial instruments offered in the marketplace to limit risk exposure associated with fluctuating commodity prices and volumes  enhance value  and minimize cash flow volatility 
however  the application of hedge accounting rules causes esi to experience earnings volatility associated with electric and natural gas operations 
while risks associated with power generating capacity and power sales are economically hedged  certain transactions do not meet the definition of a derivative or qualify for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles 
consequently  gains and losses from the generating capacity do not always match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods 
the result can cause volatility in esi s reported period by period earnings  however  the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse at the time of physical delivery and or settlement of the hedge transaction 
the accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions 
at december   the unrealized mark to market gains were million for esi s electric operations and related hedges that did not qualify for cash flow hedge treatment under sfas no 
see results of operations overview of nonregulated operations esi s segment operations for information regarding earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle 
critical accounting policies wps resources we have identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
wps resources management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
risk management activities wps resources has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
at december   those derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily commodity contracts to manage price risk associated with wholesale and retail natural gas purchase and sale activities and electric energy contracts 
management s expectations and intentions are key factors in determining the appropriate accounting for a derivative transaction  and as a result  such expectations and intentions are documented 
cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when wps resources contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases 
fair value hedge accounting may be used when wps resources holds firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk that the price of a commodity may change between the contract s inception and the physical delivery date of the commodity 
to the extent that the fair value of a hedge instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge 
in addition  wps resources may apply the normal purchases and sales exemption  provided by sfas no 
 as amended  to certain contracts 
the normal purchases and sales exception provides that no recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until the settlement of the contract 
derivative contracts that are determined to fall within the scope of sfas no 
 as amended  are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet of wps resources 
changes in fair value  except those related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  are generally included in the determination of income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled 
when available  quoted market prices are used to record a contract s fair value 
if no active trading market exists for a commodity or for a contract s duration  fair value is estimated through the use of internally developed valuation techniques or models 
such estimates require significant judgment as to assumptions and valuation methodologies deemed appropriate by wps resources management 
as a component of the fair value determination  wps resources maintains reserves to account for the estimated direct costs of servicing and holding certain of its contracts based upon administrative costs  credit counterparty risk  and servicing margin with both fixed and variable components 
the effect of changing the underlying servicing and credit counterparty risk assumptions is as follows change in assumption millions effect to operating reserve at december  increase decrease these potential changes to the operating reserve would be shown as part of the nonregulated cost of fuel  gas and purchased power on the consolidated statements of income and current and long term assets liabilities from risk management activities on the consolidated balance sheets 
asset impairment wps resources annually reviews its assets for impairment 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  form the basis for these analyses 
the review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to pdi than to our other segments because of its significant investment in property  plant  and equipment and lack of access to regulatory relief that is available to our regulated segments 
at december   the carrying value of pdi s property  plant  and equipment totaled million  excluding assets held for sale  which totaled million 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of power plants is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future market sales pricing  production costs  capital expenditures and generation volumes and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
management s assumptions about future market sales prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual market sales prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs  environmental changes  and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the primary estimates used at pdi in the impairment analysis are future revenue streams and operating costs 
a combination of input from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams 
pdi s operations group forecasts future operating costs with input from external sources for fuel costs and forward energy prices 
these estimates are modeled over the projected remaining life of the power plants using the methodology defined in sfas no 
pdi evaluates property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
these indicators include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
sfas no 
requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
for assets held for sale  impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value of such assets exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
throughout  pdi tested its power plants for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
no impairment charges were recorded in as a result of these recoverability tests 
results of past impairment tests may not necessarily be an indicator of future tests given the criticality of the accounting estimates involved  as discussed more fully above 
changes in actual results or assumptions could result in an impairment 
wpsc recorded goodwill of million in its gas utility segment following the merger of wisconsin fuel and light into wpsc in the goodwill is tested for impairment yearly based on the guidance of sfas no 
the test for impairment includes assumptions about future profitability of the gas utility segment and the correlation between our gas utility segment and published projections for other similar gas utility segments 
a significant change in the natural gas utility market and or our projections of future profitability could result in a loss being recorded on the income statement related to a decrease in the goodwill asset as a result of the impairment test 
receivables and reserves our regulated natural gas and electric utilities and esi accrue estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed 
estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes  recorded sales  and weather factors 
the estimated unbilled sales are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations 
at december    and  the amount of unbilled revenues was million  million  and million  respectively 
any difference between actual sales and the estimates or weather factors would cause a change in the estimated revenue 
wps resources records reserves for potential uncollectible customer accounts as an expense on the income statement and an uncollectible reserve on the balance sheet 
wpsc records a regulatory asset to offset its uncollectible reserve 
because the nonregulated energy marketing business involves higher credit risk  the reserve is more critical to esi than to our other segments 
at esi  the reserve is based on historical uncollectible experience and specific customer identification where practical 
if the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect  or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults  there could be significant changes to the expense and uncollectible reserve balance 
pension and postretirement benefits the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits  described in note to the consolidated financial statements  are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience 
pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan  and earnings on plan assets 
other postretirement benefit costs are also impacted by health care cost trends 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  discount rates used in determining the projected benefit and other postretirement benefit obligation and pension and other postretirement benefit costs  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
wps resources pension plan assets and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at our regulated segments through the ratemaking process 
the following chart shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation  the net amount recognized on the balance sheet  and the reported annual pension cost on the income statement as they relate to all of our defined benefit pension plans 
each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only

to select an assumed rate of return on plan assets  we consider the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target allocation of the benefit trust portfolios 
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  we consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
regulatory accounting the electric and gas utility segments of wps resources follow sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
we defer certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as expenses and revenues because our regulators have authorized deferral as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  but is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  we amortize the regulatory assets and liabilities into income over the rate recovery period 
if recovery of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income 
if our electric and gas utility segments no longer meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
 we would discontinue its application as defined under sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of sfas no 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred 
a write off of all wps resources regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in a decrease in total assets  an decrease in total liabilities  and a increase in income before taxes 
tax provision as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance  which is offset by an expense within the tax provisions in the income statement 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the assumptions involved are supported by historical data and reasonable projections 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on wps resources financial condition and results of operations 
related party transactions wps resources wps resources has investments in related parties that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these include wps investments  llc s a consolidated subsidiary of wps resources investments in atc and guardian pipeline  wpsc s investment in wisconsin river power company  and wps nuclear corporation s a consolidated subsidiary of wps resources investment in nuclear management company

energy and capacity prices prices for electric energy and capacity have been extremely volatile over the past three years 
wps resources nonregulated entities are impacted by this volatility  which has been driven by the exit of many of the largest speculative traders  equilibrium between natural gas supply and demand  changes in the economy  and significant overbuilding of generation capacity 
although electric energy prices are currently high due to increased natural gas prices  we expect that electric capacity prices will continue to be depressed for several years 
pressure on capacity prices will continue until existing reserve margins are depleted either by load growth or capacity retirements 
pdi has been negatively impacted by the depressed capacity prices and volatile energy prices discussed above  and as a result we have taken certain steps to reduce our exposure to the merchant marketplace 
in  pdi entered into tolling agreements with esi to market electric production from its facilities and to manage natural gas costs for its gas fired generation facilities 
esi is utilizing various financial tools  including forwards and options  to limit exposure and extract additional value from volatile commodity prices 
pdi continues to manage costs of fuel for its coal fired facilities

industry restructuring the ohio legislature passed a senate bill in may instituting market based rates  competitive retail electric services and establishing a market development period that began january   and was to end no later than december  this bill required ohio electric distribution companies to file electric transition plans  including the collection of transition costs and freezing generation rates at a discount during the course of the market development period 
at the end of the market development period  rates would be set at a market based price 
however  the public utilities commission of ohio  recognizing the competitive electric market has not developed as envisioned and fearing rate shock at the end of the market development period  requested the ohio electric distribution utilities to file rate stabilization plans covering the time period 
the rate stabilization plans are expected to provide rate certainty  financial stability for the electric distribution utilities  and to further develop the competitive market 
since  esi has been the supplier to approximately  residential  small commercial  and government facilities in the firstenergy service areas under the state of ohio provisions for opt out electric aggregation programs 
on june   the public utilities commission of ohio ordered a competitive bid auction be developed and conducted and approved a modified version of the rate stabilization plan submitted by firstenergy 
the firstenergy rate stabilization plan would establish electric rates consumers would pay beginning in if the auction does not produce better benefits 
esi participated as an intervener in the firstenergy rate stabilization plan and competitive bid process cases in an effort to preserve the competitive electric business established in the firstenergy service areas in the time period 
esi filed comments requesting modifications to the competitive bid process to allow for fair competition 
in october  the public utilities commission of ohio issued orders directing firstenergy to modify the competitive bid process based on filed comments and direction from independent consultants and scheduled the auction for december  the competitive bid process was conducted on december   concluding the same day 
on december   the public utility commission of ohio rejected the auction price citing the clearing price of cents per kilowatt hour was inadequate in comparison to the firstenergy rate stabilization plan 
while the details of the rate comparison and auction results have not been made public  the public utility commission of ohio requested stakeholder comments relative to what information to maintain as confidential and for what period of time 
the public utility commission of ohio intends to conduct a similar auction next year  believing the economy of the power market will improve  increasing the probability of an acceptable auction clearing price 
given the auction results  the firstenergy rate stabilization plan will be implemented 
esi participated in recent case developments relative to the price to be paid by customers who return from competitive supply to default service during the rate stabilization plan period 
continued service by esi beyond december   to customers of the existing aggregation programs will be dependent on the ability of the communities to comply with the firstenergy rate stabilization plan requirements imposed on governmental aggregation programs and improved market power prices 
meanwhile  on september   an ohio house bill was introduced  proposing change to the electric restructuring law 
the bill proposes to give the public utilities commission of ohio explicit authority to implement rate stabilization plans  where it has been determined that there is insufficient development of the generation market or lack of effective competition in an electric utility s service area and ensuring against any undue competitive disadvantage between ohio and regional customers of an electric utility of its affiliates 
recent news releases indicate an increased momentum in the ohio general assembly for legislation that would make major changes to senate bill in on july   senate bills were introduced in michigan to amend legislation enacted in june  which initially established a competitive supply alternative for customers in the state s electricity market 
on october   senate bill s was introduced as a substitute for senate bill as the michigan legislature closed out with this package of bills not being voted out of the senate energy and technology committee  they must be reintroduced and sponsored again  if they are to be addressed in it is our expectation that such a move will be initiated early in under current legislation  michigan s regulated utilities were able to securitize overrun costs associated with large generation assets and the mpsc was provided the authority to administer the electric choice program to ensure the interests of all stakeholders were met 
under the current electric choice program  esi  through its subsidiary quest energy  llc  has established itself as a significant supplier to the industrial and commercial markets  achieving contract demand levels of approximately megawatts  and annual sales volumes of million megawatt hours 
the initial senate bills contained provisions that would have substantially harmed the electric choice market and returned michigan to a model of the regulated supply monopoly 
if similar legislation is proposed and passed in  it could diminish the benefits of competitive supply for michigan business customers 
the impact on esi could range from maintaining michigan business with little or no growth  to an inability to re contract any business  leading to a possible decision by esi to exit michigan s electric market and redirect resources to more vibrant markets 
it is not unreasonable to expect changes that will have some level of negative impact on esi  but it would be unlikely that michigan customers will lose all of the benefits of competition and revert back to a fully regulated monopoly supply 
esi is actively participating in the legislative and regulatory process in order to protect its interests in michigan 
wpsc  uppco  and esi are members of the midwest independent system operator iso  which is in the process of restructuring the bulk electric power market across its footprint 
the implementation of market restructuring by the midwest iso is currently expected to occur april  such restructuring could have an impact on the costs associated with serving utility customers energy requirements  however  given the anticipated regulatory treatment of any potential cost differences  wpsc does not currently expect the ultimate outcome will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
wpsc  uppco  and esi are working closely with the midwest iso and the ferc to ensure that there is a smooth transition to the new market in order to minimize any impact on them and their customers 
esi currently participates in markets that have gone through comparable transitions 
we believe this past experience has prepared esi for the midwest iso transition and positions esi to manage the risk and pursue the opportunities that will exist 
seams elimination charge adjustment esi has identified an issue that could create financial exposure through march through a series of orders issued by ferc  regional through and out rates for transmission service between the midwest iso and the pjm interconnection have been eliminated effective december  the ferc ordered a transitional pricing mechanism called the seams elimination charge adjustment seca to be put into place on december   through march   which would be paid by load serving entities 
the purpose of the seca is to compensate transmission owners during the month transition period for the revenue they would no longer receive due to the elimination of the regional through and out rates 
because esi is a load serving entity  it will be billed for seca charges based on its power imports during and although actual seca charges have only been calculated for the first months of the month period  total exposure for the month transitional period is estimated to be approximately million for michigan and million for ohio 
on february   ferc issued an order accepting compliance filings implementing the seca effective december   subject to refund and surcharge  as appropriate  and setting the case in its entirety for a formal hearing 
it is anticipated that the case could take a year or more to reach a final decision 
in addition  matters related to the justness and reasonableness and other legal challenges to the seca itself remain pending before ferc on rehearing 
it is not known when ferc will issue an order on these requests for rehearing 
it appears that esi will be required to pay the seca charges during this process  subject to refund 
esi has actively participated in the seca case since its beginning and believes its position has strong merits 
the application and legality of the seca is being challenged by many other load serving entities and esi will continue to pursue all avenues to appeal and or reduce the seca obligations 
in the interim  the exposure will be managed through customer charges and other available avenues  where feasible 
through existing contracts  esi has the ability to pass seca charges on to customers 
however  doing so may hinder esi s competitiveness in the marketplace 
new accounting pronouncements see note v  new accounting pronouncements  for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
impact of inflation wps resources our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions  wpsc s and uppco s projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues 
because rate forecasting assumes inflation  most of the inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates 
however  in these forecasts  wpsc and uppco are only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation 
our nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs 
however  any increase from inflation is offset with projected business growth 
therefore  the estimated effect of inflation on our nonregulated businesses is minor 
results of operations wisconsin public service wpsc is a regulated electric and natural gas utility as well as a holding company exempt from the public utility holding company act of electric operations accounted for approximately of revenues in  while natural gas operations contributed to revenues 
compared with wisconsin public service overview wpsc s results of operations for the years ended december are shown in the following table wisconsin public service s results millions change operating revenues earnings on common stock approved retail and wholesale electric rate increases drove a million increase in wpsc s electric revenue 
the million increase in wpsc s natural gas revenue was driven by an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas and an authorized retail natural gas rate increase  partially offset by a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes resulting from unfavorable weather conditions 
wpsc s earnings on common stock were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in as discussed in more detail below  the following factors impacted earnings for the year ended december   compared to the same period in approved rate increases including the impact of timely retail electric rate relief in  compared to the delay in receiving retail electric rate relief in favorably impacted the electric margin 
an approved retail natural gas rate increase favorably impacted the natural gas margin at wpsc  but a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes partially offset the favorable impact of this rate increase 
land sales  land donations  and higher earnings from equity investments favorably impacted earnings 
higher operating and maintenance expense negatively impacted earnings 
electric utility operations electric utility results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility revenue increased largely due to authorized retail and wholesale electric rate increases for wpsc s wisconsin and michigan customers see discussion within results of operations wps resources to recover higher fuel and purchased power costs  increased operating expenses  and expenditures incurred for infrastructure improvements 
electric utility sales volumes were also slightly higher in  increasing over sales volumes 
a increase in sales volumes to commercial and industrial customers was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes to residential customers 
higher sales volumes to our commercial and industrial customers reflect an improving economy and growth within our service area  while the decrease in sales volumes to residential customers reflects weather that was cooler during the cooling season  compared to wpsc s electric margin increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the increase in wpsc s electric margin is primarily related to the retail and wholesale electric rate increases  partially offset by a million increase in purchased power costs 
the quantity of power purchased in increased over purchases and purchased power costs were higher on a per unit basis in  compared to the pscw allows wpsc to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs are in excess of plus or minus from approved levels 
in response to a request for additional fuel cost recovery filed early in  wpsc was allowed to recover million of its increased fuel and purchased power costs during the pscw also allowed wpsc to defer million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs directly associated with the extension of the kewaunee refueling outage in the fourth quarter of the kewaunee outage was extended three weeks due primarily to difficulties encountered with lifting equipment related to the reactor vessel and procedures to perform the lifts 
it is anticipated that these costs will be recovered in  pending final approval 
wpsc s electric earnings increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the increased earnings were largely driven by the higher margin including the effect of timely retail electric rate relief in compared to a delay in receiving retail electric rate relief in  partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses 
gas utility operations gas utility results millions change revenues purchase costs margins throughput in therms gas utility revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to higher revenue was driven by an authorized rate increase and an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas  partially offset by an overall decrease in natural gas throughput volumes 
natural gas prices increased per unit in higher natural gas prices reflect higher marketplace natural gas costs in the pscw and the mpsc allow wpsc to pass changes in the total cost of natural gas on to customers 
as a result  changes in the price of the natural gas commodity do not have a direct impact on wpsc s margin 
the decrease in natural gas throughput volumes was driven by weather that was warmer during the heating season for the year ended december   compared to the natural gas utility margin increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the higher natural gas utility margin is largely due to the authorized rate increase mentioned above 
the ability of wpsc to realize the full benefit of an authorized rate increase is dependent upon normal throughput volumes  therefore  the decrease in natural gas throughput volumes negatively impacted wpsc s ability to benefit from the full amount of the rate increase 
the higher margin drove a million  or  increase in gas utility earnings for the year ended december  operating expenses operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expenses at wpsc increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to electric transmission and distribution costs were up million due primarily to an increase in transmission rates 
pension and postretirement medical costs incurred at wpsc increased million 
additionally  million of the increase was driven by amortization of costs incurred in conjunction with the implementation of the automated meter reading system and the purchase of the de pere energy center previously deferred as regulatory assets 
maintenance expenses at wpsc s coal fired generation facilities were million higher in  compared to  driven by an extension of the annual planned outage at the pulliam generation facility in higher payroll and other benefit costs also contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
the fall refueling outage at kewaunee did not significantly impact the year over year change in operating and maintenance expenses as there was also a refueling outage at kewaunee in the spring of  and the pscw approved the deferral of incremental operating and maintenance expenses that were incurred as a direct result of the refueling outage extension million of operating and maintenance expenses were deferred in the fourth quarter of and collection is anticipated in  pending approval by the pscw 
depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to  due primarily to a decrease of million resulting from lower realized gains on decommissioning trust assets and because the decommissioning trust was not funded in in anticipation of selling kewaunee 
realized gains on decommissioning trust assets are substantially offset by depreciation expense pursuant to regulatory practice 
an increase in depreciation expense from plant asset additions at wpsc partially offset the decrease in decommissioning expense 
other income other income decreased million  from million in to million in  largely due to a decrease in realized gains on decommissioning trust assets of million 
lower realized gains were substantially offset by lower decommissioning expense  as discussed above 
partially offsetting the lower gains on decommissioning trust assets were higher earnings realized from equity investments and an increase in gains recognized from land sales in  compared to compared with wisconsin public service overview wpsc s and results of operations are shown in the following table wisconsin public service s results millions change operating revenues earnings on common stock wisconsin retail electric and wholesale electric rate increases together with higher natural gas prices contributed to the increase in operating revenues in wpsc s earnings on common stock were million in compared with million in as discussed in more detail below  the following factors impacted year over year earnings electric rate increases and a change in sales mix at wpsc favorably impacted electric margins 
favorable weather conditions had a favorable impact on the natural gas margin  but the impact of favorable weather conditions was largely offset by a decrease in natural gas rates allowed by the pscw 
cooler weather during the cooling season in negatively impacted electric utility margins 
rising operating expenses primarily pension and medical costs together with a delay in receiving retail electric rate relief negatively impacted electric utility earnings 
rate relief for these increasing operating costs was expected on january   however  the increase in retail electric rates granted by the pscw was not effective until march  electric utility operations electric utility results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenues increased million  or  in compared to the increase was largely due to the retail and wholesale electric rate increases for the wisconsin and michigan customers in accordance with new rate orders 
due primarily to the electric rate increases  electric margins at wpsc increased million  or  in electric margins were also impacted favorably by a change in sales mix in while total sales volumes remained basically unchanged in compared to  sales volumes to higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers increased slightly 
the increase in sales volumes to these higher margin customer classes reflects growth within wpsc s service area and changes in the economy 
these increases were partially offset by cooler weather during the cooling season for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gas utility operations gas utility results millions change revenues purchase costs margins throughput in therms gas utility revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in gas utility revenues was mostly due to a increase in the average cost of natural gas for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  partially offset by the decrease in retail natural gas rates ordered by the pscw  effective march  the natural gas utility margin for the year ended december   increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase in the natural gas utility margin can be attributed to a increase in natural gas throughput volumes in compared to natural gas throughput volumes to our higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers increased in the aggregate  mostly as a result of colder weather in compared to natural gas throughput volumes to our lower margin transport customers decreased due to the rising price of natural gas together with their ability to use alternate fuel sources 
operating expenses operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense operating and maintenance expense utility operating and maintenance expense increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
approximately million of the increase reflects higher pension  postretirement medical  and active medical costs 
the remaining increase pertains to costs incurred for plant maintenance related to kewaunee s scheduled refueling outage in there was no refueling outage in  additional operating expenses at kewaunee and wage increases 
depreciation and decommissioning expense utility depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  mostly related to an increase of million resulting from higher realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets that resulted in recording decommissioning expense approximately equal to the gains recognized in miscellaneous income pursuant to regulatory practice 
the remaining increase is related to plant asset additions 
other income other income increased million in  largely due to an increase in realized gains on the decommissioning trust assets of million 
the realized gains were offset by increased decommissioning expense  as discussed above 
gains recognized on hydroelectric land sales in compared to primarily due to the million pre tax gain recognized in from land sales to the wdnr were also higher in earnings from equity method investments also increased in compared to balance sheet wisconsin public service compared with net utility plant increased million  or  from december   to december  the increase in net utility plant primarily relates to capital expenditures associated with the construction of weston and the installation of automated meter reading 
pension assets decreased from million at december   to at december  the decrease in the pension assets was the result of the merger of wps resource s two non contributory qualified retirement plans effective december  for the combined plan  wpsc s cumulative contributions were less than cumulative accrued net benefit costs  therefore  no assets were recorded at december  prior to the merger  an asset was recognized for one of the plans 
see note to wps resources consolidated financial statements employee benefit plans  for more information 
the current portion of long term debt decreased from million at december   to at december  on january   wpsc retired early million of its series first mortgage bonds 
these bonds had an original maturity date of july  none of wpsc s long term debt is scheduled to mature in short term debt increased million  from million at december   to million at december  short term debt was used to finance a portion of wpsc s capital expenditures in accounts payable increased million  or  from december   to december  the increase in accounts payable was driven by expenditures for weston the environmental remediation liability increased million from december   to december  this liability relates to clean up costs associated with several manufactured gas plant sites see note to wps resources consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies  for more information 
wpsc s estimate of future clean up costs required to remediate these sites increased to reflect the wdnr s application of sediment guidance that was recently issued 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased million  or  from december   to december   primarily due to a reduction in the minimum pension liability that was recorded 
the decrease in the minimum pension liability was driven by wps resources merger of its two non contributory qualified retirement plans 
on a combined basis  the minimum pension liability and related pension asset were reduced pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles 
liquidity and capital resources wisconsin public service wpsc believes that its cash  operating cash flows  and borrowing ability because of strong credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  wpsc s operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside its control 
in addition  wpsc s borrowing costs can be impacted by its short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  which in part are based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
currently  wpsc believes these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry see the financing cash flows and credit ratings sections below 
operating cash flows during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the increase was driven by improved operating results 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to increased working capital requirements 
gas inventories increased million due to high natural gas prices 
receivables and accrued revenues also increased due to higher natural gas prices 
investing cash flows net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in the increase was largely related to a million increase in utility capital expenditures see capital expenditures below  partially offset by a million decrease in cash used for the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions 
the final payment in the amount of million related to the de pere energy center was made in december net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in the small decrease is attributed to a million decrease in capital expenditures and an increase in the sale of property  plant  and equipment of million 
the majority of the increase in the sale of property  plant  and equipment was the result of wpsc s sale of million of assets at book value related to the wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line to atc in june these factors were partially offset by an increase in the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions of million from the remaining purchase price for the megawatt de pere energy center paid in december see note acquisitions and sales of assets in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
capital expenditures capital expenditures by business segment for the years ended december    and are as follows millions years ended december  electric utility gas utility other wisconsin public service consolidated the increase in capital expenditures at the electric utility in as compared to is mainly due to higher capital expenditures associated with the construction of the megawatt coal fired weston generation facility located near wausau  wisconsin

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks and other significant risks wps resources has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk  interest rate risk  equity return  and principal preservation risk 
wps resources is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries business and the environment from which we operate 
wps resources has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures as further described below 
interest rate risk wps resources and wpsc are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from their variable rate long term debt and short term commercial paper borrowing 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
wps resources and wpsc enter into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
wps resources and wpsc may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
at december   and  wps resources utilized one interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on a variable rate loan at one of its nonregulated subsidiaries 
based on the variable rate debt of wps resources and wpsc outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points in would increase annual interest expense by approximately million at wps resources and million at wpsc 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense in by approximately million at wps resources and million at wpsc 
these amounts were determined by performing a sensitivity analysis on the impact of a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates on the variable rate debt of wps resources and wpsc outstanding as of december   and this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in the levels of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would take action to mitigate wps resources and wpsc s exposure to the change 
commodity price risk wps resources is exposed to commodity price risk resulting from the impact of market fluctuations in the price of certain commodities  including but not limited to electricity  natural gas  coal  fuel oil  and uranium  which are used and or sold by our subsidiaries in the normal course of their business 
we employ established policies and procedures and utilize contracts of various duration to manage our fuel and gas supply costs and to reduce the market risk associated with changing commodity prices  including using various types of commodity and derivative instruments 
wps resources exposure to commodity price risk in its regulated utilities is significantly mitigated by the current ratemaking process for the recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
recovery of electric fuel and purchased energy costs through the pscw ratemaking process can be sought if they exceed more than of the estimated costs used to establish the rates 
the risk associated with exposure to costs less than above the estimated costs that are not recoverable are not material 
recovery of utility natural gas commodity costs are allowed to be passed through to retail customers in both wisconsin and michigan via gas cost recovery plans authorized by the pscw and mpsc  respectively 
an additional risk within the ratemaking process  regulatory lag risk  occurs between the time we submit rate proceedings and the time we receive the final approval or denial from the pscw  mpsc  or ferc 
the regulatory lag risk may increase or decrease with any change in commodity prices  unplanned outages  or unscheduled maintenance during the approval period 
the regulatory lag risk is deemed to be insignificant  therefore  the value at risk amounts discussed below do not include measures for wps resources regulated utilities 
to further manage commodity price risk and the associated regulatory lag risk  our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
for the nonregulated utilities  pdi utilizes purchase and or sale contracts for electric fuel and electricity to help manage its commodity price risk and esi uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with the changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold at firm prices to customers 
esi also utilizes these instruments to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases 
for purposes of risk management disclosure  pdi and esi s activities are classified as non trading 
certain pdi merchant plants are under contract to esi and esi has the ability to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from these plants through the use of various financial and physical tools including forward contracts and options 
due to the fact that a majority of pdi s risk is now essentially managed and reported through esi  a separate value at risk amount has not been presented for pdi 
value at risk to measure commodity price risk exposure  wps resources performs a value at risk analysis of its exposures 
value at risk is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the value at risk amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
value at risk models are relatively sophisticated 
however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used 
value at risk is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
value at risk is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day  are normally distributed 
it does not take into account higher order risk exposures  so it may not provide a good approximation of the risk in a portfolio with substantial option positions 
we utilized a delta normal approximation because our portfolio has limited exposure to optionality 
our value at risk calculation includes derivative financial and commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options as well as commodities held in inventory  such as natural gas held in storage to the extent such positions are significant 
the value at risk amount for esi was calculated to be million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease is due to less volatility in the market and fewer unusual fluctuations in the various portfolios 
due to the fact that a majority of pdi s risk is essentially managed and reported through esi  a separate value at risk amount has not been presented for pdi in the value at risk amount for pdi at december  was calculated to be million 
for the year ended december   the average  high  and low value at risk amounts for esi were million  million  and million  respectively 
the same amounts for the year ended december   were million  million  and million 
the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the value at risk amounts at the beginning of the reporting period and the four quarter end amounts 
equity return and principal preservation risk wps resources and wpsc currently fund liabilities accumulated benefit obligations related to employee benefits and nuclear decommissioning through various external trust funds 
these funds are managed by various investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
wps resources maintains a qualified pension plan for employees retirement 
the liability accumulated benefit obligation of the qualified plan exceeded the value of the qualified plan s assets by million at december   and wps resources was  therefore  required to recognize a minimum pension liability as prescribed by sfas no 
declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future pension costs for the plan and possible future required contributions 
changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits or nuclear decommissioning could also impact future contributions 
wps resources monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
all decommissioning costs and most of the employee benefit costs relate to wps resources regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
foreign currency exchange rate risk wps resources is exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of foreign operations owned and operated in canada and transactions denominated in canadian dollars for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity by our nonregulated subsidiaries 
forward foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges are utilized to manage the risk associated with currency fluctuations on certain firm sales and sales commitments denominated in canadian dollars and certain canadian dollar denominated asset and liability positions 
wps resources exposure to foreign currency risk was not significant at december   or
