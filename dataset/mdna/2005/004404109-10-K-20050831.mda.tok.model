item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sources of revenue ace comm delivers enterprise telemanagement applications and advanced convergent mediation and operations support systems solutions to wireline and wireless voice  data  and internet communications providers 
our solutions typically consist of hardware  software and related services that enable the capture  security  validation  correlation  augmentation  and warehousing of data from network elements and the distribution of this data in appropriate formats to oss operations support systems and bss business support systems operations 
our solutions also provide for centralized management and security of enterprise networks 
after completing the purchase of the assets of intasys billing technologies in the quarter ending march   ace comm now offers intasys line of wireless oss products and has integrated the intasys technologies into our convergent mediation service delivery platform products 
we are now integrating newer versions of this software into our product line 
after completing the acquisition of helix during the quarter ending march   ace comm now offers the helix revenue assurance products included in operations support systems oss revenue 
we have also commenced integrating the helix technologies into our convergent mediation service delivery platform 
this past year we have introduced some new internally developed products and services  including convergent mediation sdp  a new software delivery platform which includes service implementation and control capabilities for voip  g  and ip data services 
ace comm derives revenues primarily from the sale of our products  including hardware and software  and related services 
ace comm enters into formal arrangements that provide for single or multiple deliverables of hardware  software and services 
these arrangements are formalized by either a simple purchase order or by more complex contracts such as development  reseller or master agreements 
these arrangements are generally us dollar denominated  but as we have increased the percentage of international sales these arrangements are also denominated in local currencies such as the british pound  and typically have an aggregate value of several thousand to several million dollars and vary in length from days to several years  as in the case of master agreements 
agreements spanning several years are normally implemented in smaller statements of work or orders that are typically deliverable within three to twelve months 
our customers  including resellers  do not possess the right of return or exchange 
revenue for a given period typically reflects products delivered or services performed during the period with respect to relatively large financial commitments from a small number of customers 
during  we had major customers generating  or more in revenue during the year representing approximately of total revenue 
our largest three customers during the year ended june   were siemens ag  northrop grumman and giza systems 
siemens ag contributed approximately of total revenues  northrop grumman contributed approximately of total revenues and giza systems contributed approximately of total revenues 
during  we had major customers that together represented of total revenues 
giza systems  our largest customer in fiscal year  represented approximately of total revenues  and siemens ag contributed approximately of total revenues 
during  we had major customers representing of total revenues 
siemens ag represented approximately of total revenues and northrop grumman contributed of total revenues earned during the average revenues earned per major customer were million in  million in  and million in trends and strategy revenue growth depends  in part  on the overall demand for our product based solutions and on sales to large customers 
because our sales are primarily to telecommunication and internet service providers and large enterprises  our ability to generate revenue also depends on specific conditions affecting those providers and on general economic conditions 
for the past several years we have been experiencing pressure on revenues from the prolonged downturn in demand in the telecommunications industry 
during the past three fiscal years  we experienced significant net losses from operations  primarily due to reduced demand from our north american telecommunications customers 
to offset the effects of the current lower north american demand  we continue to target sales efforts toward what we believe to be a growing market for our convergent mediation solutions outside of north america and to acquire revenues by expanding our customer base and product offerings through acquisition 
the acquisition of helix will increase revenues from europe and will allow us to expand our product offerings to all of our customers 
results for fiscal showed significant revenue and results of operations improvement in these areas excluding the one time charge for in process research and development 
we have been pursuing a growth strategy designed to expand our product line and areas of distribution to counteract reductions in demand for our traditional products and services 
the acquisition of i mobile and intasys during fiscal year and the acquisition of helix in march are consistent with this strategy 
we intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of additional complementary technologies to broaden our product line and increase our geographic scope 
we have also focused our sales resources on opportunities for our netplus eoss products to remedy reductions in demand from north america for convergent mediation solutions 
in addition to pursuing our traditional government markets  sales activities have been increased to large commercial enterprises to expand our netplus customer base 
we believe our recent contract award from the us air force resulted in part from these efforts 
we have experienced a reduction in the number of potential customers for our oss products and services and a reduction in our existing customer base in the uk as a result of consolidation within the uk service provider market by network providers 
our largest customer in this group has given notice that they will be terminating their service contract with us in the first half of fiscal this customer accounted for of our consolidated revenues in fiscal as a result of previous losses  we have maintained numerous cost reduction measures which have kept operating expenses low 
additionally  we have contingency plans to reduce expenses further  should revenues decline below projected levels 
during the most recent fiscal year we have built a significant contract backlog  up to million at june  we expect to have increased costs and liquidity demands during the current fiscal year as we devote significant effort during the current fiscal year to delivering products and services and supporting our customers under these contracts 
recent developments helix on march   we completed the acquisition of double helix solutions limited  a company based in london that operates under the name helix  a provider of network asset assurance  revenue optimization  and business intelligence solutions to tier carriers  primarily in the european sector 
the total purchase price for the acquisition was million  or approximately million  plus possible additional consideration under an earn out equal to the excess of helix revenues over million during the months commencing in march the purchase price consisted of  shares of ace comm common stock valued at a per share price of  the day volume weighted average price of ace comm common stock  and notes payable with a six month maturity in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million 
in accordance with fas  we allocated the purchase price based on an economic valuation of the purchased assets 
based upon this valuation  we recorded an intangible asset of million which will be amortized over thirty six months related to the purchased customers and technology of helix 
additionally  we recorded a charge of million in the third quarter of associated with the purchase of in process research and development 
helix has several software tools that are being developed into software products that we intend to complete and sell either as stand alone or integrated into our convergent mediation service delivery platform  as discussed more fully in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
private placement on march   we completed a private placement of  units at per unit  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to ace comm of  each unit sold in the private placement consisted of one share of ace comm s common stock and a warrant to acquire shares of ace comm common stock at an exercise price of per share 
together with each unit we granted an additional investment right to acquire one share of ace comm common stock at an exercise price of per share and a warrant to acquire shares of ace comm common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the closing price of ace comm s common stock on march  was 
the company has an obligation to register these shares and the registration is currently in process 
department of defense contract in april  we were selected to provide our netplus telecommunications system to the air force for a global deployment 
these programs will encompass hundreds of installations  and are expected to total in excess of million for us over their lifespan 
they include initial deployments scheduled over an month timeframe  follow on contracts for life cycle support and maintenance  further opportunities for ongoing upgrades and improvements  and additional sales opportunities for future versions of netplus eoss and possibly new products recently acquired as a part of helix 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonably based upon information available to us at the time that the estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations or require the application of significant estimates  judgment or assumptions by our management 
the following is a brief discussion of these critical accounting policies revenue recognition ace comm derives revenues primarily from products  where a combination of hardware  proprietary licensed software  and services are offered to customers 
these products are typically formalized in a multiple element arrangement involving application of existing software capabilities or modification of the underlying software  implementation and support services 
our software licenses to end users generally provide for an initial license fee to use the product in perpetuity 
subscription revenue  included in operational support systems revenue  is recognized on a monthly basis based upon the number of telephone subscribers of our customers 
we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles 
ace comm follows specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments and current interpretations of rules and guidelines affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is considered probable under applicable accounting tests 
one of the critical judgments we make is our assessment of the probability of collecting the related accounts receivable balance on a customer by customer basis 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
in cases where collectibility is not deemed probable  revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash  assuming all other criteria have been met 
we are also required to exercise judgment in determining whether the fixed and determinable fee criteria have been met by evaluating the risk of our granting a concession to our customers  particularly when payments terms are beyond our normal credit period of sixty to ninety days 
in addition  when our contracts contain customer acceptance provisions  management assesses whether uncertainty exists about such acceptance in determining when to record revenue 
for multiple element arrangements that include software products  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  which is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether sufficient evidence exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
in situations when our products involve significant modification or customization of software  or when our systems integration and services are essential to the functionality of the software  revenues relating to the software licenses and services are aggregated and the combined revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
the hardware revenue on these contracts is recognized upon transfer of title  which generally occurs at the same time the licensed software is delivered 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is based on the estimated stage of completion of individual contracts determined on a cost or level of efforts basis 
approximately of our fiscal revenue was derived from contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
when our contracts contain extended payment terms  we defer recognition of revenue until amounts become due pursuant to payment schedules and no other uncertainties exist 
we correspondingly defer a proportionate amount of contract cost which will be matched against the deferred revenue when recognized 
should management make the determination that previously deferred revenue will not be recognized  the corresponding amount of deferred contract cost will be charged to expense at that time 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is an estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  individually and in aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
our customer base is highly concentrated in the telecommunications and internet service provider industries 
several of the leading companies in these industries have filed for bankruptcy 
in addition  we have experienced delays in receiving payment from certain of our international customers and certain of these customers have negotiated longer payment terms 
if collection is not probable at the time the transaction is consummated  we do not recognize revenue until cash collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when indicators of impairment exist  the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if impairment has occurred 
if such assets are deemed impaired  an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized 
if quoted market prices for the assets are not available  the fair value is calculated using the present value of estimated net cash flows 
we did not record an impairment charge during the years ended june  and results of operations the following sets forth selected consolidated data as a percentage of revenue for each of the following years ended june years ended june  revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue selling  general and administrative research and development in process research and development loss from operations net interest expense gain from settlement of debt obligation loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss we purchased the oss assets of intasys in february accordingly the results of intasys s oss revenues are included in our results of operations since the acquisition date 
previous periods do not include the revenue of intasys 
we purchased helix in march accordingly  approximately three months of the results of helix revenues are included in our results of operations for the twelve months ended june  revenues the following summarizes our revenue in thousands years ended june  revenue licenses and hardware services total revenue total revenues in were million compared to million in and million in total revenues increased million or in and decreased million or in  as compared to the prior year 
license and hardware revenue increased by million to million for the year ended june  when compared to fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the revenues from two new customers in asia and one new customer in the middle east of million and million from the air force offset by a million decrease from a customer in the middle east 
license and hardware revenue decreased million in fiscal when compared to fiscal this decline was primarily the result of a reduction in order levels from three existing customers of approximately million in total 
services revenue increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the majority of this increase was principally the result of the inclusion of the revenues from the assets purchased from intasys for all of fiscal and the revenues from the acquisition of helix for the last quarter of fiscal  which aggregated million 
services revenue increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in revenue was principally the result of the inclusion of the revenues from the asset purchase from intasys of million for the last five months of fiscal and an increase in maintenance revenues of million  offset by a decrease in customization and implementation services of million 
revenue from sales to network service providers increased from million to million for fiscal year and represented of total revenue 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in revenues in asia and the middle east of million generated from three new customers  offset by a decline in revenues from one customer in the middle east of million as its large multi year contract is completing 
revenue from sales to enterprises increased from million to million during fiscal year  and represented approximately of total revenue 
revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in purchases from one of our primary customers us army of million and revenues of million from a large contract award from the air force 
revenue from sales of operations support systems solutions increased from million to million during fiscal year and represents of total revenue 
these revenues are derived principally from our new product line purchased from intasys in february and the acquisition of helix in march periods prior to march   did not include the revenue of the operations support systems products 
the increases in revenue are the result of the inclusion of the assets purchased from intasys for a full year 
backlog was million  as of june   compared to million as of june  we define backlog as future revenue from signed contracts or purchase orders for delivery of hardware and software products and services to be provided to customers generally within one year 
in addition  we include in backlog amounts related to delivered products where revenue has been deferred 
the increase in includes the backlog for our air force contract of million 
we estimate that million of the backlog at june   will be recognized during fiscal year although we believe that our entire backlog consists of firm orders  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual revenue for any future period because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules and delays inherent in the contracting process 
we believe revenues will increase in fiscal as a result of the significant increase in our backlog and on going sales activities  assuming we can deliver during fiscal the portion of the backlog that we anticipate delivering 
at this time we cannot predict the amount of the increase or whether the increase in revenues will enable us to make a profit during fiscal cost of revenues our cost of revenue consists primarily of direct labor costs  direct material costs  and allocable indirect costs 
the expenses for services provided by certain alliance partners in connection with the installation and integration of our products may also be included 
cost of revenues has fixed and variable components and includes expenses that are directly related to the generation of operating revenues 
several cost categories are specifically identifiable as relating to products versus services including material costs and direct labor charged to a product job 
in many instances  certain expenses related to infrastructure and personnel are often utilized to generate revenues from the various product and service categories  making it difficult to determine cost of revenue by product 
commencing with costs incurred in  we developed a methodology for segregating the product and service components of cost of revenues 
costs directly related to hardware or software that are identifiable by cost type  such as materials  freight  direct labor and travel charges were assigned to cost of licenses and hardware 
other charges including warranty  maintenance and re work costs were allocated based upon warranty incident reports 
employee benefits are allocated based on total burden rate and other overhead costs are allocated on a pro rata basis 
our method of allocating these costs may not be comparable to approaches of other companies 
use of a different method of allocation could change the costs of revenues and margin associated with products and services 
our overall cost of revenue and gross margin is not affected by this allocation method 
cost of revenues were million in  million in and million in  representing  and of revenues  respectively 
the decrease in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenues in resulted primarily from the million increase in revenues  increases in margins on the increases in revenues  and continued cost containment efforts 
cost of licenses and hardware revenue was million in  million in  and million in  representing   and  of licenses and hardware revenue  respectively 
the percentages of revenues are consistent in and and the increase in was due to higher materials costs associated with hardware revenue and fixed costs being spread over lower revenues 
cost of services revenue was million in  million in  and million in  representing   and of services revenue for those years 
costs of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue have decreased due to the additional services revenue of million resulting from the acquisition of the assets of intasys and helix 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of costs to support our sales and administrative functions 
sales expenses consist primarily of salary  commission  travel  trade show  bid and proposal  and other related selling and marketing expenses required to sell our products to target markets 
general and administrative expenses consist of provision for doubtful accounts and unallocated costs related to our information systems infrastructure  facilities  finance and accounting  legal  human resources and corporate management 
sg a expenses were million in  million in  and million in  representing   and of total revenues in each year  respectively 
sg a expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue during this past year because revenues increased significantly while our cost base remained relatively fixed 
sg a increased million or in  increased million or in  and decreased million or in  as compared to each prior corresponding period 
the increase in includes an increase of million due to including twelve months versus months of the costs associated with the acquisition of assets from intasys and the acquisition of helix offset by a decrease of million in the provision for doubtful accounts expense 
the increase in results from the additional sg a costs associated with the acquisition of assets from intasys of million  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and an increase in selling expenses for our existing product lines 
the decrease in is primarily the result of a continuing effort to reduce expenses  which includes company and employee initiated reductions in personnel  and reductions in rent  travel  consulting and professional fees 
we recognized a net provision for doubtful accounts of million in compared to a net provision for doubtful accounts of million in and million in  representing a decrease of million in and an increase of million in as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
during  two of our customers experienced a significant adverse change in their financial conditions  leading us to reserve fully against the receivable from these customers 
in the other years our reserve was based on an analysis of our customers and their payment history 
existing or future customers ability to pay us may be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions or by other factors 
during the past several years the company has initiated numerous cost reduction measures which have affected our employees  including their compensation 
to promote employee retention  we accelerated  previously unvested employee stock options effective in june while such options were out of the money  management believes the acceleration will provide flexibility and therefore possible value to these employees in the future 
under current accounting guidance  no compensation expense was recorded in our financial statements 
however  we reported in note  stock based compensation  pro forma compensation expense of  associated with the accelerated options 
had we not accelerated the vesting of these options  compensation expense of   and  would have been recorded in the income statement upon the required adoption of sfas r for fiscal years   and  respectively 
an additional  employee stock options were not accelerated as of fiscal year end  of which  were held by executive officers of the company 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses consist of personnel costs and the associated infrastructure costs required to support the design and development of our products such as jbill global and netplus and our convergent mediation service delivery platform 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in research and development expenses increased million or in  million or in and decreased 
million or in  as compared to each prior corresponding period 
research and development expenses represented of revenues in  of revenues in  and of revenues in the substantial increase in research and development in and results from completing much of the in process research and development that existed when we acquired the assets of intasys and increased research and development associated with our convergent mediation service delivery platform 
these expenses are expected to continue at or above the current levels for the fiscal year as we develop the helix products and make the technical changes necessary to integrate the new products into our product lines  expand development of ace comm products and complete the final development of new versions of the intasys products 
although research and development expenses have increased and are expected to continue at or above the current level  we are pursuing several strategies to control costs in this area 
we have been selective in approving new projects and in some instances discontinued projects that were not related to the development of convergent mediation tm solutions 
we are also evaluating alternative development opportunities such as outsourcing to continue to manage our expenses 
in instances where we charge our customers for custom development we include the costs associated with the development in the cost of revenues 
finally  we have been pursuing opportunities to license or acquire market ready new technology from third parties as part of our strategy for expanding our product offerings 
we expensed million for acquired in process research and development associated with the helix acquisition during the most recent fiscal year 
helix has several software tools that are being developed into software products that we intend to complete and sell either as stand alone or integrated into our convergent mediation service delivery platform  as discussed more fully in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
that note also includes a discussion of the intasys in process research and development 
liquidity and capital resources asset and cash flow analysis at june  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash and cash equivalents were million at june  and million at june  the cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by  or  in and increased by million or in  in each case as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
in we acquired million of cash from i mobile  offset by the operating loss for the year and by the purchase of assets of intasys for million 
cash and cash equivalents were of total assets at june  compared to at june  the percentage decrease results from the increase in other assets including goodwill of million and acquired intangibles of million 
our cashflow is dependent upon numerous factors  including the timing of customer orders and engagements  and related obligations and payments  market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of changes in the size of our operations and other factors 
working capital was million at june   million at june  and million at june  working capital decreased million or in  decreased million  or  in  and decreased million  or in  in each case as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
the decrease in working capital in is due to an increase in borrowings which includes notes payable related to the acquisition of helix of million and an increase in our line of credit of million  and an increase in current liabilities of million primarily as a result of the helix acquisition costs and an increase in accounts payable 
gross accounts receivables increased  or at june  and decreased  or at june  as of june  compared to the same date in  gross receivables as a percentage of revenues decreased from to as a result of an increase in revenues and better collection experience 
five customers represented of our gross trade receivables balance as of june   with one international customer representing of our gross trade receivables balance as of june  our operating activities used million in cash during  million in cash during and million in cash during the changes between years in cash flows from operating activities are principally due to changes in net income loss after adjustments for non cash charges such as depreciation and in process research and development costs acquired and due to changes in working capital amounts 
changes in accounts receivable balances are typically the most significant component of working capital and fluctuate as a result of the timing and volume of our revenues and other factors 
net cash used for investing activities was million in  million in due to the purchase of assets of intasys for million and cash used for investing activities was million in financing activities generated cash of million in  million in  and million in the cash generated in is primarily from the private financing on march   net of expenses  and from borrowings under our bank line offset by payment of notes related to the helix acquisition of million 
the cash generated results primarily from the i mobile transaction  which generated cash of million 
cost containment program although revenues increased in fiscal  we have continued our cost containment measures which we implemented in and to a lesser extent in as a result of significant net losses from operations 
we have maintained or reduced the number of full time employees during the past three fiscal years  excluding employees of intasys and helix 
we expect to have increased costs and liquidity demands during the current fiscal year as we devote significant effort during the current fiscal year to delivering products and services and supporting our customers under the contracts resulting in our large backlog at june  contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  and the effect these commitments could have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
contractual obligation payments due by period amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years operating leases other commitments total commitments we have commercial commitments of an accounts receivable backed line of credit effective december  which expires and is subject to renewal on november  the outstanding balance at june  was million 
we also have issued standby letters of credit for security deposits for office space and to guarantee service contracts as summarized in the following table 
the standby letters of credit have a one year term and renew annually 
other commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period amounts in thousands total amounts less than over committed year years years years standby letters of credit line of credit we have an amended and restated loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank effective december  which expires and is subject to renewal on november  under this agreement  we may borrow based upon the amount of its approved borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable  up to a maximum of million 
the line of credit has sub limits of  for letters of credit and million for us export import bank usage 
we can draw up to of our eligible accounts receivable under the master line and of our eligible foreign accounts receivable under the us export import bank sub limit line 
amounts borrowed bear interest at a rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus per annum  charged on the average daily balance of advances outstanding  payable monthly and calculated on a day year basis 
we also pay certain costs and expenses of the bank in administering the line 
the receivables comprising the borrowing base must not be more than days aged  must not be in dispute  and must conform to other eligibility requirements 
the agreement has a monthly quick ratio covenant which must be complied with on an intra quarterly basis  and a minimum tangible net worth covenant which must be complied with on a quarterly basis 
the agreement also subjects the company to non financial covenants  including restrictions over dividends 
for the months ending april  and may   we were not in compliance with the intra quarterly quick ratio covenant 
the bank agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the existing loan documents via a forbearance agreement dated june  as of june   ace comm was in compliance with its covenants 
ace comm s obligation under the agreement are secured by a security interest in all of our assets and intellectual property 
advances made to ace comm are payable in full upon demand in the event of default under the agreement 
as of june   there were outstanding borrowings of million and million was available under the line of credit 
under the terms of our corporate headquarters office lease  we maintain a letter of credit under our line of credit with our bank  which names the landlord as the sole beneficiary and which may be drawn on by the landlord in the event of a monetary default by us under the lease 
the letter of credit required under the lease for fiscal year is  and will decrease annually through fiscal year we also maintain other customer related letters of credit issued by the bank and secured under our line of credit to support specific terms and conditions of customer orders 
the aggregate of these customer related letters of credit total approximately  at june  liquidity analysis at june  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million was available under the line of credit 
we expect to have increased costs and liquidity demands during the current fiscal year as we devote significant effort during the current fiscal year to delivering products and services and supporting our customers under the contracts resulting in our large backlog at june  we are continuing to manage our expenses to conserve cash and maintain adequate liquidity 
we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures at june  we believe that existing consolidated cash balances reflecting the private financing  cash flows from operations  receipt of new contracts  and the availability of credit under our agreement with the bank will support our working capital requirements for the next twelve months  based on our current expectations as to anticipated revenue  expenses and cash flow 
the company is still pursuing a growth strategy that involves acquisitions and additional financing likely would be required for future acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to any borrowings under our line of credit 
as of june   borrowings outstanding under our line of credit was approximately million 
our market risk sensitive instruments do not expose us to material market risk exposures 
should interest rates increase or decrease  interest expense would increase or decrease  based on our borrowings as of june
