competition we compete for consumer packaged goods and pharmaceutical manufacturer advertising and consumer promotion budgets with a wide range of alternative media  including television  radio  print and direct mail advertising  as well as several alternative in store and point of sale programs 
our business segments compete with various traditional coupon delivery methods including free standing inserts  newspapers  direct mail  magazines and in or on product packaging  as well as other in store marketing companies that use a variety of coupon  promotion or other advertising delivery methods 
we could experience increased competition from changes and advances in technology 
furthermore  as sales of certain grocery products  particularly in certain specialized consumer product categories  shift from traditional grocery retailers to mass merchandisers and value chains and other retail channels  our ability to reach shoppers through our existing retail network of traditional grocery stores and pharmacies may be impacted in certain consumer product categories 
we compete for advertising and promotional dollars based on the efficiencies afforded by a unique kind of targeting based on consumer shopping behavior  called behavior based marketing 
our method of behavior based marketing requires an efficient network of retail point of sale systems and proprietary software and database systems which target individual consumers based on shopping behavior exhibited at the point of sale 
our competitive advantages in the practice of behavior based marketing are achieved through the number of shoppers reached through our networks  the number of household ids and associated purchase histories available in the database and our ability to deliver consumer insights and influence consumer buying behavior 
research and development our research and development efforts are generally for pilot project execution to create  test and support new applications for the catalina marketing network and health resource network  market research  software development and system upgrades 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  expenditures for research and development were million  million and million  respectively 
intellectual property we currently hold  and have applications pending for  numerous united states and foreign patents relating to our products and services 
these patents include certain remaining targeted incentive patents as well as improvements and additional inventions related to our current and contemplated business  programs and services 
in addition  we regard certain computer software utilized by the 
table of contents company as proprietary and subject to copyright protection 
we also hold  and have pending  numerous service marks and trademarks related to our entities  businesses  products and services that have associated goodwill in the relevant marketplace 
we believe that certain intellectual property owned or licensed by us gives us a competitive advantage in certain geographic regions in which we operate 
while we continue to pursue protection for intellectual property rights that we have developed  certain of our patents  over time  have and will expire and there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional patent rights 
the expiration of a patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge may result in significant competition from third parties with respect to the covered product or service in a short period of time 
the actual protection afforded by a patent  which can vary from country to country  depends upon the type of patent  the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the relevant country 
although we believe that our intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage  we believe that we are not dependent upon a single patent  or a specific series of patents  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in appropriate situations  we seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights vigorously 
government regulation our operations are subject to regulation in the united states and in other countries in which we do business 
we are subject to federal and state laws governing privacy and the use of consumer information collected by us 
in the united states  various federal agencies including the federal trade commission  the department of treasury s alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau and various state agencies have promulgated regulations that restrict the advertising of tobacco  dairy and alcohol beverage products 
these regulations vary from state to state and can restrict a manufacturer and or a retailer s ability to issue coupons for tobacco  dairy and alcohol beverage products 
other state and federal laws also restrict the content and sponsorship of regulated product coupons and messages 
chr operates in a highly regulated business environment 
the united states food and drug administration of the department of health and human services hhs regulates the form and content of prescription drug promotions  such as the messaging distributed in patientlink 
in addition  federal privacy regulations  administered by the office of civil rights of hhs  affect the ability of chr and its retail pharmacy partners to use patient specific pharmacy information to provide customized patientlink prints 
some states have adopted  or are considering adopting  state medical privacy requirements that could be interpreted more stringently than federal medical privacy requirements 
federal antikickback requirements  administered by the hhs office of the inspector general  could be interpreted as restricting drug manufacturer sponsored programs such as patientlink 
state antikickback and consumer protection statutes could also be interpreted to impose similar restrictions
