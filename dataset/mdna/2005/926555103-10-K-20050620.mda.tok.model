item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacture and distribution of a wide range of display devices  encompassing  among others  entertainment  military  medical and simulation display solutions 
the company is comprised of two segments the manufacture and distribution of monitors  projection systems and crt displays and the wholesale distribution of consumer electronic parts 
the display segment is organized into four interrelated operations aggregated into one operating segment pursuant to the aggregation criteria of sfas monitors offers a complete range of crt  flat panel and projection display systems for use in training and simulation  military  medical and industrial applications 
data display offers a complete range of crts for use in data display screens  including computer terminal monitors and medical monitoring equipment 
home entertainment offers a complete range of crts and projection tubes for television and home theater equipment 
components provides replacement electron guns and other components for crts primarily for servicing the company s internal needs 
fiscal highlights monitor revenue the company s monitor continued a strong growth trend 
the company continues to compete in various niche markets within the defense  medical and projection display industries 
net sales in monitors increased in fiscal by  or compared to fiscal management attributes this to increased demand within the defense sector  as well as its third quarter acquisition of certain assets of evans sutherland  inc which now gives the company the ability to compete in the commercial flight training and simulation market 
data display revenue the company s data display revenues increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal these increases reflect the company s sales of projection tubes from its data display location in tucker  ga  which carry a higher unit price than its normal inventory 
purchase of assets in october  the company finalized the purchase of certain inventories  fixed assets  and various other intangible assets of evans sutherland  inc following that agreement  the company consolidated all manufacturing  sales and support with its established marquee projector operations in cape canaveral  florida 
this consolidation process was complete by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter 
new credit facility in november   the company finalized a new line of credit to replace its prior credit facility 
under the terms of this new facility  the bank paid off the existing line of credit  as well as the term note collateralized by the assets of aydin  inc  a note due to an officer of the company and the loan from the chief executive officer used to finance the purchase of the evans sutherland  inc assets 
the maximum amount available for borrowings under this new line is  compared to  under the prior facility 
proceeds from this line are available for working capital needs of the company and are subject to various covenants 
as of february   the company was in compliance with all loan covenants 
fiscal challenges inventory management the company continually monitors historical sales trends as well as projected future needs to ensure adequate on hand supplies of inventory and to ensure against overstocking of slower moving  obsolete items 
certain of the company s divisions maintain significant inventories of crts and component parts in an effort to ensure its customers a reliable source of supply 
this level of inventory is higher than some of the company s competitors due to the fact that it sells a number of products representing older  or trailing edge  technology that may not be available from other sources 
the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining and  as manufacturers for these products discontinue production or exit the business  the company may make last time buys 
in the monitor portion of the company s business  the market for its products is characterized by fairly rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the flat panel display area 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers and accurately forecast their requirements  it may accumulate inventories of products which its customers no longer need and which the company will be unable to sell or return to its vendors 
the wholesale distribution segment also maintains in inventory a broad range of products which contributes to a higher total inventory in order to be able to promptly provide those customers who are buying products  or obtaining warranty replacements  for electronic part components 
in fiscal and  the company recorded consolidated provisions of approximately million and million  respectively  for obsolescence and overstock 
operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages which selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues see item business description of principal business and principal products for discussion about the company s products and divisions

the display segment increased  or while the wholesale parts segment increased  or for the comparative periods 
the net increase in display segment sales in fiscal is attributed to continued growth in monitor revenues of  as well as increases within the data display revenues of  compared to the prior fiscal year 
there were offsetting declines within the home entertainment and component parts revenues of  and  respectively 
increases in monitor revenues reflect new contracts with boeing co  lockheed martin  and others  which began in fiscal specifically  display systems and aydin displays posted increases of  and  respectively compared to fiscal there were offsetting declines of  at lexel during the year due to the fact that lexel completed one of its major contracts during fiscal lexel s other product lines  however  maintained backlogs of  at february  increases in data display revenues are attributed primarily to management s decision in late fiscal to distribute commercial and military projection tube displays from its data display location in tucker  georgia 
these projection tube displays carry a higher price per unit than its normal inventory 
within the entertainment division  sales declined  compared to fiscal there were declines of  at the novatron location  which is a result of management s decision in late fiscal to distribute projection tube displays from its data display location  which is a part of the data display division 
the magnaview location showed decreases of  compared to last fiscal year 
management closed this location in january and merged its operations with its chroma location in white mills  pa as of february  the chroma location showed decreases of  compared to fiscal  which is a result of weaker demand in the television tube replacement market 
the company is the primary supplier of replacement television crts to the domestic entertainment market 
a majority of the entertainment division s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets to  fewer extended warranties were sold by retailers  a trend consistent with the past two fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of product to meet manufacturers standard warranties 
growth in this division will be negatively impacted by the decreasing number of extended warranties sold for the larger  more expensive sets 
sales of component parts declined  compared to the fiscal year ended february  sales of these parts have declined over the past two fiscal years due to weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales 
electron gun sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined over the past few years as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
the company s wintron location is in the process of transitioning to two newer camera technologies 
one such technology will assist border guards with under car inspections and another will assist correctional facilities with the supervision of inmates 
if successful  the company believes these new technologies will have a positive impact on the component division sales 
within the wholesale parts segments  sales were positively impacted by the addition of a new call center in fiscal this call center added approximately  in new sales for the fiscal year  which was offset by declines in other areas of that segment s business of  gross margins consolidated gross profit margins remained unchanged at for the year ended february  as compared to the fiscal year ended february  display margins decreased slightly to from and the wholesale electronic parts margins remained relatively unchanged at for the year ended february  as compared to at february  within the display segment  data display gross margins decreased from at february  to at february  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management decided to increase its reserve for inventory obsolescence within this division 
excluding the effects of this adjustment  gross margins for data display would ve been for the year ended february   which reflects the positive impact of management s decision to distribute higher margin projection tubes from its data display location in tucker  ga 
gross margins in home entertainment crts decreased from at february  to at february  this reflects lower sales volume for the comparable periods 
revenues decreased  for the comparable periods 
in monitors projectors  gross margins increased from to for the comparable periods 
this increase is attributable to increases in revenues of  revenues increased without a corresponding increase in costs by improving production efficiency as fixed costs were absorbed by greater production 
gross margins from component parts sold decreased from to for the comparable periods 
this decrease was due to decreases in sales within this division of  for the comparable periods 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales remained flat at for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  display segment operating expenses increased  while operating expenses for the consumer parts distribution segment increased  within the display segment  most of this increase was posted within the monitor operations as increased growth has required additional administrative support 
the company s cape canaveral operations have added people during the fiscal year ended february  within the consumer parts distribution segment  these increases reflect additional labor and overhead associated with its new call center that was opened in fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased  for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
libor and prime rates were slightly lower during the comparable periods 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales increased  for fiscal or less than over fiscal net sales 
the display segment increased  or while the wholesale parts segment sales decreased  or for the comparative periods 
the net increase in display segment sales in fiscal is attributed to growth in revenues from monitors and projectors sales of  this increase is attributed in large part to stronger demand from military and defense contractors 
offsetting declines occurred in net sales of the data display  entertainment  and component parts divisions of   and  respectively 
the net gain in monitor and projector sales includes increases from display systems of  aydin displays of  and xkd of  cockpit displays 
these increases reflect revenues from new contract orders received from the boeing co  lockheed martin and others during fiscal there were offsetting declines during the fiscal year of  at the lexel operation 
one of its major contracts was completed during fiscal  though lexel s other product lines  including direct view storage tubes  maintained backlogs of  at february  the other offsetting declines were the result of the company s decision to close two locations  megascan and wolcott  in fiscal these two locations provided net sales of  and  during the fiscal year 
management attributes the overall increase within this segment to increased demand within the defense sector 
revenue on new government orders was  for the fiscal year 
declines in the data display revenues of  for fiscal compared to continue to reflect the continued sluggish replacement market for crts 
these declines are due to decreased unit sales in fiscal and not to the loss of any particular customers 
these declines are also a reflection of customer decisions to purchase new monitors with updated products and technologies instead of repairing older monitors 
the company reduced bulk purchases of last time buys of crts in an effort to lower the company s exposure to potential future declines in demand 
component parts revenue declined by  for the fiscal year ended as compared to a year ago 
electron gun and stem sales were negatively impacted by weaker demand during the fiscal year  while the company s wintron location was negatively impacted as they transition to newer technologies 
electron gun sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
net revenues from projection tube crts decreased  while declines in sales of replacement television crts totaled  for the year ended february  as compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year 
the company is the primary supplier of replacement television crts to the domestic entertainment market 
a majority of the entertainment crt sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets to  fewer extended warranties are sold by retailers  a trend consistent with the two previous fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of the manufacturer s standard warranties 
growth in home entertainment crt sales is expected to be impacted by the timing and number of extended warranties sold for the larger  more expensive sets 
due to the fact that the company is in the replacement market  it has the ability to track retail sales trends and  accordingly  can attempt to adjust quantities of certain size crts carried in stock and reduce the exposure to obsolescence 
in fiscal  retail trends continued to indicate increased sales in the mid to larger size television sets 
flat panel technology has not had a significant impact on the television replacement market 
most of the flat panel units sold within the television market are for commercial usage rather than end user consumer usage 
within the data display and monitor divisions  there has been an impact by flat panel technology 
the company has converted manufacturing of certain subsidiaries within these divisions to produce flat panel products 
the company s xkd and aydin subsidiaries flat panel sales for fiscal comprised approximately and of their total net sales  respectively 
the decrease in the wholesale consumer parts segment net sales of  is attributed primarily to the declines in sales under the distribution sales agreements of parts and accessories for applica and norelco product lines 
these declines were attributed primarily to the sluggish market for original consumer electronic parts  which also negatively impacted repair and warranty sales of this segment 
gross margins consolidated gross profit margins increased to from for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  display segment margins increased from to and the wholesale electronic parts segment margins decreased from to 
display segment margins were impacted by a variety of factors 
the company s monitor sales increased while cost of sales increased 
an increase of high volume orders in versus helped keep costs down by improving production efficiency as fixed costs were absorbed by greater throughput 
to a lesser extent  data display sales experienced higher margins due to the company s ability to purchase crts from cheaper outside sources  as opposed to manufacturing these products at the former mexico subsidiary 
purchases from these outside sources average approximately per crt as opposed to per crt from the former mexico subsidiary 
fiscal included write downs and write offs of inventories and manufacturing equipment of  related to the closing of operations of mexico  wolcott  megascan  and aydin uk locations 
excluding the effects of these adjustments  display segment margins would have been for fiscal additionally  several crt locations with higher volume  particularly aydin  display systems and xkd  were able to achieve these increases without adding comparable fixed overhead and as such their margins were generally improved 
the decrease in the wholesale consumer parts segment margins is largely attributable to the overall decrease in sales related to the applica and norelco distribution agreements 
the revenues associated with these agreements include primarily handling charges and shipping income  which accounts for an approximately profit margin before the effects of offsetting operating expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from for the year ended february  to for the year ended february  included in operating expenses for fiscal were write offs of accounts receivable and other assets in the amount of  related to the mexico manufacturing location that was shut down 
a non cash charge of  was also recognized in fiscal for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment to reflect the impairment of the company s investment in the mexican subsidiary 
excluding the effects of these adjustments  operating expenses as a percentage of sales would have been for fiscal excluding the above adjustments  display segment expenses decreased  and wholesale parts segment expenses increased  the closure of the three facilities  relocation of the aydin facility and other cost cutting programs implemented in late fiscal resulted in the decreased crt expense 
specifically  the closure of the wolcott  megascan and mexico operations resulted in savings of   and  of operating costs  respectively 
the savings are due to a reduction of compensation expense caused by the decrease in personnel and a reduction in overhead caused by the closures of these facilities in the prior year 
increases to the wholesale parts segment include increases to warehouse rent and labor of approximately  as well as corporate expenses totaling  allocated during fiscal that were not allocated previously 
interest expense interest expense decreased  for the year ended february  as compared to february  the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
libor and prime rates were slightly lower during the comparable periods 
overall debt decreased during the comparative periods by  which was the primary reason for the decrease in interest expense 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the effective tax rate for was lower than the federal statutory rate due to differences between income tax and financial reporting purposes relating primarily to the effect of state income taxes and the non deductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes 
management s discussion of liquidity and capital resources at february  and february   the company had total cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
the company s working capital was  and  at february  and february   respectively 
in recent years  the company has financed its growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations  borrowings under revolving credit facilities and long term debt 
the company specializes in certain products representing trailing edge technology that may not be available from other sources  and may not be currently manufactured 
in many instances  the company s products are components of larger display systems for which immediate availability is critical for the customer 
accordingly  the company enjoys higher gross margins  but typically has larger investments in inventories than those of its competitors 
the company continually monitors its cash and financing positions in order to find ways to lower its interest costs and to produce positive operating cash flow 
the company examines possibilities to grow its business as opportunities present themselves  such as new sales contracts or niche acquisitions 
there could be an impact on working capital requirements to fund this growth 
as in the past  the intent is to finance such projects with operating cash flows or existing bank lines  however  more permanent sources of capital may be required in certain circumstances 
in march  the company signed an agreement in principle to acquire the assets of colorado based data ray corporation s crt monitor operations 
the asset purchase included the issuance of the company s common stock and cash to the seller of  total consideration

compared to prior years  inventory turnover has remained flat and the company has reduced its bulk purchases of last time buys of crts as it anticipates future reduced demand for these products in the replacement market 
working capital requirements increased  in due primarily to purchase requirements within the monitor divisions related to contracts that began in the fourth quarter of that year   and to reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  from cash generated from earnings  offset somewhat by reductions in accounts receivable of  due to better collection efforts within the data display and monitor divisions 
the average days outstanding for accounts receivable decreased from days in fiscal to days in fiscal  due to more aggressive collection efforts

the maximum amount available for borrowings under this new line is  compared to  under the prior facility 
proceeds from this line are available for working capital needs of the company and are subject to various covenants

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount 
management attempts to determine by historical usage analysis and interchangeability of crt types along with repair contracts currently maintained by its customers  as well as numerous other market factors  the projected demand for crts in this estimate of net realizable value 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management reviews inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
such reviews include observations of product development trends of the oem s  new products being marketed  and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the company s existing inventories 
there have been no significant changes in management s estimates in fiscal and  however  the company cannot guarantee the accuracy of future forecasts since these estimates are subject to change based on market conditions 
in fiscal  the company wrote off approximately  of inventory 
the company wrote off approximately  of inventory in fiscal related to changing market conditions affecting primarily its southwest vacuum and fox international businesses 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately  and  at february  and february   respectively 
amounts written off in  and were   and  respectively 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on the sale of products when the products are shipped  all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the company s delivery term typically is fob shipping point 
in accordance with eitf  shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs incurred are classified in selling and delivery in the consolidated statements of operations 
a portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture crts to a buyers specification 
these contracts are accounted for under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
these contracts are fixed price and cost plus contracts and are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the wholesale parts segment has several distribution agreements that it accounts for using the gross revenue basis as prescribed by eitf the company uses the gross method because the company has general inventory risk  physical loss inventory risk and credit risk 
the call center service revenue is recognized based on written pricing agreements with each manufacturer  on a per call  per email or per standard mail basis 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for bad debts is determined by reviewing all accounts receivable and applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors as well as past payment history and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
historically  the company s allowance has been sufficient for any customer write offs 
although the company cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate 
warranty reserves the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a general reserve based on historical claims experience 
the company considers actual warranty claims compared to net sales  then adjusts its reserve liability accordingly 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
management feels that historically its procedures have been adequate and does not anticipate that its assumptions are reasonably likely to change in the future 
other accounting policies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships  such as prime to libor spreads 
approximately  of outstanding debt at february  related to long term indebtedness under variable rate debt 
interest on the outstanding balance of this debt will be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate or the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in their agreements 
thus  the company s interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in a decrease of approximately  in pre tax net income assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at february  the company does not trade in derivative financial instruments
