item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
management s discussion and analysis forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis  and other sections of this annual report  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based on assumptions that management has made in light of experience in the industries in which the company operates  as well as management s perceptions of historical trends  current conditions  expected future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances 
these statements are not guarantees of performance or results 
they involve risks  uncertainties some of which are beyond the company s control and assumptions 
management believes that these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions 
many factors could affect the company s actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
these factors include  among other things  risk factors described from time to time in the company s reports to the securities and exchange commission  as well as future economic and market circumstances  industry conditions  company performance and financial results  operating efficiencies  availability and price of raw materials  availability and market acceptance of new products  product pricing  domestic and international competitive environments  and actions and policy changes of domestic and foreign governments 
general the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
as described in item b above  we established the utility support structures segment in  which includes the operations relating to utility support structures sold in north america 
all data for and have been reclassified to conform to the current segment structure

on april   we completed the purchase of newmark international  inc newmark  a manufacturer of concrete and steel pole structures mainly for the electrical utility industry 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash including transaction costs  plus the assumption of approximately million of interest bearing debt 
on may   we completed the purchase of wj whatley  inc whatley  a manufacturer of fiberglass poles principally for outdoor lighting applications 
the purchase price for the whatley shares was approximately million in cash including transaction costs  plus the assumption of approximately million of interest bearing debt 
on august   we completed the purchase of the net assets of sigma industries  inc sigma  a manufacturer of overhead sign structures mainly serving the eastern united states 
the purchase price for the net assets of this business was approximately million  plus the assumption of approximately million of interest bearing debt 
the results of newmark are reported in the utility support structures segment and the results of whatley and sigma are reported in the engineered support structures segment 
the results of these operations are included in our consolidated results starting on the closing dates of the acquisitions 
the funds used for these acquisitions were borrowed through our existing credit facilities 
see also liquidity and capital resources 
steel is a significant cost component of the products we manufacture 
in  we experienced substantial cost increases for rolled sheet  plate and other products made from steel 
significant increases of steel production in china drove up prices and created shortages of key steel producing inputs such as coke  iron ore and scrap steel  which led to restricted steel supplies 
this situation in turn caused rapid  unprecedented increases in what we paid for steel and created availability issues 
in some cases  suppliers broke pricing agreements on or added surcharges to existing contracts 
firm pricing and consignment programs from the steel mills were no longer available  which  along with uncertain availability and extended lead times  led us to increase our steel inventories above historical norms to ensure our ability to meet customer commitments 
where possible  we increased our sales prices to mitigate the impact of higher steel costs on operating income 
the negative impact on operating income as a result of higher steel costs that could not be passed on in the marketplace was approximately million 
the increase in sales as compared with was due to the impact of acquisitions completed in million  sales volume increases in the engineered support structures ess and tubing segments and sales price increases resulting from steel cost increases 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was down as compared with  due mainly to the impact of steel cost increases not covered by sales price increases 
sg a spending increased mainly due to the impact from acquisitions million  increased employee incentives due to improved operating profit million  currency translation effects million and increased commissions related to higher sales volumes million 
the increase in interest expense in as compared with was due to higher average borrowing levels in these higher borrowing levels were due to acquisitions funded by borrowings million and higher working capital levels resulting from higher sales levels and increased inventories due to steel industry conditions mentioned above 
the million in debt prepayment expenses in relates to a charge we recorded in the second quarter of mainly related to the prepayment of our promissory notes as part of the refinancing of our long term debt 
the decrease in the effective tax rate relates primarily to a reduction of million in deferred tax asset valuation allowances associated with net operating loss carryforwards in a european subsidiary due to improved profitability in that entity 
in  we recognized a profit in our share of the earnings of non consolidated subsidiaries  as compared with a loss in this improvement was the result of improved business conditions and operating performance of our non consolidated joint ventures in an irrigation distributor in argentina and a steel pole manufacturing facility in mexico 
minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was comparable to  as lower net earnings in our irrigation segment operations in brazil and south africa were offset by improved earnings in our irrigation segment retail store operation in california 
our ownership percentages in these locations are less than 
due to our acquisition activity and lower operating cash flows in as compared with  we have higher interest bearing debt than at the end of fiscal accordingly  our long term debt to invested capital ratio increased from in to in while this ratio is in excess of our internal goal of  we believe that  with continued improvements in earnings and working capital management  we will be able to reduce this ratio to below our internal goal over the next to months 
engineered support structures ess segment general the sales increase in the ess segment was related to the acquisition of whatley and sigma million  currency translation effects million  sales volume increases and sales price increases implemented to offset rising steel costs 
gross profit grew at a lower rate than sales  as sales price increases did not completely cover the increased cost of steel and the sales mix was unfavorable 
these factors were offset to a degree by improved gross margins in europe resulting from improved factory performance 
sg a spending was up mainly due to fiscal acquisitions million and currency translation effects million 
operating income improved in all regions  mainly as a result of sales volume increases in all regions  the impact of acquisitions million  and operational improvements in europe  where operating income improved by million in as compared with during  we reduced our cost structure in europe to position ourselves for better profitability 
while the impact of cost reductions was somewhat offset by severance costs  we believe that our current operating structure and management team are appropriate to allow us to build on for continued operating improvements 
operating profits in china grew by million in as compared with  due to continued sales growth 
lighting and traffic products in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales increased in as compared with due to a combination of a sales volume increase of approximately and sales price increases in response to higher steel prices 
market demand continues to be driven by government spending programs and the need for improved street and highway lighting and traffic control 
the current us federal highway program was extended throughout by a series of short term extensions and is currently extended through may we believe that a new six year spending program will be enacted in  which  if enacted  should provide for stability in the funding of projects that include street and area lighting and traffic structures 
commercial lighting sales in north america were down slightly in  as compared with competitive pricing in this market resulted in slightly lower orders from lighting fixture manufacturers  as some competitors did not increase sales prices as much as we did when steel prices escalated 
in europe  sales volumes increased modestly in local currency terms  as demand for lighting and traffic structures reflected slightly better economic conditions in our major market areas 
in china  sales were comparable to specialty products in north america  sales of specialty products were up approximately as compared with the most significant source of growth was from overhead sign structures 
in  we entered this market and was our first full year of operation 
sign structure sales of million in included those of sigma industries since its acquisition in august sales of wireless communication structures and components were up from a weak  as wireless carriers increased spending on new structures and antennas to improve coverage and service 
sales of wireless communication poles in china increased by approximately in as compared with  due to continued development of its wireless networks 
our sales of wireless structures in china have steadily grown over the years as we believe we have built a good reputation with the wireless carriers and benefited from the strong demand in wireless communication services in china 
while we expect relatively strong demand to continue in the future  growth rates may moderate from past growth rates 
utility products this product line includes sales of utility structures for markets outside of north america 
sales improved over  mainly due to sales growth in china of approximately million 
we continue to believe that as china grows its electrical generation and distribution capacity  we should see good demand for steel poles for electrical transmission  substation and distribution applications 
utility support structures segment the sharp increase in sales in as compared with was due to the acquisition of newmark in april million  improved sales volumes in our existing utility structures product line and increased sales prices 
while sales volumes of steel utility structures increased approximately in as compared with  our sales were particularly low in the second and third quarters of  when our order rates fell as we attempted to maintain pricing when market prices were falling 
newmark s sales volumes of concrete utility poles since its acquisition in april were approximately higher than the same period in in  demand for steel and concrete transmission  substation and distribution structures was stronger than in  as electrical utility companies increased spending for structures to improve the electrical grid system  despite the lack of us energy policy legislation 
gross profit improved at a higher rate than sales because the difficult pricing environment in improved somewhat in approximately million of the operating income improvement from to was due to the acquisition of newmark 
coatings segment coatings segment sales and profitability decreased in as compared with mainly due to lower anodizing service sales to a major customer 
while we still expect future sales to this customer  we do not expect such sales to return to historical levels 
in light of these lower sales volumes  we are making efforts to expand our anodizing customer base and strengthen our relationships with current customers 
we have also reduced our cost structure to further position ourselves for improved profitability in the future 
aside from the lower volumes  gross profit in this segment was also negatively impacted by approximately million of increased workers compensation costs in california 
we believe workers compensation reform legislation passed in california this year will help us better control workers compensation costs in the future 
galvanizing volumes were comparable to  with a modest improvement in profitability 
sg a spending in was comparable to irrigation segment the increase in irrigation segment sales was due to price increases associated with increased steel costs 
in north america  sales volumes of irrigation machines and related service parts were down approximately in  as compared with while the agricultural economy in general was favorable throughout most of  weakness in commodity prices and higher energy and other farm input costs have contributed to weakness in demand in the latter part of profitability in north america was up by million in as compared with  due to improved retail operations  good expense control and disciplined product pricing in light of rising steel costs 
in markets outside of north america  sales were similar to  after consideration of currency translation effects 
sales in brazil and south africa were slightly lower than strong sales levels  reflecting somewhat weaker farm commodity prices 
the strong south african currency versus the us dollar has negatively impacted the competitiveness of farm exports in that region 
sales decreases in these regions were offset by stronger sales in other regions 
international profitability in was down by million from a strong  mostly related to lower operating income in brazil and south africa 
tubing segment tubing segment sales increased mainly through sales price increases to pass along increased steel costs  although sales volume was up approximately as well 
we believe that sales demand was driven to some extent by rapidly rising steel prices and our availability of steel 
the increase in gross profit was due to an improved pricing environment for our commodity type products  our ability to pass along increased steel costs to the market and an unfavorable inventory adjustment that was recorded in sg a expense was up in as compared to due to employee incentives million related to increased operating income and sales commissions million due to increased sales 
other our other businesses include our machine tool accessory business in france  our industrial fastener business in the us and wind energy development 
sales and profitability were down in  as compared with  due to approximately lower demand for machine tool accessories in europe 
our spending to develop a structure for the wind energy industry was million in as compared with million in we continue to make progress on this new product development initiative and we remain optimistic as to our future in this business 
net corporate expense the increase in net corporate expenses in as compared with mainly related to increased employee incentives associated with improved operating income approximately million  and approximately million in incremental costs related to compliance with the internal controls over financial reporting provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of fiscal compared with fiscal overview the sales decrease in as compared with was the result of lower sales in the utility support structures and coatings segments  offset somewhat by increased sales in the irrigation and ess segments 
due to a weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro and the south african rand  sales in dollar terms were positively impacted by million 
the sales decrease after taking into account the currency translation effect was 
gross profit margins were lower in most segments  except that margins improved slightly in the irrigation segment  mainly as a result of improved margins in the international markets 
in particular  margins were significantly impacted by severe pricing pressure in the utility support structures segment 
lower sales in the utility support structures and coatings segments also resulted in lower coverage of fixed manufacturing costs  which further contributed to lower profitability 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative sg a expense was mainly due to a reduction of approximately million in employee incentives and supplemental k matches 
this decrease was directly related to the decrease in our profitability and return on invested capital 
this decrease was offset to some extent by currency translation impacts related to a weaker us dollar  which increased our expenses in dollar terms 
the decrease in interest expense was principally related to lower average borrowing levels in our capital spending and acquisition activity in has continued to be lower than historical levels and our share repurchases that year were not significant 
as a result  our free cash flows were used to reduce our interest bearing debt 
our effective tax rate was comparable to  as there have been no major changes to tax rates or our general income tax position for losses in nonconsolidated subsidiaries were lower in as compared with  due to some improvement in our irrigation segment joint ventures in argentina and the us in addition  in we recorded a million impairment charge in our investment in our us nonconsolidated subsidiary 
minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries was higher in  mainly related to strong profitability gains in our irrigation segment operations in brazil and south africa 
our ownership percentages in these locations are less than 
the financial accounting standards board fas interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  is applicable to public entities that have interests in variable interest entities for periods ending after december  under fin  the assets  liabilities and results of activities of variable interest entities are required to be reported in the consolidated financial statements of their primary beneficiaries 
we assessed our relationships with variable interest entities and determined that we were the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity related to our lease of transportation equipment 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting of million net of related tax effects of million 
in addition  we recorded a net increase to property  plant and equipment of million and an increase to interest bearing debt of million 
we generated solid operating cash flow during and and we used those cash flows to reduce our interest bearing debt 
our long term debt to invested capital ratio was reduced from to in engineered support structures ess segment general the sales increase in the ess segment related to currency translation effects  as stronger sales in the lighting and traffic product line were essentially offset by lower sales in the specialty product line 
the decrease in operating income was the result of higher sg a spending in europe  where spending increased from due to our efforts to expand sales distribution and manufacturing in the region and expand our product offerings 
lighting and traffic products in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales increased by in market demand continued to be driven by government spending programs and the need for improved street and highway lighting and traffic control 
the commercial lighting sales in were essentially flat with  as commercial construction and the related demand for area lighting for parking lots and common areas was somewhat weaker than in building alliances with lighting fixture manufacturers helped us to maintain sales despite some softness in the overall market 
profitability in north america improved  principally due to increased sales 
in europe  sales increased in local currency terms  as most of the sales increase related to efforts to expand our manufacturing presence and sales coverage in the region 
in china  sales were down slightly  but we are continuing to make progress in finding local market segments that are attractive and capitalize on export opportunities to generate sales and profits 
specialty products in north america  sales of specialty products were down as compared with wireless carriers and build to suit companies continued to curtail spending on new structures for the wireless communication industry as they focused on cash flow and capital management 
structures and antennas being installed have generally been done so as to augment existing networks to improve coverage and service 
while sales were lower and pricing remained very competitive  our factory and administrative costs were reduced by approximately million this year which helped to minimize the impact of these lower sales on the segment s operating income 
in  this product line also began to manufacture overhead sign and low voltage substation structures  while sales in these products were not material  we were successful in achieving orders for future delivery 
we continue to experience strong demand for wireless communication poles in china  as they continue to pursue buildout of their wireless networks 
utility products in china  our sales increased approximately million in as compared with we have been successful in penetrating the utility market with transmission and substation products 
utility support structures segment the sales decrease in as compared with related to a combination of lower market demand and a very competitive pricing environment 
market demand for steel poles for transmission and substations was somewhat lower than in utility companies and independent power producers have reduced spending for electrical generation and transmission projects due to factors such as a lack of us energy legislation and some financing constraints 
the key factor that affected profitability was the severe pricing pressure in the marketplace throughout the pricing pressure resulted from some weakness in the market  combined with new competitors in the form of manufacturers who also compete for sales of pole structures in the wireless communication market 
in the first quarter  our backlogs and sales fell as we attempted to maintain pricing 
our pricing was more aggressive in the second quarter and we were successful in increasing our order rate  although sales prices were substantially less than what we experienced in the last few years 
sales in the fourth quarter were similar to  although at lower margin levels than in the past 
the impact of pricing and unfavorable product mix on operating income was approximately million in coatings segment the decrease in coatings segment sales in as compared with was due to weakness in the industrial economy in the us throughout in addition  the amount of business with our other locations was down in  as lower sales in the utility support structures segment and the specialty product line in the ess segment also led to lower production levels in our galvanizing locations that serve those businesses 
as a result of these factors  sales in our galvanizing locations were lower than in operating income decreased due to lower sales and gross margins  offset by reduced sg a expenses 
our galvanizing operations have relatively high fixed costs 
when production fluctuates  it can have a significant impact on earnings 
the estimated total impact of the volume decrease on gross margin was million 
gross margins were also impacted by approximately million in higher workers compensation costs in most of this increase occurred in our california operations  where the legal environment in the workers compensation area is difficult for employers 
sg a spending was comparable to levels 
operating income in included a million gain on the sale of a facility in our minnesota location 
irrigation segment irrigation segment sales in increased in both domestic and international markets 
in north america  improved commodity prices  dry growing conditions in our main market areas  a generally favorable us farm bill and low interest rates contributed to increased demand for mechanized irrigation machines and related service parts 
the increase in sales and some improved pricing resulted in higher operating income in in the international marketplace after considering currency translation impacts  sales were similar to sales in the middle east market were down substantially  as the war in iraq impacted project sales in the region 
in brazil  we achieved record sales and profits  as market conditions were very strong 
good agricultural commodity prices and favorable government programs helped drive the strong sales demand and contributed to our excellent operating performance in in south africa  sales in local currency terms were down slightly from our record sales in  but profitability improved  due to improved operations management and pricing that led to improved gross margins 
good agricultural commodity prices and generally dry growing conditions helped maintain strong demand for mechanized irrigation machines in the region 
overall profitability in our international operations improved by  about half of which was due to currency translation effects resulting from a weaker us dollar  especially in relation to the south african rand 
tubing segment in the tubing segment  sales were slightly lower than last year  although sales were stronger in the fourth quarter as compared with  reflecting some strengthening economic conditions in the us this segment was impacted significantly by the steel market  as most of the cost of tubing is hot rolled sheet steel 
in the fourth quarter of  steel prices started to rise and there was some concern about availability of steel in the near future 
in these conditions  our sales tend to increase  as customers order more tubing to reduce the risk of future shortages and avoid future price increases 
operating income was down from due to some pricing pressures in commodity type products and an unfavorable inventory adjustment 
other our other businesses include our machine tool accessory business in france  our industrial fastener business in the us and wind energy development 
sales were up mostly due to currency translation impacts and profitability was down mainly due to higher spending on developing a new structure for the wind energy industry 
our spending on development activity was million in  as compared with million in net corporate expense the principal reasons for lower net corporate expenses in as compared with were reduced employee incentives associated with lower profitability and return on invested capital approximately million and approximately million associated with an increase in the amount of corporate computer expenses allocated to our operating units 
in addition  rental costs on our corporate headquarters building decreased by million in as compared with due to lower interest rates  as our rental costs are based on the libor plus a spread 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows working capital and operating cash flows net working capital was million at fiscal year end  as compared with million at year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of december   as compared with at december  the increase in working capital included approximately million in net working capital acquired as part of the newmark  whatley and sigma acquisitions 
the increase in working capital was also due to higher sales in as compared with  which resulted in higher accounts receivable and inventories 
availability issues  extended lead times and lack of firm pricing for steel in further contributed to the increase in inventory levels in over levels 
while inventories are down from the end of the third quarter of  they are not yet down to historical levels 
operating cash flow was million in  as compared with million in and million in the decrease in operating cash flow in as compared with related mainly to higher working capital levels in investing cash flows the most significant investing cash flow item was the million expended net of cash acquired related to the newmark  whatley and sigma acquisitions 
capital spending was million in  as compared with million in  and million in our depreciation and amortization expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
throughout much of the s our capital spending was relatively high as we added manufacturing capacity in a number of areas  most notably our irrigation segment factory in mccook  nebraska and our utility support structures factory in jasper  tennessee 
we have not made any substantial capacity additions in the past three years 
in addition  we made a number of acquisitions from to that added capacity and allowed us to expand our market coverage 
while we do not expect capital spending to remain at levels over the long term  we do not anticipate a substantial increase in capital spending in the near future 
fiscal capital expenditures are estimated to be between and million 
financing cash flows total interest bearing debt increased from million in to million as of december   an increase of million 
most of the increase in borrowing occurred in our new major long term credit facilities described below and was due to our acquisitions  which totaled million including million in debt that was assumed as part of the acquisitions 
sources of financing and capital we have historically funded our growth  capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing 
we have an internal long term objective to maintain long term debt as a percent of capital at or below 
at december   our long term debt to invested capital ratio was  as compared with at the end of fiscal this internal objective is exceeded from time to time in order to take advantage of opportunities to grow and improve our businesses 
we believe the acquisitions described above were appropriate opportunities to expand our market coverage and product offerings and generate earnings growth 
while our long term debt to capital ratio is in excess of our objective after the effect of our refinancing  we believe our cash flows will enable us to reduce our debt levels to over the next to months 
this estimate is dependent on our level of acquisition activity and steel industry availability and pricing issues  which are causing us to carry more inventory than we customarily maintain 
our priorities in use of future cash flows are as follows fund internal growth initiatives in core businesses pay down interest bearing debt invest in acquisitions clearly connected to our core businesses or an existing competency return money to our shareholders through increased dividends or common stock repurchases at appropriate share prices our debt financing at december  consisted mainly of long term debt 
we also maintain certain short term bank lines of credit totaling million  million of which was unused at december  as a result of the newmark acquisition and to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment  we refinanced our major long term credit facilities in may the refinancing included million in senior subordinated notes and a new million bank financing arrangement consisting of a million revolving credit agreement and a million term loan 
the proceeds were used to repay the old revolving credit facility  the bridge loan obligation incurred to fund part of the newmark acquisition and to prepay million of promissory notes 
the prepaid promissory notes contained yield maintenance provisions that required us to pay as a prepayment premium of approximately million in addition to the million in debt  plus approximately million in accrued interest 
the million senior subordinated notes bear interest at per annum and are due in may we may repurchase the notes after five years at specified prepayment premiums and these notes are guaranteed by certain of our us subsidiaries 
the million revolving credit agreement carries an interest rate spread over the libor of to basis points  depending on our ratio of debt to earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
at december   we had million outstanding under the revolving credit agreement at an interest rate of per annum 
the revolving credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement 
at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under this facility 
the million term loan accrues interest based on the libor plus a spread of to basis points  depending on our debt to ebitda ratio  and requires quarterly principal payments beginning in through the annualized principal payments beginning in in millions are     and the effective interest rate on this loan at december  was per annum 
in the event of a sharp decrease in demand for our products  resulting profitability reductions would reduce our operating cash flows and may affect our ability to grow 
likewise  low profitability or operating losses could impact our compliance with key long term debt covenants  which could ultimately result in default of these debt agreements and acceleration of payments due 
these factors could come from a number of sources  such as a prolonged depression in the us farm economy  a substantial reduction in government including state and local funding of the federal highway program and a prolonged us economic recession 
financial obligations and financial commitments we have future financial obligations related to payment of principal and interest on interest bearing debt  including capital lease obligations  various operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations as of december  are summarized as follows  in millions of dollars contractual obligations total after long term debt capital leases unconditional purchase obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations long term debt principally consists of the million of senior subordinated notes  the million term loan and the million revolving credit agreement million was outstanding at december  
obligations under these agreements could be accelerated in event of non compliance with covenants 
at december   the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
capital leases relate principally to a production facility in france and transportation and office equipment 
operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business 
as of december   our interest obligations associated with our long term debt and capital leases were as follows in millions of dollars after unconditional purchase obligations relate to purchase orders for aluminum  zinc and steel for periods up to one year 
we believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment 
these leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts 
the most significant operating lease is the lease of our corporate headquarters office building in omaha  nebraska 
on this lease  we lease the entire office complex and sublease other office space in the complex to outside parties 
the lease payments are based on the london interbank offer rate libor  plus a spread that varies depending on our financial leverage 
the current lease obligation expires in  at which time we may elect to renew the lease at a negotiated rate and duration  purchase the facility from the lessor for million  or terminate the lease 
in the event that we terminate the lease and the facility is sold for less than million  we are obligated to pay the difference between the sales price and million to the owner 
this lease also contains certain covenants that are similar to those in our revolving credit agreement  including covenants related to financial leverage and coverage of certain fixed charges 
the estimated fair value of the residual value guarantee is million  which we have classified on the balance sheet in other noncurrent liabilities 
this lease was reviewed under the provisions of fas interpretation r consolidation of variable interest entities  and we determined that we were not required to consolidate the lessor entity because we were not the primary beneficiary 
we also have certain commercial commitments related to contingent events that could create a financial obligation for us 
except as noted below  these commitments at december  are as follows in millions of dollars commitment expiration period other commercial commitments total amounts committed thereafter standby letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments the above commitments include million in loan guarantees of non consolidated subsidiaries in argentina and mexico and are in proportion to our ownership percentage of these companies or are accompanied by a guarantee from the majority owner to us 
as prescribed by the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  the fair value of the guarantees was million and is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on our december  balance sheet 
we also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts 
market risk changes in prices certain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price 
the most significant materials are steel  aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
over the last three years  hot rolled steel prices have been volatile 
in  prices rose sharply early in the year before falling later in the year 
in  prices rose dramatically throughout much of the year 
the volatility in price over time was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply  government tariffs and the costs of steel making inputs 
we have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years 
our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to minimize the impact of volatility in prices and sales price increases where possible 
with respect to natural gas  we hedge a percentage of forecasted usage through the use of natural gas swap contracts 
in  these strategies as they pertain to steel were not as effective as in the past  as suppliers discontinued fixed price contracts and consignment programs 
risk management market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and natural gas 
we normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures except as described below  nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rates our interest bearing debt is a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have an impact on interest expense of approximately million in and million in foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are not material  and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings  fair value and cash flows from these transactions are immaterial 
much of our cash in non us entities is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million in and million in we manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate 
the following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our investments at year end assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar 
in millions europe south america asia south africa commodity risk natural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories  especially in our coatings segment galvanizing operations  where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot dipped galvanizing process 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to hedge of our us natural gas requirements for the upcoming months through purchase of natural gas swaps based on nymex futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged 
the objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden  significant increases in the price of natural gas 
annual us gas requirements are approximately  mmbtu 
we have hedged approximately of our expected us requirements through april and approximately of our expected requirements for june the fair value of these instruments is based on quoted market prices from the nymex 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in price 
as of december  our market risk exposure related to future natural gas requirements being hedged was approximately million based on a sensitivity analysis 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
since we forward price only a portion of our natural gas requirements  this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments would be more than offset by lower costs for all natural gas we purchase 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements 
we must make estimates on a number of items  such as provisions for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  impairments of long lived assets  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
further  we re evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change 
actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed periodically with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full  we consider age of the accounts receivable customer credit history customer financial information reasons for non payment product  service or billing issues 
if our customer s financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
warranties all of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider our experience with costs to correct the product problem in the field  including labor costs costs for replacement parts other direct costs associated with warranty claims the number of product units subject to warranty claims in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
the key assumption in our estimate is the rate we apply to those recent sales  which is based on historical claims experience 
if this estimated rate changed by  the impact on operating income would be approximately million 
if our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated  then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims 
inventories we use the last in first out lifo method to determine the value of the majority of our inventory 
the remainder of our inventory is valued on a first in first out fifo basis 
in periods of rising costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in lower profits than fifo  because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
conversely  in periods of falling costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in higher profits than the fifo method 
in  we experienced substantially higher costs to produce inventory than in  due mainly to higher costs for steel and steel related products 
this resulted in higher cost of goods sold and lower operating income of approximately million than had all our inventory been valued on the fifo method 
we write down slow moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses  the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory 
if our ability to realize value on slow moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional write downs of the inventory may be required 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that were acquired in business acquisitions 
we have assigned useful lives to our property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from to years 
we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter  which coincides with our strategic planning process 
we value our reporting units using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value 
the key assumptions are the discount rate and the annual free cash flow 
we also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units 
as allowed for under sfas  we rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination and the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
in the case of most of our reporting units  the above criteria have been met and no further evaluation was required 
if our assumptions about intangible assets change as a result of events or circumstances  and we believe the assets may have declined in value  then we may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
for example  in  we determined that our investment in an irrigation dealer in north america was impaired  which resulted in a writedown of million 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names and their values are separately assessed from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing 
this assessment is made using the relief from royalty method  under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value 
the most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales  the royalty rate and the after tax discount rate 
for our evaluation purposes  the royalty rates used vary between and of sales and the after tax discount rate of  which we estimate to be our after tax cost of capital 
stock options our employees are periodically granted stock options by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
as allowed under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we do not record any compensation expense on the income statement with respect to options granted to employees and directors 
alternatively  under gaap  we could have recorded a compensation expense based on the fair value of employee stock options 
as described in note in the consolidated financial statements  had we recorded a fair value based compensation expense for stock options  earnings per share would have been to less than what was reported for each of the  and fiscal years

sfas no 
r is effective beginning in the company s third quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating how we will implement this new standard and the expected impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our results of operations and cash flows 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while future taxable income and tax planning strategies are considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if a deferred tax asset is estimated to be not fully realizable in the future  a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net income in the period the determination was made 
likewise  should we subsequently determine that we would be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets related mainly to tax credit carryforwards  with a valuation allowance of million 
in  we removed million of prior valuation allowances and  accordingly  reduced our income tax expense  because we determined that  based on facts and circumstances  the realization of these deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
if these circumstances change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets  resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million related to nonconsolidated subsidiaries which have been fully offset by a valuation adjustment

 inventory costs 
sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
under this pronouncement  abnormal amounts of these costs are required to be charged against earnings rather than included in the cost of inventory on the balance sheet 
sfas no

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
sfas no 
amends existing guidance regarding the accounting for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets 
under this pronouncement  the accounting for exchanges of similar productive assets that are not expected to significantly change the future cash flows of an entity will be an exception to the general rule that exchanges are accounted for based on the relative fair values of the exchanged assets 
this pronouncement is effective at the beginning of our third quarter of fiscal we do not believe this pronouncement will have a significant effect on our financial statements
