table of contents was a significant year for the company 
in  while operating as clicklearn  inc  our revenue was million and we ended the year with employees 
the acquisition of docent  inc  a company similar in size to us  had the impact of adding to our business a company with million in revenue in and employees at the end of we also moved our corporate headquarters to mountain view  california  the former docent headquarters and restructured the board and senior management team to include a number of former docent board members and officers 
shortly after the acquisition  we implemented a restructuring plan that reduced headcount in the first and second quarters by thirty seven employees  as well as not replacing a number of employees who left the company voluntarily  and closed or reduced our usage of a number of facilities 
these actions were intended to bring our cost structure in line with our revenue 
during the year  our revenue increased quarter by quarter from million in the first quarter  much of which was before the docent acquisition  to million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter that coincided with the release of our new product sumtotal our net loss improved in line with the revenue growth  particularly in the second and third quarters as the benefits of the restructuring program were realized 
the net loss was million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
from a cash flow perspective  the benefits of the acquisition are even more apparent 
the cash flow is not impacted by the various non cash charges relating to purchase accounting  including stock based compensation  amortization of intangible assets acquired and in process research and development ipr d expense 
as a result  on a net loss of million  we generated million in cash from operating activities 
we acquired million in cash and equivalents as part of the acquisition  used million to pay off our line of credit  invested million  net  in short term investments and including other financing and investing activities  we ended the year with a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
at the end of the year  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
these balances  together with the cash generated from operations  are expected to be sufficient to finance operations for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
however  certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments reflect practices  information provided by our customers and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition  estimating allowances for sales returns and the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring  and allowance for deferred tax assets 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our disclosure committee and the audit committee of our board of directors 
refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we follow detailed revenue recognition guidelines  which are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments 
we do not record revenue on sales to customers whose ability to pay is in doubt at the time of sale 
rather  revenue is recognized from these customers as payment is received 
the determination of a customer s ability to pay requires significant judgment 
in this regard  our management considers  among other things  the geographic location of the customer  the financial viability of the customer and the past payment histories of the customer in assessing a customer s ability to pay 
revenue arrangements with extended payment terms are generally considered not to be fixed or determinable and  accordingly  we do not recognize revenue on these arrangements until the customer payment becomes due 
the determination of whether extended payment terms are fixed or determinable requires significant judgment by management  including assessing such factors as the past payment history with the individual customer and evaluating the risk of concessions over an extended payment period 
the determinations that we make can materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
many of our software contracts include consulting implementation services 
consulting revenues from these contracts are accounted for separately from the perpetual license revenues because the consulting arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of the same services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion date or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our operating results 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers or any of the other factors we use to analyze credit worthiness were to worsen  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we make judgments about the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we test the impairment of goodwill annually or on an interim basis if indicators of impairment arise 
in order to estimate the fair value of intangible assets  we make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business to which the asset relates and typically estimate future cash flows to be generated by these businesses 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors  such as industry and economic trends and internal factors  such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses would result in greater impairment charges  which would increase our net loss and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions would result in smaller impairment charges  lower net loss and higher asset values 
restructuring charge in the first and second quarters of fiscal  we recorded significant accruals in connection with our restructuring programs under sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
these accruals include estimates pertaining to the ability to sublease facilities in mountain view  california  framingham  massachusetts and bellevue  washington 
these estimates are reviewed and potentially revised on a quarterly basis and  to the extent that future vacancy rates and sublease rates vary adversely from those estimates  we may incur additional losses that are not included in our accrual for vacated facilities at december  conversely  unanticipated improvements in vacancy rates or sublease rates  or termination settlements for less than our accrued amounts  may result in a reversal of a portion of the accrued balance and a benefit on our statement of operations in a future period 
such reversals would be reflected as a credit to restructuring charges 
allowance for deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce all of the deferred tax assets to the amount that are more likely than not to be realized by us 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase reported income or reduce loss in the applicable period and increase stockholders equity on the balance sheet in the period such determination was made 
sources of revenue we generate revenue from the license of our products and performance of services to enterprises  systems integrators  reseller partners  and content providers 
to date  we have generated our license and services revenue primarily from direct sales  including referral sales by our system integrators to enterprise customers  and to a lesser extent  through resellers of our products and services 
enterprise customers have the option of purchasing perpetual licenses or renting time based licenses 
our perpetual licensees pay a one time  initial fee based on the number of users and may enter into separate annual maintenance contracts that include the right to receive periodic unspecified upgrades  error corrections  and telephone and web based support 
our time based licenses require license holders to pay a monthly fee  which is based on the number of users and includes maintenance and support 
customers with perpetual or time based licenses may also outsource to us the hosting of their system on a third party s server for a monthly fee and an initial set up fee 
in conjunction with the licensing of our software  we offer implementation and training services 
to date  most of our customer revenue has been generated by perpetual software licenses  and maintenance and consulting services 
we generate revenue from our reseller partners who purchase our products and maintenance services and resell them to our reseller partners customers 
to date  resellers have typically sold perpetual licenses of our software and annual maintenance agreements 
they usually provide additional professional services themselves  but may also resell some of our professional services 
generally  they receive a discount from our license list prices 

table of contents costs and expenses our cost of license revenue includes the amortization of developed and core technology from the docent acquisition  the cost of third party software and content we resell 
our cost of service and maintenance revenue includes salaries and related expenses of our professional services organization and charges related to hosting activities and other third party services

sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions and expenditures related to public relations  advertising  trade shows and marketing campaigns 
general and administrative expenses also include legal and financial services fees 
stock based compensation consists of amortization of unearned stock based compensation recorded in connection with stock option grants to our employees

no customer accounted for greater than of our total consolidated revenue in one customer accounted for and of our total consolidated revenue from continuing operations in and  respectively 
we experience quarterly seasonality in the licensing of our products and delivery of our services 
typically  revenues at docent  clicklearn and sumtotal systems have been lower in our first fiscal quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth fiscal quarter because i many of our customers utilize a significant portion of their capital budgets at the end of their fiscal year  ii the majority of our customers begin a new fiscal year on january  and iii capital expenditures tend to be lower in an organization s first fiscal quarter than in its fourth fiscal quarter 
we anticipate that this seasonality will continue

amortization of intangibles 
costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the beta stage 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we capitalized certain project costs recorded after technological feasibility was established on our virtual classroom server product  such costs started to be amortized when the product was released on april  we recorded amortization expenses under sfas no

restructuring charge 
the acquisition of docent by clicklearn in the first quarter of fiscal  forming sumtotal systems  caused excess facilities and redundant employee positions 
 of the docent purchase price has been allocated to accrue future rental costs for building in mountain view  california that was exited in september during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an  restructuring charge  which consisted of  in employee severance costs and  in facility exit costs 
employee severance consists of severance and other benefits resulting from a reduction in force across all company functions of thirty three employees 
facility costs represent the fair value of the lease liabilities relating to the closure of a facility in framingham  massachusetts which includes sublease income 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional  restructuring charge  which consisted of  in employee severance costs and  million in facility exit costs 
employee severance consists of severance and other benefits resulting from a reduction of three service and maintenance employees and one sales and marketing employee 
facility costs represent the fair value of the lease liabilities relating to the partial closure of a facility in bellevue  washington which includes sublease income 

table of contents the following table depicts the restructuring activity in thousands balance at december  purchase price allocations additions cash expenditures balance at december  vacated facilities employee severance accrued amounts for vacated facilities will be paid over the lease term of the mountain view  california  bellevue  washington and framingham  massachusetts facilities  which end in may  december and january  respectively 
in process research and development 
costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the beta stage 
to date  software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant  and all software development costs have been charged to research and development expenses 
we assigned million to acquired ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use and wrote off these assets in the docent acquisition in accordance with fasb interpretation number fin no 
 applicability of fasb no 
 business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
to estimate the value of the ipr d  we calculated the expected cash flows attributed to the completed portion of the ipr d 
these cash flows considered the contribution of the core developed technology  the risks related to the development of the ipr d and the percent complete as of the valuation date as well as the expected life cycle of the technology 
finally  the cash flows attributed to the completed portion of the ipr d  net of the core developed technology contribution  were discounted to their present value  using a discount rate of  to estimate the value of the ipr d 
these projects were completed as part of the releases of sumtotal suite and in december and april  respectively 
stock based compensation 
the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations including fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb  has been applied to account for sumtotal systems fixed plan stock options 
under this method  compensation expense is recorded only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price on the date of the grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
as allowed by sfas no 
 sumtotal systems has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting described above and has adopted only the disclosure requirements of sfas no 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised r  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the effective date of the new standard for our consolidated financial statements is our first fiscal quarter of upon adoption  this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net loss within our footnotes as is our current practice found in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
compensation expense calculated under sfas no 
r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options 
on may   the board of directors of sumtotal systems approved the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share previously awarded to its employees  including its section officers  under each of the sumtotal systems equity compensation plans 
this approval was based on a recommendation of the compensation committee of the board of directors  which consists entirely of independent directors  and reflects an approximate premium over the average closing price of sumtotal systems common stock over the previous ninety days 
the acceleration of vesting was effective for stock options outstanding as of may  options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock  or of sumtotal systems outstanding unvested options   of which are held by section officers  will become exercisable upon sumtotal systems compliance with nasdaq and sec rules 
the purpose of the acceleration is to enable sumtotal systems to avoid recognizing the future compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r  when effective  will require all share based payments to employees  including granting of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense on sumtotal systems consolidated statement of operations  rather than as a disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  based on their fair values 
sfas no 
r will become effective to sumtotal systems beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the pre tax charge to be avoided amounts to approximately million over the course of the remainder of the original vesting periods  which  on average  is approximately years from january  the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on generally accepted accounting principles because there was not a modification of the option grants 
sumtotal systems also believes that because the options to be accelerated have exercise prices in excess of the current market value of the sumtotal systems common stock  the options have limited economic value and are not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention

equity in losses of an affiliate 
equity in losses of an affiliate related to clicklearn japan kk  our former joint venture with softbank media marketing corporation  softbank publishing inc and toppan forms co

we used the equity method of accounting whereby we recorded our ownership portion of the joint ventures net income or loss 
for the years ended december   and  our equity in losses of an affiliate were   and  respectively 
as part of the agreement with softbank media marketing corporation  softbank publishing inc and toppan forms co 
ltd 
on august   we transferred our shares in clicklearn japan kk to softbank media and marketing and as a result we will not have any future equity related expenses relating to the losses of this company 
provision for income taxes 
we incurred operating losses for all periods from inception through december   and therefore have not recorded a provision for us income taxes 
we recorded a provision for foreign and state income taxes of  for   for  and for 
table of contents as of december   sumtotal systems had nol carry forwards for us federal tax purposes of approximately million and for state tax purposes of approximately million 
approximately million of the federal nol carry forwards were acquired in business combinations 
if these nol carry forwards become recoverable in the future  they will first be used to reduce to zero any goodwill associated with the business combinations prior to being used to reduce any income tax expense 
our ability to utilize net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial limitation due to the change in ownership  as defined in the internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
the federal and state tax loss carry forwards are available to reduce future taxable income and expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
we estimate that approximately million of the nols will not be utilizable because of internal revenue code section limitations 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets as of december  has been established to reflect these uncertainties

loss from discontinued operations 
in the first quarter of  we sold certain assets of our custom content development business  including equipment and a customer list  to niit 
these assets were sold pursuant to an asset purchase agreement for million  resulting in a gain of  based on the book value of those assets 
as a part of the transaction  niit acted as a subcontractor to complete work in process and will be our primary strategic partner for custom content development services 
in this regard  we will refer custom content development work to niit  which will contract directly with customers to complete the work 
the sale to niit did not include any assets related to our contract to provide custom content development services for the wang 
at the time of the sale to niit  we intended to continue to provide these services to the wang 
however  the wang contract differed from our typical custom content development contract in the following important ways the contract did not provide for invoicing upon achievement of defined tasks over the term of the contract  rather invoicing was subject to acceptance of each completed curriculum  the content was simpler to develop  but each curriculum was much longer generally in excess of one hundred hours  rather than the more typical thirty to fifty hours  and we did not contract with the wang directly  but rather through a subcontract to a government contractor 
this contract structure required us to fully fund the development through completion of the longer curriculum with no interim progress payments and further delayed payment once invoiced since payments were made by the wang to the contractor  which then paid us within days of receiving payment 
because of the demands this contract placed on our working capital  we negotiated with the wang to allow us to terminate the contract and transition the work to the prime contractor 
as a part of these negotiations  we agreed to forfeit our rights to approximately million of work performed in return for allowing the early contract termination 
upon termination of the wang contract  we had ceased all operations in connection with our custom content development business and began presenting the results of that business as discontinued operations 
results related to our custom content development business for the current year and all prior periods have been reclassified as loss from discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   we reclassified  of revenue  million of costs related to revenue  million of expenses  and  of other income as a combined loss from discontinued operations of million 
we had no costs from discontinued operations in or the bulk of expenses reflect the termination costs for personnel  facilities and the wang contract during the first and third quarters of 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  up from million in cash and cash equivalents on december  the change in cash is due primarily to the cash acquired in the acquisition  net of payments  of million from the acquisition of docent 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  the cash provided during the period was due to a million increase in deferred revenue from additional bookings during the period  a million decrease in other long term assets and non cash activities consisting of million for the amortization of intangible assets  a million write off of ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  million for stock based compensation  million for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  million for a loss on the disposal of property and equipment  million for equity in losses from affiliate  million increase for provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts  million increase in accounts payable and million for amortization of discount on debt  offset by a net loss of million  a million increase in accounts receivable  a million decrease in accrued liabilities and a million decrease in the restructuring accrual 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and million of accounts receivable  up from million and million  respectively on december  cash increased primarily as a result of our completing a private placement of common stock and warrants with net proceeds of million in june of offset by uses of cash of million 
cash used in operating activities in was million 
a net loss of million was partially offset by amortization of intangibles of million  depreciation and amortization of million and recovery of bad debts of million 
other operating assets and liabilities also generated million in cash flow primarily as result of a million increase in deferred revenue 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  due primarily to the million of cash acquired  net of payments  associated with the docent acquisition and million in sales of short term investments  offset by million in purchases of short term investments  million in purchases of equipment and million in cash used for asset purchase agreements with distributors in japan and australia

net cash used in investing activities in was primarily the result of capital expenditures and a purchase of technology for million  offset by million provided by the sale of certain assets used in our custom content development business to niit usa 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  due to million in net repayments on the working capital line at silicon valley bank and the repayment of a million note payable resulting from our acquisition of clicklearn japan kk  offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  common stock warrants and exercises of common stock options 
in march  we cancelled our million working capital line of credit at silicon valley bank 
we paid a fee of  to silicon valley bank associated with the cancellation and incurred a charge of  associated with warrants related to the line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in due primarily to a private placement to accredited investors in in which we sold  shares of our common stock and issued investors warrants for the purchase of an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net cash from borrowings of million  amounts received from exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp

at december   our contractual obligations and commercial commitments were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years years years thereafter operating leases accrued restructured facility lease payments 
table of contents we have entered into various arrangements with hosting services vendors and various non cancelable operating facility lease agreements for our offices throughout the us and for our international subsidiaries with original lease periods expiring through in addition  we are under contract to fulfill our obligation for facility leases for offices that were subleased to third party companies under restructuring plans 
the difference between the future operating lease liabilities and the fair market value of the operating leases is accrued within the restructuring accrual balance 
further information on restructuring facility payments can be found in note restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
further information on operating leases and software resale and distribution commitment can be found in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the contractual commitments listed above we had a liability for deferred revenue of million at december   up from million at december  deferred revenue is created when we bill clients for product or services prior to recognition of the related revenue 
approximately of deferred revenue in resulted from contracts to deliver support and maintenance for our software products 
these contracts typically have terms of twelve months  therefore we recognize the revenue ratably over their life 
when the contracts expire  we contact the client and request renewal  starting the deferred revenue cycle again 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources  combined with cash flows generated from revenues  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital  capital expense and business expansion requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we will continue to monitor our cash and liquidity and will seek additional financing or make additional expense reductions if it becomes required 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our future revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  the success of our existing and new product and service offerings and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all

employee stock options our stock option program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders 
our cumulative potential dilution for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the potential dilution percentage is calculated as the new option grants for the year  net of options forfeited by employees leaving sumtotal systems  divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year 
many of these options  which have ten year exercise periods  have exercise prices substantially higher than the current market price of our common stock 
at december   of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price of our common stock 
the compensation committee of the board of directors reviews and approves all stock option grants to executive officers 
the chief executive officer approves all individual stock option grants to non executive officers 
options granted from fiscal year through fiscal are summarized as follows share amounts in thousands options outstanding at december  acquisition of docent options options granted options exercised cancellations options outstanding at december  average annual options granted  net of cancellations weighted average shares outstanding for the three years ended december  shares outstanding at december  options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at december  average annual options granted net of cancellations as a percentage of average shares outstanding on december   and 
table of contents generally  we grant stock options to our new employees when hired and our existing employees on an annual basis 
during the year ended december   we made grants of options to purchase approximately million shares of our stock  which resulted in a net grant of options for million shares after deducting million shares for cancelled options 
the net options granted in after forfeitures represented of our total outstanding shares of approximately million as of december  adoption of accounting standards in december  the fasb issued fin no

r was applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin no 
r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and non controlling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin no 
r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the vie

eitf no 
states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in substance common stock of a corporation  provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee

on september   the fasb approved the issuance of fasb staff position eitf no 
 which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf no 
to investments in securities that are impaired 
sumtotal systems is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of eitf no 
on its results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
factors that may affect future results of operations set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement 
we were delinquent in filing our annual report on form k and our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of fiscal year and received notification from nasdaq that our securities may be delisted if nasdaq determines we are not fully compliant with all of its listing requirements  which delisting could materially and adversely affect the liquidity and trading price of our common stock 
on march  we announced that we had determined that we were unable to render an assessment on our internal control over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act and as of that date we decided to expand the scope of our internal control review  improve our existing documentation and conduct additional testing 
on march   we filed a form b stating that we would not be able to file our form k for the year ended december  on april   we received notice from nasdaq stating that we were not in compliance with nasdaq s marketplace rule c  and thus our securities were subject to delisting because we had not yet filed our report on form k for our fiscal year ended december  we appealed this determination  and requested a hearing with a nasdaq panel  the outcome of which was an extension to august  to file our annual report on form k for fiscal year and our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of fiscal year if nasdaq determines that  after filing this form k and form q for the first quarter of fiscal year  we are not in compliance with all requirements for continued listing on nasdaq  then our securities may be delisted from nasdaq 
if our securities are delisted from nasdaq  the liquidity and trading price of our common stock would be materially and adversely affected 
we have a history of losses  we expect future losses on a gaap basis and we may never achieve gaap profitability 
we have not yet achieved profitability and may not do so 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 

table of contents we expect to derive substantially all of our revenue from the licensing of our new business performance and learning technology software family of products  the sumtotal series  as well as our legacy products  aspen learning management server and aspen learning content management server  docent learning management server and docent learning content management system legacy products sumtotal series and legacy products are hereinafter collectively called  sumtotal systems suite  and related services  including without limitation  maintenance  services and hosting 
we do not expect these product offerings to be sufficient to achieve gaap profitability 
commencing at the end of the fourth quarter and beginning the first quarter  we have begun our transition from our legacy products to the sumtotal series  and services related to these offerings 
if we fail to generate adequate revenues from the sumtotal systems suite and related services  we will continue to incur losses 
in addition  in the future  we expect to continue to incur additional non cash expenses relating to the amortization of deferred compensation and purchased intangible assets that will contribute to our net losses 
further  starting with the first fiscal quarter of  we will be required to charge the expense related to all stock options to the statements of operations in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payments  which was issued by fasb in december which will have the impact of increasing our reported gaap losses 
as a result of all of the foregoing  we expect to incur losses on a gaap basis for the foreseeable future  and may not  despite our forecast  achieve profitability on an operational basis 
failure to meet or exceed our forecasts or industry analysts projections could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our products in general  and our newly released product and its updates  the sumtotal series  contain defects  bugs and errors  known and unknown collectively  defects and  if the defects are material and we cannot fix such material defects in a timely fashion  we may need to halt further sales or shipments of our products  delay introduction of new products  and or experience warranty claims 
our product offerings  both current and future  like all software programs generally  are complex and often contain unknown and undetected errors or performance problems despite internal and third party testing 
new product offerings contain new features and functionality which result in a greater likelihood of defects 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial shipment of new products or enhancements to existing products 
although we attempted to discover and resolve all defects in our new product line that we believed would be considered serious by our customers before shipment to them  sumtotal series is not error free and some customers have notified us that they consider some of the defects in the sumtotal series to be serious 
nonetheless  we have to date  been able to address  or are addressing  such concerns through professional services or maintenance  although we cannot assure you that we will always be able to do so 
the defects  some of which were unknown to us  some that may yet to be discovered  and others that may manifest themselves in future releases of our product  could cause performance problems and result in material adverse financial consequences  including without limitation  delay in recognizing  declining or lost revenues  delay in customer acceptance  warranty claims  refund requests  or litigation claims for breach of contract or other claims 
we offer warranties for product and services to our customers 
although we have not experienced any material warranty claims and our historical return experiences have not been significant  past experience may not be indicative of increased future claims and returns 
in addition  although our agreements contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims  these provisions could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions  or by federal  state  local or foreign laws or regulations  requiring us to incur significant expense or pay substantial damages 
any of the above consequences could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  our reputation  or the market value of our common stock 
we may fail to successfully deploy sumtotal series on a timely basis  and we may suffer unexpected problems and delays in upgrades from our legacy products to sumtotal series  including delays caused by lack of resources in our professional services group 
sumtotal series  our new product  has required  and will continue to require  the expenditure of significant resources from all areas of our company 
in order to successfully market and sell the product  we must ensure broad based cooperation and coordination from multiple departments  including engineering and marketing  and from multiple geographic regions  including bellevue  washington  mountain view  california  and hyderabad  india 
our professional services group is new at deploying sumtotal series  and  although we believe we have made deployment timeframe estimations accurately  including estimates for upgrading our existing customer base from our legacy products to sumtotal series  there is no assurance that our operations group will be able to deploy sumtotal series in accordance with our estimates 
these failures may cause us to delay recognizing revenue and customers to delay or cancel purchasing decisions  thereby causing a decline in the price of our common stock 

table of contents any acquisition we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition if we are not able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or if expected benefits of the combination do not materialize 
we have made  and may continue to make  acquisitions and investments in order to enhance our business 
these type of transactions  if consummated  may potentially dilute our existing stockholders percentage ownership or decrease our cash balance 
in addition  some of our results may be negatively impacted due to certain purchase accounting rules that will result in a write down of deferred revenue and other purchase accounting adjustments 
additionally  we may need to restructure our business in order to achieve anticipated synergies 
these actions may result in restructuring charges  and  in addition  may cause uncertainty amongst our employees  which may result in the departure of certain key employees 
further  the failure to effectively manage the acquisition and integration of an acquired company could potentially disrupt our business and harm our financial results 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire 
the integration of businesses that we have acquired into our business has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
failure to operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and procedures and human resources practices could adversely impact the success of any business combination 
as a result of these activities  we may lose opportunities and employees  which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results 
our quarterly operating results are uncertain and may fluctuate significantly  which could negatively affect the value of your investment 
we have experienced substantial fluctuations in operating results  on a quarterly and annual basis and expect these fluctuations will continue in the future 
our operating results will be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to the size and timing of product orders and the timing and execution of professional services engagements for sumtotal series and the legacy products  the mix of revenue from products and services  the ability to meet client project milestones  the market acceptance of our products and services  especially sumtotal series and related services  increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  the timing of revenue and expense recognition  the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers  recognition of impairment of existing assets  and how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans 

table of contents our future revenue is difficult to predict and we may not be able to adjust spending in response to revenue shortfalls 
our limited operating history with our current business performance and learning management solutions and the rapidly evolving nature of the business performance and learning management market make prediction of future revenue and expenses difficult 
expense levels are based  in part  on expectations as to future revenue and largely are fixed in the short term 
other expenses  as a result of changes in the law or otherwise  such as expenses related to litigation or compliance with sarbanes oxley section  may also increase and cause us to fall short of our forecasts 
if we are unable to predict future revenue accurately  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  and may therefore fall short of our forecasts 
failure to meet our forecasts or industry analysts expectations would likely cause a decline in the price of our common stock 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price is subject to continued fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  compliance with sarbanes oxley and  in particular  section  including without limitation  the cost of identifying and remedying significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal controls  conditions or trends in business performance and learning management markets  announcements by us or our competitors of significant customer wins  technological innovations  new products or services  failure to accurately forecast sales of our software product  especially since we are reliant on the sales of a small number of relatively large orders  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  the seasonal fluctuations of our customers buying decisions  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our common stock  and general market conditions 
the stock market in general  and the market for enterprise software and technology companies in particular  recently has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of many of the affected companies 
these broad market and industry factors may depress our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
if our operating results were to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock would likely decrease significantly 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our common stock may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares above the price at which they purchased their shares 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation  like other litigation against us could result in substantial costs  negative publicity and divert our management s attention  which could seriously harm our business and stock price 

table of contents our recent stock performance may impair the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets 
our common stock has declined from per share on the first trading day following march  when the acquisition of docent was completed  to per share on july   providing us a total market capitalization of approximately million 
the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets on december  was million and million  respectively 
a further sustained decline in our stock price could trigger impairment of the carrying values of our goodwill and intangible assets and cause us to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of these assets to reflect their estimated fair values in future quarters 
we may be unable to successfully manage the product transition to sumtotal series and or subsequent releases 
we introduced sumtotal in late december  sumtotal in april  and plan to launch subsequent product releases over the next year 
we face numerous risks relating to product transitions  including customers delaying their purchasing decision until they have confidence in our new product and until we have proven we can successfully install and implement sumtotal series 
due to the product transition  we may be unable to accurately forecast revenue from product sales and related services  the number and severity of defects and increased support requirements due to the complexity of the new product 
if we fail to successfully manage the transition to this new product offering  our business and financial results may be adversely affected  which may cause a decline in the price of our common stock 
sales cycles are lengthy  requiring considerable additional investment with no assurance of generating revenue from our efforts 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and a customer s purchase of our products and services is lengthy  is getting longer  and often extends over several fiscal quarters or a fiscal year 
to sell our products and services successfully  we generally must educate our potential customers regarding the use and benefits of our products and services  which typically requires significant time  capital and other resources 
the delay or failure to complete sales in a particular quarter could reduce our revenue in that quarter  as well as subsequent quarters over which revenue for the sale would likely be recognized 
if the sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general or for one or more large orders  it would negatively affect the timing of our revenue  and our revenue growth would be harmed 
many of our potential customers are large enterprises that generally take longer than smaller organizations to make significant business decisions 
in addition  although we must expend and allocate resources prior to completing a sales transaction  we may never generate any revenue from these activities 
moreover  our revenue will be subject to fluctuation as a result of general economic conditions and overall spending in the technology and enterprise software sectors 
a weakening economy could result in organizations further delaying  canceling  or reducing capital expenditures generally and spending on enterprise software applications in particular 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of products and services to large companies or government agencies  which historically have reduced their expenditures for enterprise software applications during economic downturns 
there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures that could impact our financial reporting and result in us failing to meet our financial projections 
our management  including  without limitation  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived or operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
the design of our control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints 
further  the benefits of such controls were considered relative to their costs  and the company  based on its size  has had to make decisions not to establish and implement certain controls and procedures we may otherwise have established  because of the cost 
because of the inherent limitations of all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls and procedures can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of a control or procedure 
the design of any system of controls and procedures is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
in such event  we may not be able to recognize revenue we thought we could  we may not be able to meet our forecasts or industry analysts projections  or we may be the subject of litigation  each of which would likely result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

table of contents standards for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of are burdensome and uncertain  and if we fail to comply in a timely manner  our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our management is required to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal controls over financial reporting are new and complex  and require significant documentation  testing and possible remediation 
the process of reviewing  documenting and testing our internal controls over financial reporting will likely continue to result in increased expenses and the devotion of significant management and other internal resources 
as we have in connection with  we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting 
during this process  if we are unable to effectively remediate our material weaknesses  or if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective 
section compliance is relatively new  and we were not able to comply with the requirements of section for fiscal year on a timely basis 
we have numerous material weaknesses  and have extensive remediation plans and requirements  not all of which have been developed  or  if developed  implemented 
there is no assurance that our remediation plans  both those developed  as well as those yet to be developed  will effectively address the material weaknesses  or that such changes in our control procedures will not create other material weaknesses 
if our management is unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our auditors are unable to attest that our management report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we may not be able to timely file  or file at all  our periodic financial reports  and thus we will be subject to delisting 
even if we are able to file such reports  investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports may be lost  and this would have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations have increased  and are likely to continue to increase  our expenses 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  have increased  and will continue to increase  our expenses as we devote resources to respond to the new requirements 
the sarbanes oxley act mandates  among other things  that companies adopt new corporate governance measures  and it imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members  and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers  chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
in particular  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  additional administrative expense as we implement sarbanes oxley section  which requires management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls 
in addition  the nasdaq national market  on which our common stock is listed  has also adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope  complexity and cost of our corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  which could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
further  our directors and executive officers could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified directors and executive officers  which could adversely affect our business 
our business may not generate the cash needed to finance our operations or growth  and for that and other reasons we may need additional financing in the future  which we may be unable to obtain 
if our business does not generate the cash needed to finance our operations or growth  including potential business acquisitions  we may need to obtain additional financing or take steps to restrict our operations in order to conserve existing cash 
in addition  poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could give rise to additional financing requirements 
we may be unable to obtain financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we need to obtain financing and adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be required to make further expense reductions  which could significantly restrict our operations and limit our ability to enhance our products  fund expansion  respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of business opportunities 

table of contents acquisitions or investments may drain capital and equity resources  divert management s attention or otherwise harm our business 
in the future we may acquire or make investments in other businesses  products or technologies 
such acquisitions or investments may require that we pay significant cash  issue stock or incur substantial debt 
such acquisitions or investments may result in the loss of key personnel and the dilution of existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities 
in addition  such acquisitions or investments may require significant managerial attention  which may be diverted from our other operations 
these capital  equity and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our business 
furthermore  acquired businesses may not be effectively integrated  may be unable to maintain key pre acquisition business relationships  may contribute to increased fixed costs and may expose us to unanticipated liabilities 
acquisitions and mergers of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that future acquisitions  if any  will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or operating condition 
our revenue may grow more slowly than we previously forecasted 
if our revenue does not increase at or above the rate we have forecasted or the financial analysts expect  the price of our common stock may decline 
our future growth rates will depend on general economic conditions and on our ability to expand sales of our existing products and develop and market new products  which will require significant expenses that we may not have sufficient resources to undertake 
we have a limited operating history on which to evaluate our current business and future prospects 
the lack of any operating history with the sumtotal series makes it difficult to predict our future performance and may not provide investors with a meaningful basis for evaluating an investment in our common stock 
implementation of sfas no 
r  share based payment in the first fiscal quarter of will negatively impact our operating results 
we are currently required to record stock based compensation charges only if the employee s stock option exercise price is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the grant or measurement date  and in such event  we would record a charge only for the difference between the grant price and the deemed fair value 
however  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our espp 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the effective date of the new standard for our consolidated financial statements is the first fiscal quarter of upon adoption  this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under the espp rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net loss within the footnotes as is our current practice found in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts disclosed within the footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
compensation expense calculated under sfas no 
r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within the footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options 

table of contents on may   our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share previously awarded to our employees  including our section officers  under each of our equity compensation plans 
this approval was based on a recommendation of the compensation committee of the board of directors  which consists entirely of independent directors  and reflects an approximate premium over the average closing price of our common stock over the ninety day period prior to its determination 
the acceleration of vesting was effective for stock options outstanding as of may  options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock  or of our outstanding unvested options   of which are held by section officers  will become exercisable upon our compliance with nasdaq and sec rules 
the purpose of the acceleration is to enable us to avoid recognizing the future compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r  when effective  will require all share based payments to employees  including granting of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense on our consolidated statement of operations  rather than as a disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  based on their fair values 
sfas no 
r will become effective to us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the pre tax charge to be avoided amounts to approximately million over the course of the remainder of the original vesting periods  which  on average  is approximately years from january  the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on generally accepted accounting principles because there was not a modification of the option grants 
we also believe that because the options to be accelerated have exercise prices in excess of the current market value of the our common stock  the options have limited economic value and are not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention 
however  as a result of the acceleration  we will lose the retention value of the unvested options  and as a result  certain key employees may leave 
we face intense competition from other business performance and learning management software providers including saba software  inc  plateau systems ltd  international business machines corporation and pathlore software corporation  as well as other enterprise software vendors such as sap ag  oracle corporation and siebel systems  inc  and we may be unable to compete successfully 
the business performance and learning management software market is highly fragmented and competitive  with no single company accounting for a dominant share of the market 
our competitors vary in size  scope and the breadth of products and services offered 
we will face competition from other developers of business performance and learning technology systems  providers of other business performance and learning technology solutions  large professional consulting firms and in house information technology departments  and developers of web authoring tools 
there are relatively low barriers to entry in the business performance and learning technology market  and new competitors may enter this market in the future 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share 
our principal competitors are saba software  inc  plateau systems ltd  international business machines corporation  pathlore software corporation  sap ag  oracle corporation and siebel systems  inc we may lose business  as well as market share  due to increased competition 
in particular  vendors of other enterprise software applications such as enterprise resource planning  human resource management or customer relationship management have begun to offer learning delivery and management functionality to extend their current product lines 
although these vendors offerings may not offer the same functionality as our products  bundling these offerings with the remainder of their solutions could diminish our ability to sell our products and services to their customers or other prospects 
announcements by these companies of future products could delay purchasing decisions by their customers and our prospects 
either diminished sales or delayed purchases could adversely affect our business 
certain of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and therefore may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards and customer requirements or to compete more aggressively on pricing 
price competition would likely result in reduced gross margins and may prevent our products from yielding results sufficient for our business to succeed 

table of contents strategic relationships are important in expanding the distribution reach of companies in the business performance and learning technology market 
if competitors establish strategic relationships to resell or distribute their products through their strategic partners  our ability to market and sell products and services successfully may be substantially diminished 
in addition  the existence or announcement of strategic relationships involving competitors could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 
there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in the software market for several years 
we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations 
we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole source vendors for customers 
this could lead to more variability in operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
furthermore  rapid consolidation may lead to fewer customers  with the effect that loss of major customers could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 
a substantial amount of our engineering activities are based in hyderabad  india and are subject to contingencies and delays that aren t typically experienced with stateside engineering efforts  and our indian office  along with our washington office  must be well integrated 
we have an increasing reliance on our engineering operations in hyderabad  india to enable us to complete customer implementation projects and new releases of our products on time and within our established budgets 
should our operations in hyderabad be disrupted for any significant period of time  it could prevent us from completing customer implementations or new releases of our product offerings in a timely manner  which could cause our business to suffer 
our efforts in hyderabad and elsewhere abroad are subject to a number of risks inherent in international operations  including diversion of management attention  difficulties and costs of recruiting and retaining qualified engineers and other personnel in our foreign offices  different learning styles and cultures  intense and increasing competition from other technology companies with regard to hiring and retaining qualified personnel  increasing growth and development of the technology market in india generally  and in hyderabad specifically  increasing competition and costs of hiring and retaining qualified personnel  numerous and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements  export controls  import tariffs and other barriers to trade  changes in laws or governmental policies  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  regional political and economic instability  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
if our indian or other overseas operations fail  for any reason  to provide adequate and timely product enhancements  updates and fixes to us  our ability to fix defects in our sumtotal series  our ability to develop new versions of our sumtotal series  and our ability to respond to customer or competitive demands would be harmed and we would lose sales opportunities and customers 
in addition  we plan to have our engineering efforts based primarily out of two offices bellevue  washington and hyderabad  india 
if we fail to successfully staff either of these offices  or fail to ensure that these two offices work together  then we may experience delays in fixing defects in sumtotal series or in developing and releasing future versions of our product 
in such event  our business and financial results may be adversely impacted and could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 

table of contents we are facing significant resource constraints in our professional services group 
the revenue from our professional services group is growing  and is becoming an increasing percentage of our total revenue 
for instance  in fiscal year  professional services consulting revenue was approximately of our overall revenue 
at times  the demand for our professional services exceeds our available resources 
even if we are successful in recruiting additional professional services personnel  which we cannot guarantee we will be  it will take time for the new personnel to become familiar with our products and to integrate into our company 
as such  we may not be able to meet customer demands  thereby causing potential delays in  or adverse decisions in  purchasing decisions or upgrade challenges  causing customer dissatisfaction and potential warranty or breach of contract claims 
each of these may result in a decline in revenue and or stock price 
the business performance and learning management software market may not grow to a sufficient size or at a sufficient rate to sustain our business 
corporate training and education historically have been conducted primarily through classroom instruction 
although technology based training applications have been available for many years  they currently account for only a small portion of the overall corporate learning market 
accordingly  our success will depend on the extent to which companies implement business performance and learning management software solutions for the design  development  delivery and management of their corporate learning needs 
many companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional training methods may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy that may limit or compete with their existing investments 
even if companies implement business performance and learning management software solutions  they may still choose to develop such solutions internally 
if the use of business performance and learning management software does not become widespread or if companies choose to develop such software internally rather than acquiring it from third parties  then our business performance and learning management software may not be commercially successful 
we outsource some of the management and maintenance of our hosted and asp solutions to third parties and will depend on them to provide adequate management and maintenance services 
we rely on third parties to provide key components of our networks and systems 
for instance  we rely on third party internet service providers to host our sumtotal systems suite for customers who desire to have these solutions hosted 
we also rely on third party communications service providers for the high speed connections that link our and our internet service providers web servers and office systems to the internet 
any internet or communications systems failure or interruption could result in disruption of our service or loss or compromise of customer orders and data 
these failures  especially if they are prolonged or repeated  would make our services less attractive to customers  may subject us to customer liability  or may tarnish our reputation  thereby causing a decrease in our revenue and an accompanying decline in the price of our common stock 
we face risks encountered in rapidly evolving markets and may be unsuccessful in addressing these risks 
we face risks frequently encountered in rapidly evolving markets 
specific risks we face relate to the demand for and market acceptance of our business performance and learning technology solutions including the risk that our new product suite  the sumtotal series  just recently introduced to the market  will fail to achieve market acceptance 
we may fail to adequately address these risks  and therefore our business may suffer 
to address these risks  we must effectively market our business performance and learning technology software to new and existing customers  continue to enhance the technology upon which our business performance and learning technology software is based  successfully implement our business performance and learning technology software for our customers and generate continuing revenue from those customers  and address and establish new technologies and technology standards 

table of contents international operations may impose substantial burdens on our resources  divert management s attention or otherwise harm our business 
we rely on independent partners in many foreign countries to help conduct our international operations and sales and marketing efforts 
our success in international markets consequently will depend to a large degree on the success of these independent partners  over which we have little control 
if they are unwilling or unable to dedicate sufficient resources to our relationships  our international operations will suffer 
the operations of these partners are based outside the us and therefore subject to risks distinct from those that face us based operations 
conducting business outside of the us is subject to certain risks  including military action or political upheaval in the host countries could force these partners to terminate the services they are providing to us or to close their operations entirely  social unrest or disturbances  the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  language barriers  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  fluctuating exchange rates  and price controls and other restrictions on foreign currency 
in addition  based on our limited history of working with these partners  we cannot be sure that our cost estimates will prove correct 
unanticipated increases in our operating expenses in any given quarter would increase our net losses and could require us to obtain additional financing sooner than expected 
economic  political and market conditions can adversely affect our revenue growth 
there are increasing signs of an improving economic environment 
however  it may be too early to determine whether an economic recovery will be broad  substantial and sustained  and whether any such recovery would translate to sustained higher levels of information technology spending 
if demand for our software and related services does not continue to strengthen  our revenue growth rates for new software licenses and  to a lesser extent  our revenue growth rates for software license updates and professional services will be adversely affected 
in addition  the war on terrorism and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue growth and results 
although our business depends materially on the condition of domestic and foreign economies  our management has no competitive advantage in forecasting macroeconomic trends and developments relating to these general business conditions 
our management is  however  required to make forecasts in order to develop budgets  plan research and development strategies and perform a wide variety of general management functions 
to the extent that our forecasts are in error  because we are either overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about the performance of an economy  our performance can suffer because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions 
international laws and regulations may expose us to potential costs and litigation 
our international operations increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our products and services or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may impose tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult and costly for us to conduct our business 

table of contents we will need to expand sales through distributors  alliance partners  value added resellers and systems integrators in order to develop our business and increase revenue 
we expect to increasingly rely on distributors  alliance partners  value added resellers  and systems integrators for the distribution and sale of our branded products globally 
our strategy contemplates the expansion of our distributor and reseller network both domestically and internationally 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract  train and motivate new distributors and resellers and expand our relationships with current distributors and resellers 
we may not be successful in expanding our distributor and reseller relationships  and our sales would suffer as a result 
further  we will be required to invest significant additional resources in order to expand these relationships  and the cost of this investment may exceed the margins generated from this investment 
the loss of the services of our senior executives and key personnel would likely cause our business to suffer 
our success depends to a significant degree on the performance of the senior management team and other key employees 
the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 
we do not have employment agreements with our executives or with any other key employee  and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any officer or key employee 
our success also depends on our ability to attract  integrate  motivate and retain highly skilled technical  sales and marketing and professional services personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the software industry  particularly engineering and other technical personnel  is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain highly skilled employees in sufficient numbers to sustain our current business or to support future growth 
our lack of product diversification  and our reliance on the sumtotal systems suite  means that any decline in price or demand for our products and services would seriously harm our business 
our sumtotal systems suite and our new product  sumtotal series and successor products and related services are expected to account for a significant majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
consequently  a decline in the price of  or demand for  the sumtotal systems suite and successor products or services  or their failure to achieve broad market acceptance  would seriously harm our business and would likely result in the decline of our common stock 
we may not be able to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards and if  as a result  our products become obsolete or there is a delay in meeting our customer needs  we would lose market share 
the business performance and learning management software market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product and service introductions  short development cycles and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of new products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our products and services obsolete 
our success depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape and to offer new products and services to address our customers changing demands 
we may experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful design  development  introduction or marketing of our products and services 
to the extent we in fact experience such delays  we may experience difficulty in attracting new customers and may lose existing customers 
rapid change will require us to manage the size of our employee base  particularly our direct sales force and global support staff 
the majority of our expenses are personnel related costs such as employee compensation and benefits  along with the cost of the infrastructure occupancy and equipment to support our employee base 
the failure to adjust our employee base  particularly our direct sales force and technical and global services staff  to the appropriate level to support our revenues could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  expanding the distribution of our products may place new and increased demands on our direct sales force and technical and sales support staff 
although we believe that we currently are investing sufficient resources in our direct sales force and our technical and global services staff  there are only a limited number of qualified personnel in these areas 
our ability to achieve expanded distribution and revenue growth in the future will depend  in part  on our success in retaining and in recruiting and training sufficient direct sales  technical and global services personnel 
we may not be able to expand our direct sales force and technical support staff as necessary to support our operations and maintain or increase our market share 

table of contents we face the risk of liability for failures to meet unique customer requirements  and the risk of cost overruns on fixed price projects 
the failure or inability to meet a customer s unique expectations or requirements for our products or in the performance of services could impair our reputation or result in a claim for damages  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
although generally we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from defects and other mistakes in rendering professional services  these contractual protections are not always obtained and may not be enforced or otherwise may not protect us from liability 
our insurance may not be sufficient to cover these claims or may not even cover these claims 
in addition  some of our professional services projects are performed on a fixed price basis rather than on a time and materials basis 
if we do not complete fixed price engagements within budget  on time and to clients satisfaction  we bear the risk of cost overruns 
market acceptance of new platforms and operating environments may require us to undergo the expense of developing and maintaining compatible product lines 
although our software products can be licensed for use with a variety of popular industry standard relational database management system platforms  there may be existing or future platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace which may not be architecturally compatible with our software product design 
moreover  existing or future user interfaces that achieve popularity within the business application marketplace may or may not be architecturally compatible with our current software product design 
developing and maintaining consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules  which could adversely affect revenue and results of operations 
to maintain software performance across accepted platforms and operating environments  to achieve market acceptance of those that we support  or to adapt to popular new ones  our expenses may increase and our sales and revenues may be adversely affected 
our disaster recovery plan does not include redundant back up computer systems  and a disaster could severely damage our operations 
our disaster recovery plan does not include redundant back up computer systems at an alternate site 
a disaster could severely harm our business because our computer systems could be interrupted for an indeterminate length of time 
our operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect the computer systems needed for our day to day operations 
a number of these computer systems are located in silicon valley on or near known earthquake fault zones and flood plains 
although these systems are designed to be fault tolerant  they are vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and other events 
any damage to our facility could lead to interruptions in the services we provide to our customers and loss of customer information  and could substantially if not totally impair our ability to operate our business 
the business interruption insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
terrorism and the declaration of war by the us against terrorism and other possible us military actions may adversely affect our business 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the us on september   the potential for future terrorist attacks in the us  the declaration of war by the us against terrorism  the terrorist attack in the us on july   the military actions in afghanistan and iraq and other existing and possible us military actions have created significant instability and uncertainty in the world which may continue to have a material adverse effect on world financial markets  including financial markets in the us in addition  such adverse political events may have an adverse impact on economic conditions in the us unfavorable economic conditions in the us may have an adverse effect on our business operations including  but not limited to  our ability to expand the market for our products  obtain financing as needed  enter into strategic relationships and effectively compete in the business performance and learning management market 
security and privacy breaches could subject us to litigation and liability 
we host certain of our customers business performance and learning management software implementations and provide access to that software using the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers  which could disrupt the operation of our hosting systems or make them inaccessible to users 
we depend on internet service providers and telecommunications companies and the efficient operation of their computer networks and other computer equipment to enable customers to access and use hosted software implementations 
each of these partners has experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems  which could cause our customers to believe we were at fault and withhold payments due to us 

table of contents we could become subject to litigation and liability if third parties penetrate security for our hosting systems or otherwise misappropriate our users confidential information  or if customers are unable to access and use hosted software implementations 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other technological events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or service interruptions or to alleviate problems caused by breaches or service interruptions 
our intellectual property is subject to  and may be subject to  additional legal challenges or unauthorized use or claims of infringement  any of which could diminish the value of our products and services or deter customers from purchasing our products 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trade secret and trademark laws  contractual restrictions  restrictions on disclosure and other methods to protect our proprietary technology 
these legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology 
we hold only two issued patents underlying the products developed by docent prior to the merger of docent and clicklearn  and do not hold patents for any of the technology underlying clicklearn s legacy aspen product offering  nor any patents for sumtotal series 
furthermore  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
it may also be possible for third parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade secrets without our authorization  and it may be possible for third parties to independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products and services or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
consequently the value of our products and services to our customers could diminish substantially 
both docent and clicklearn have been the subject of patent infringement cases 
in may  iplearn  llc filed suit against docent and several other major developers of online learning software  alleging five patent infringement claims related to online learning and seeks unspecified damages 
in december  ip innovation filed suit against docent and seven other defendants  alleging infringement of a patent covering the use of html hypertext markup language in graphics software used in a computer system and seeks unspecified damages 
in july  docent won its summary judgment motion for non infringement  though ip innovation has appealed that decision 
in february  iplearn  llc filed suit against clicklearn alleging that its legacy aspen product line infringes eight patents held by iplearn 
the iplearn suits against docent and clicklearn have been consolidated into one suit against sumtotal systems 
in each of these cases  plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief 
after investigating and analyzing the claims  we believe that each of the cases is without merit  and we are defending  and plan to continue to defend  against each of them vigorously 
nonetheless  patent infringement claims are expensive to defend and divert management attention from operating our business 
in addition  even though we may prevail initially in any particular case  as we experienced in the ip innovation case  such matter may be subject to appeal by plaintiff and may subject us to time consuming and costly delays in final resolution of a particular case 
in the event it is in fact determined that docent or clicklearn were  or we are  infringing the patents that are the subject of any of these claims or other third party patents  we may be required to cease shipping  to pay damages  to license technology on terms that may not be favorable to us or to alter our technology  website or software products  any of which may adversely affect our operating results and cause us to meet our forecasts or industry analysts forecasts  thereby causing a possible decline in the price of our common stock 
in addition  from time to time  we have received  and may in the future receive  notice of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
such claims could result in costly litigation and could divert management and technical resources 
they could also delay product shipment or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which agreements may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 

table of contents our products include third party technology  the loss of which could materially harm our business 
errors in this third party software or our inability to continue to license this software in the future could increase our costs and decrease our revenue 
we use some licensed third party technology components in our products 
future licenses to this technology may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the loss of or inability to obtain or maintain any of these technology licenses could result in delays in the introduction of new products or could force us to discontinue offering portions of our business performance and learning management solutions until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
the operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third party software that we incorporate  and we may incur additional costs to repair or replace the defective software 
it may be difficult for us to correct any errors in third party software because the software is not within our control 
accordingly  our revenue could decrease and our costs could increase in the event of any errors in this technology 
furthermore  we may become subject to legal claims related to licensed technology based on product liability  infringement of intellectual property or other legal theories 
we may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that could result in liability or increase the cost of doing business  thereby adversely affecting our financial results 
we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any domestic or foreign governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  such as export control laws and laws or regulations directly applicable to internet commerce 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may become applicable to us or may be adopted in the future with respect to the internet covering issues such as taxation  user privacy  content  right to access personal data  copyrights  distribution and characteristics and quality of services 
the applicability of existing laws governing issues such as taxation  property ownership  copyrights  and other intellectual property issues  encryption  libel  export or import matters and personal privacy to the internet is uncertain 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the broad commercial use of the internet and related technologies 
as a result  they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to these laws  including some recently proposed changes  could create uncertainty in the internet marketplace 
such uncertainty could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased costs of litigation or increased service delivery costs 
in addition  we could be liable for the misuse of personal information 
the federal trade commission  the european union and certain state and local authorities have been investigating certain internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
we could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if these authorities choose to investigate our privacy practices 
anti takeover provisions could make the sale of the company more difficult 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  no potential acquirer would be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors 
a potential acquirer would also not be able to act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms that make it difficult to remove all directors at once 
the acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to remove directors at an annual meeting 
the acquirer would not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting  which would require the acquirer to hold more shares to gain representation on our board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted 
subject to our fiduciary duties  our board of directors may in the future adopt a stockholder rights plan 
if the board adopts a stockholder rights plan  it may discourage a merger or tender offer involving our securities that is not approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on stockholders who may want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law limits business combination transactions with stockholders that have not been approved by the issuer s board of directors 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult or impossible for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market rate risk 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents interest rate risk 
we hold our assets primarily in cash and cash equivalents  such as short term marketable debt securities  money market funds and other cash equivalents and short term investments such as commercial paper  publicly traded common stock and treasury notes 
we minimize risk by investing in financial instruments with original maturities of less than one year 
as a result  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments would not change by a material amount 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we have foreign currency risk as a result of foreign subsidiary activities 
for the years ended december   and  international revenue from our foreign subsidiaries accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenue 
all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the us are charged to the foreign subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the us we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated in us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for the year ended december  was not material 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
we have not entered into any forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event that our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures in the future
