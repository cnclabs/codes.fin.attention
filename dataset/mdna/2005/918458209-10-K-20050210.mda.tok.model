overview we supply end to end broadband access solutions used by telecommunications providers to deliver both circuit switched services  such as telephony and t e connections  and internet protocol ip services  such as high speed data and voice over ip connections  to business and residential subscribers 
our technology uses point to multipoint architecture to deliver services over wireless media or cable television networks 
we sell our systems to system integrators  distributors and directly to service providers 
we have two business segments 
the fixed broadband wireless segment supplies broadband wireless access systems used by telecommunications service providers to deliver wireless  high speed data and voice connections to business and residential subscribers 
the cable segment represents the results of xtend s operations  which were consolidated commencing july  xtend  which is a development stage company  provides infrastructure solutions that expand the bandwidth of cable television lines 
starting in  we believed new opportunities might develop for our traditional wireless products and began to dedicate additional resources to sales in international markets  particularly china 
these opportunities  however  are developing slowly and the pricing environment is very competitive 
if our sales do not substantially increase from current levels  we will continue to incur losses  and may never achieve profitability 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
on june   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of xtend networks ltd 
and its wholly owned  us based subsidiary  xtend networks  inc collectively  xtend 
xtend provides infrastructure solutions that expand the bandwidth of cable television lines 
xtend is based in tel aviv  israel and has an office in atlanta  georgia 
xtend has never been profitable and  as it is in a development stage  to date it has not generated any revenues 
the results of xtend s operations were consolidated with vyyo s operations commencing july  the acquisition of xtend  which is currently operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of xtend cable solutions inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of vyyo inc  is intended to diversify our business and to seek to open new markets for our current products 
in connection with the transaction we issued  shares of vyyo s common stock and made cash payments of approximately  for non competition agreements from certain employees of xtend  vyyo provided a contingent promissory note contingent note in the principal amount of million payable on march  in the event that the consolidated revenues of vyyo in the year ended december  equal or exceed million and the consolidated gross margin of vyyo equals or exceeds during the same period  the contingent note shall be canceled 
the contingent note is subject to acceleration in the event that the excess sum of the company s cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable  net of the sum of the company s long term and short term liabilities exclusive of the contingent note is less than million on december  or on june   vyyo agreed to pay a contingent cash bonus to an xtend employee in the amount of approximately million and granted the same employee  restricted shares  of which  shares vested over a six month period and compensation expenses were recorded see note and  shares will vest subject to designated performance criteria 
the contingent cash bonus was resolved and a provision was recorded in selling and marketing expenses on september   
table of contents 
index to financial statements vyyo agreed to make cash payments to certain other xtend option holders and xtend employees in connection with those parties outstanding options in xtend 
these cash payments include a payment of approximately  paid in cash at the closing of the transaction on june  and a payment of approximately  which is expected to be paid over two years upon realization of certain employment conditions  vyyo committed to contribute to xtend up to million  to be contributed in stages based on the operational needs of xtend  and vyyo incurred direct expenses related to the transaction amounting to  which were capitalized as a part of the investment of xtend 
as xtend is a development stage enterprise that has not yet commenced its planned principal operations  we accounted for the transaction as an acquisition of net assets pursuant to the provisions of sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their relative fair values  and no goodwill was recorded 
the purchase price consisted of in thousands value of vyyo s shares non competition cash payments other cash payments to option holders and employees acquisition direct costs total purchase price this valuation was based on the vyyo s average share price of  based on the average closing prices from may  to may  and including two trading days prior to and two trading days subsequent to the public announcement of the transaction 
the tangible and intangible net assets acquired consisted of the following in thousands tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed cash and cash equivalents other current assets property and equipment  net current liabilities total net tangible assets acquired intangible assets acquired existing technology in process research and development non competition agreements exclusive sales agreement workforce total intangible assets acquired total tangible and intangible net assets acquired the fair value of the intangible assets acquired was estimated by a third party appraiser  based upon future expected discounted cash flows

accordingly  they were charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition 
intangible assets acquired are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as follows existing technology over six years  non competition agreements over approximately three years  an exclusive sales agreement over four and one a half years and workforce over one year 
amortization of intangible assets acquired for the year ended december  was  consisting of the amortization of existing technology of  non competition agreements amounting to  an exclusive sales agreement amounting to  and workforce amounting to  estimated future amortization expenses of intangible assets for the following years  subsequent to december  are as follows in thousands we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial conditions and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumption and conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
revenues from our fixed broadband wireless segment are derived from sales of products 
we currently provide no services 
our products consist of hubs and modems  which are off the shelf products  sold as is  without further adjustment or installation 
these products are usually sold individually at a standard fixed price determined by us 
when establishing a relationship with a new customer  we may also sell these products together as a package  in which case these products are shipped at the same time to the customer 
as our products are off the shelf products  we do not provide our customers with the right of return or any additional services after delivery except for standard product warranty 

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenues from our products are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and customer acceptance requirements have been met  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of payment is reasonably assured and we have no additional obligations 
emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables addresses the accounting  by a vendor  for contractual arrangements in which multiple revenue generating activities will be performed by the vendor 
it is effective prospectively for all arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  eitf issue addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
our multiple deliverables arrangements are those arrangements with new customers in which our products are sold together as a package 
because these off the shelf products are delivered at the same time and the four revenue recognition criteria are met at that time  the adoption of eitf had no impact on our financial position and results of operations 
products warranty 
we accrue for product warranty costs upon recognition of product revenues 
the provision is calculated as a percentage of the sales based on historical experience 
short term investments 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial health of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse effect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary 
if market  industry and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories 
cost includes labor and material for finished goods and work in process 
we estimate average selling prices for our products based on current selling prices  estimates of demands for our products  general economic trends and other information 
estimating these average selling prices is a highly subjective process 
we determine expected inventory usage based on demand forecasts 
inventory reserves are established based on forecasted demand  past experience with the specific customers and the ability to redistribute inventory to other customers 
intangible assets 
the acquisition of xtend has generated significant amounts of intangible assets  which consist mainly of technology  non competition agreements  an exclusive sales agreement and workforce 
these definitive life intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated periods of useful lives  ranging between one and six years 
this valuation of the fair value of these intangible assets acquired was performed by qualified independent appraisers  based on the estimated expected discounted cash flows  and will be subject to future impairment tests 
acquired research and development in process 
acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility are capitalized as intangible assets  since it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits 
acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition 
stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas 
this statement amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  providing alternative methods of voluntarily transitioning to the fair market value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation

this statement eliminates the ability to account for employee share based payment transactions using apb no 
and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using the grant date fair value based method 
this statement will be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  july  for the company 
we are currently considering early adoption of fas r as of january  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

as of december   through open market transactions  we repurchased  shares under the repurchase program for a total of million 
we did not repurchase any shares under the repurchase program in  or our liquidity will be impacted to some extent by the amount of share repurchases  if any  made under the repurchase program in the future 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing additional international operations and other factors 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to cancel or suspend our stock repurchase program  sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit arrangements 
additional financing may not be available on terms

we expect to devote substantial capital resources to search for  investigate and  potentially  acquire new businesses  companies or technologies 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders

our israeli subsidiaries the subsidiaries have been granted approved enterprise status for several investment programs 
these programs entitle the israeli subsidiary to tax exemption periods from two to six years on undistributed earnings derived from an approved enterprise  commencing in the year in which it attains taxable income and a reduced corporate tax rate of for the remaining term of the program on the plan s proportionate share of income 
since the subsidiaries have not achieved taxable income  the tax benefits periods has not yet commenced 
the subsidiaries losses are expected to offset certain future earnings of the subsidiary during the tax exempt period 
therefore  the utilization of the net operating losses will generate no tax benefits 
since the subsidiaries have not achieved taxable income  the tax benefits periods have not yet commenced 
the subsidiaries losses are expected to offset certain future earnings of the subsidiaries during the tax exempt period  therefore  the utilization of the net operating losses will generate no tax benefits 
accordingly deferred tax assets from such losses have not been included in the financial statements 
the entitlement to the above benefits is conditional upon the subsidiaries fulfilling the conditions stipulated by the law  regulations published thereunder and the instruments of approval for the specific investments in approved enterprises 
on january   the israeli law for amendment of the income tax ordinance amendment no 
  as amended  known as the tax reform  came into effect 
the tax reform is aimed at broadening the categories of taxable income and reducing the tax rates imposed on employment income 
pursuant to these reforms  we have chosen  with respect to stock options granted under vyyo inc s second amended and restated employee and consultant equity incentive plan the plan  to grant to employees and office holders nosei missra of our subsidiaries who are israeli tax residents  in each case excluding controlling shareholders as such term is defined in section of the israeli income tax ordinance  options without a trustee intermediary 
this permits such employees and office holders  pursuant to the terms of the plan  to exercise their stock options and sell their shares without the holding period requirements and other restrictions imposed in the case of options granted through a trustee intermediary 
in the absence of a trustee intermediary  the tax reform generally permits such employees and office holders to recognize ordinary income at the time the employee actually sells the shares  rather than on the date of grant or exercise  but precludes us from deducting the resulting expense for tax purposes at any time

vyyo inc and xtend have a history of losses  expect future losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred losses of approximately million in the year ended december  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
in addition  we recently increased our sales and marketing expenditures and research and development expenditures in connection with our efforts to develop new sources of revenue 
our revenues and gross margins may not grow or even continue at their current level and may decline even further 
our gross margins have been favorably affected by sales of inventory that were previously written off 
if our revenues do not rapidly increase  or if our expenses increase at a greater pace than our revenues  we will never become profitable 
if the adoption of broadband wireless technology continues to be limited  we will not be able to sustain our business 
our future success in the telecommunications business depends on high speed wireless communications products gaining market acceptance as a means to provide voice and data communications services 
because these markets are relatively new and unproven  it is difficult to predict if these markets will ever develop  expand or be sufficiently large to sustain our business 
major service providers in the united states have ceased  delayed or reduced their rollouts and may further delay or reduce rollouts in the future 
our expectations with respect to a recovery  if any  in the telecommunications market  may not prove accurate 
in the event that service providers adopt technologies other than the wireless technologies that we offer or if they delay further their deployment of high speed wireless communication products  we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 
while we are continuing to operate our traditional fixed broadband wireless business and have increased our sales and marketing efforts and research and development efforts to address the china market and other new markets  we are also considering a variety of alternatives to this business  including the sale  divestiture  license or restructuring of a substantial portion or all of our current fixed wireless broadband technology or assets 
in the event of any such transaction  the value we may realize in the current market could be minimal 
xtend s success will depend on the cable industry s willingness and ability to substantially increase the available bandwidth on their networks using xtend s alternative technology solution 
for our products to be sold in significant quantities  cable television operators msos must be willing and able to substantially increase the available bandwidth on their networks 
msos may not be willing or able to develop additional services and revenues streams to justify the deployment of xtend s technology 
meanwhile  major msos have indicated that the imminent completion of significant network upgrades  which involve significant labor and construction costs  will lead to lower capital expenditures in the future 
msos such as adelphia communications have been in bankruptcy proceedings 
if our product portfolio and product development plans do not position us well to capture an increased portion of the expected reduced capital spending of these cable operators  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  specific factors contributing to lower capital spending in the cable industry have included uncertainty and delay relating to the development of digital video and cable modem industry standards  delays in the evaluation of new services and system architectures by many cable television operations  proposed business combinations  restructurings and bankruptcies by major cable television operators and the related regulatory review and or legal obstacles  and a focus on generating revenue from existing customers rather than network upgrades 

table of contents 
index to financial statements xtend s technology may differ materially from the major msos technology plans 
because the major msos tend to make similar decisions regarding their technology roadmaps  a decision by a few operators  or even one operator  to proceed in a direction different from that proposed by xtend may significantly limit the commercial potential of xtend s products 
if telecommunications service providers and systems integrators do not promote and purchase our products  or if the telecommunications equipment market continues not to improve and grow  our business will seriously be harmed 
telecommunications service providers continually evaluate alternative technologies  including digital subscriber line  fiber and cable 
should service providers or systems integrators  to which we may sell products in the future  cease to emphasize systems that include our products  choose to emphasize alternative technologies or promote systems of our competitors  our business would be seriously harmed 
market conditions remain difficult and capital spending plans are often constrained 
it is likely that further industry restructuring and consolidation will take place 
companies that have historically not had a large presence in the broadband access equipment market have begun recently to expand their market share through mergers and acquisitions 
the continued consolidation of our competitors could have a significant negative impact on us 
further  our competitors may bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products or which may require us to lower our selling prices resulting in lower gross margins 
if the telecommunications market  and in particular the market for broadband access equipment  does not improve and grow  our business will be substantially harmed 
if our inventories exceed anticipated sales or selling prices  we may be required to write down our inventory  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we are required to order or build inventory well in advance of the time of our anticipated sales 
in this regard  our inventory increased substantially in the fourth quarter of because sales were substantially less than our anticipated demand 
in the event that our sales do not increase  the sales price of our products decreases or we are otherwise unable to control inventory levels consistent with actual demand  we may be required to write down a substantial portion of our inventory  as we did in such a write down would adversely affect both our balance sheet and operating results in future periods 
if the communications  internet and cable television industries do not grow and evolve in a manner favorable to our business strategy or us  our business may be seriously harmed 
our future success is dependent upon the growth of the communications industry  the cable television industry and  in particular  the internet 
these markets continue to evolve rapidly because of advances in technology and changes in customer demand 
we cannot predict growth rates or future trends in technology development 
it is possible that cable television operators  telecommunications companies or other suppliers of broadband services will decide to adopt alternative architectures or technologies that are incompatible with our current or future products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture and sell products that incorporate or are compatible with these new architectures or technologies  our business will suffer 
also  decisions by customers to adopt new technologies or products are often delayed by extensive evaluation and qualifications processes and can result in delays of current products 
in addition  the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide communications market  which resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services  may not continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies 
in addition  the growth in demand for internet services and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced communications products may not continue at its current rate or at all 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we may not be able to successfully operate xtend or integrate xtend or other businesses that we may choose to acquire  in a cost effective and non disruptive manner and realize anticipated benefits 
we recently acquired xtend  a provider of infrastructure solutions that expand the bandwidth of cable television lines 
we also continue to explore investments in or acquisitions of other companies  products or technologies  including companies or technologies that are not complementary or related to our current wireless broadband access business 
we may be unsuccessful in operating xtend as a profitable business as we were unable to operate shira as a profitable business 
in addition  we may have difficulty integrating xtend s or other companies personnel  operations  products and technologies into our current business 
it also may be difficult to manage xtend since most of its management is currently in israel and in atlanta  georgia 
these difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business  divert the time and attention of our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of xtend or any other acquisition may not be realized 
future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and the incurrence of large and immediate write offs  any of which could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we expect that we will expend significant resources in searching for and investigating new business opportunities  and may be unsuccessful in acquiring new businesses 
if xtend fails to achieve significant market penetration and customer acceptance of its products  its prospects would be substantially harmed 
the market for broadband products in the cable television industry is extremely competitive  subject to drastic technological changes and highly fragmented 
xtend has not generated any revenue 
its products are new and relatively unknown 
to date  xtend has only begun to install its product with customers in field trials 
there can be no assurance that xtend s initial installations will be successful 
as an early stage operation  xtend may face challenges such as market resistance to a new product  perceptions regarding customer support and quality control 
xtend will generate significant sales only if it is able to penetrate this market and create market share in this industry 
if xtend is unable to do so  its business would be harmed and its prospects significantly diminished 
xtend will need to develop distribution channels and management resources to market and sell its products 
xtend is at a very early stage in the commercialization of its products 
xtend currently has strictly limited relationships with potential customers and distributors as well as limited professional sales staff 
xtend will be successful only if it is able to develop distribution channels to market and sell its products 
in order to develop such channels and market and sell its products  xtend will need to build a well connected team of executives and marketing professionals 
many of these executive and professionals will likely need to be based in the united states 
it may be difficult for xtend to hire and retain qualified personnel 
integrating new personnel  particularly us based personnel  into xtend may be challenging from a culture and logistics perspective because most of xtend s employees are currently based in israel 
meanwhile  the management of vyyo inc has very limited experience in the cable industry 
xtend currently has limited exposure to global business opportunities 
it will not be able to take advantage of any meaningful potential global demand for its products unless and until it is able to develop global distribution channels and strategies 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we will depend on cable and telecommunications industry capital spending for much of our revenue and any decrease or delay in such spending would adversely affect our prospects 
demand for our products and those of xtend will depend on the size and timing of capital expenditures by telecommunications service providers and msos 
these capital spending patterns are dependent upon factors including the availability of cash or financing  budgetary issues  regulation and or deregulation of the telecommunications industry  competitive pressures  alternative technologies  overall demand for broadband services  particularly relatively new services such as voice over internet protocol  industry standards  the pattern of increasing consolidation in the industry  and general consumer spending and overall economic conditions 
if msos and telecommunications service providers do not make significant capital expenditures  our prospects could be adversely affected 
xtend will depend on future demand for additional bandwidth by the cable industry and its end customers 
because xtend s products expand available bandwidth over existing infrastructure  demand for our products depends on demand for additional bandwidth by the cable industry and its end customers 
the scope and timing of end user demand for such additional bandwidth is uncertain and hard to predict 
the factors influencing this demand include competitive offerings  applications availability  pricing models  costs  regulatory requirements and the success of initial roll outs 
if the future demand for bandwidth is insubstantial  is addressed by alternative technologies or does not develop in the near future  xtend s prospects will be adversely affected 
our participation or lack of participation in industry standards groups  such as the wimax forum  may adversely affect our business 
we are members of the wimax forum  an industry standards organization promoting deployment of broadband wireless access networks using the ieee standard 
however  neither vyyo inc nor xtend is currently active in the standards process of the cable television laboratories  inc  a cable industry consortium that establishes cable technology standards and administers compliance testing 
in the future  we may determine to join or not join other standards or similar organizations 
our membership in these organizations could dilute our proprietary intellectual property rights in our products while our failure to participate in others could jeopardize acceptance of any of our products that do not meet industry standards 
we have not yet developed a wimax compatible platform and some of our competitors are likely further along in their planning with respect to wimax 
product standardization  as may result from the wimax initiative or from initiatives of the major cable operators  may adversely affect our prospects and those of xtend 
product standardization initiatives encouraged by telecommunications companies and cable operators may adversely affect revenues  gross margins and profits 
in the past  standardization efforts by major cable operators 
table of contents 
index to financial statements have negatively impacted equipment vendors by leading to equipment obsolescence  commoditization and reduced margins 
if our products are not compliant with future standards  our prospects could be adversely affected 
because we operate in international markets  and particularly in china  we are exposed to additional risks which could cause our international sales to decline and our foreign operations to suffer 
sales outside of north america accounted for approximately of our revenues in in addition  we maintain research and development facilities in israel 
our reliance on international sales  operations and suppliers exposes us to foreign political and economic risks  which may impair our ability to generate revenues 
these risks include economic and political instability  terrorist acts  international conflicts and acts of war  our international customers ability to obtain financing to fund their deployments  changes in regulatory requirements and licensing frequencies to service providers  import or export licensing requirements and tariffs  labor shortages or stoppages  trade restrictions and tax policies  and limited protection of intellectual property rights 
any of the foregoing difficulties of conducting business internationally could seriously harm our business 
competition may result in lower average selling prices  and we may be unable to reduce our costs at offsetting rates  which may impair our ability to achieve profitability 
there has been significant price erosion in the broadband equipment field 
we expect that continued price competition among broadband access equipment and systems suppliers will reduce our gross margins in the future  particularly in asia 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of broadband access systems will continue to decline as product technologies mature 
we may be unable to reduce our manufacturing costs in response to declining average per unit selling prices 
our competitors may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and may be less vulnerable to the effects of price competition than we are 
these declines in average selling prices will generally lead to declines in gross margins and total profitability for these systems 
if we are unable to reduce our costs to offset declines in average selling prices  we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
our future growth depends on market acceptance of several emerging broadband services  on the adoption of new broadband technologies and on several other broadband industry trends 
future demand for our and xtend s products will depend significantly on the growing market acceptance of several emerging broadband services  including digital video  video on demand vod  high definition hd television  very high speed data services and voice over ip voip telephony 
the effective delivery of these services will depend in part on a variety of new network architectures  such as fiber to the premises fttp networks  new video compression standards such as mpeg and microsoft s windows media  the greater use of protocols such as ip  and the introduction of new consumer devices  such as advanced set top boxes and digital video recorders dvrs 
if adoption of these emerging services and or technologies is not as widespread or as rapid as we expect  our net sales growth will be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents 
index to financial statements furthermore  other technological  industry and regulatory trends will affect the growth of our business 
these trends include the following convergence  or the desire of certain operators to provide a combination of video  voice and data services to consumers  also known as the triple play  the use of digital video by businesses and governments  the privatization of state owned telecommunication companies in other countries  efforts by regulators and governments in the united states and abroad to encourage the adoption of broadband and digital technologies  and the extent and nature of regulatory attitudes towards such issues as competition between operators  access by third parties to networks of other operators  and new services such as voip 
if  for instance  operators do not pursue the triple play as aggressively as we expect  our net sales growth would be materially and adversely affected 
similarly  if our expectations regarding these and other trends are not met  our net sales may be materially and adversely affected 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to execute our business plan 
we expect that the net proceeds from our initial public offering completed in may  and our secondary public offering completed in september  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds for a number of uses  including research and development  hiring additional qualified personnel  and implementing further marketing and sales activities 
we may have to raise funds even sooner in order to fund more rapid expansion  to develop the business of our subsidiary xtend  to respond to competitive pressures or to otherwise respond to unanticipated requirements 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to increase our ongoing operations if necessary  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance systems or respond to competitive pressures 
this potential inability to raise funds on acceptable terms could seriously harm our business 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate  which may cause our share price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
these variations result from a number of factors  including the uncertain timing and level of market acceptance for our systems and the uncertain timing and extent of rollouts of broadband access equipment and systems by the major service providers  the fact that we often recognize a substantial proportion of our revenues in the last few weeks of each quarter  the ability of our existing and potential direct customers to obtain financing for the deployment of broadband access equipment and systems  the mix of products sold by us and the mix of sales channels through which they are sold  reductions in pricing by us or our competitors  
table of contents 
index to financial statements global economic conditions  the effectiveness of our system integrator customers in marketing and selling their network systems equipment  changes in the prices or delays in deliveries of the components we purchase or license  and any acquisitions or dispositions we may effect 
a delay in the recognition of revenue  even from one customer  may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period 
also  because only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues  if revenue levels for a quarter fall below our expectations  we will not be able to timely adjust expenses accordingly  which would harm our operating results in that period 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of investors in future periods  our share price will likely decline 
our sales and operations in asia  and china in particular  could be disrupted if contagious diseases spread 
the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and avian influenza bird flu in asia  and china in particular  has disrupted commerce in the region 
if sars  bird flu or other contagious diseases spread in asia  and china in particular  the markets for our products there may be adversely affected 
in addition  we will likely restrict the travel of our sales and technical personnel to china if such diseases are not contained  which could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products in china and provide technical assistance to our customers in china 
in addition  a restriction of flights in china could disrupt shipments of our products into china and delay or curtail sales of our products 
if sars  bird flu or other contagious diseases spread beyond asia  other world markets for our products may also be adversely affected 
the loss of one or more of our key customers would result in a loss of a significant amount of our revenues and adversely affect our business 
a relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of our revenues 
we expect that we will continue to depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues in future periods 
the loss of a major customer could seriously harm our ability to sustain revenue levels  which would seriously harm our operating results 
in addition  many of our customers are dependent on obtaining funding for their deployments 
the continued inability of our customers to obtain such funding will adversely affect their deployments  which would adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to sell shira s remaining assets on acceptable terms  or at all 
in august  the board of directors determined to cease all of shira s business operations and terminate all of shira s employees 
vyyo made this decision due to the continuing decline in shira s sales  shira s recurring losses and its inability to penetrate the market 
in addition  vyyo is exploring the sale of shira s remaining assets 
vyyo would likely receive only minimal value  if any  in a sale of shira s assets 
conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to produce and sell our systems 
vyyo s research and development  final testing and assembly facilities  and some contract manufacturers are located in israel 
in addition  xtend s headquarters  its research and development  final testing and assembly facilities and most of its employees are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
hostilities within israel have dramatically escalated in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements recent years  which could disrupt our operations 
in addition  the recent wars in iraq and afghanistan and the current military and political presence of the united states or its allies in iraq and afghanistan could cause increasing instability in the middle east and further disrupt relations between israel and its arab neighbors 
we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  a significant increase in inflation  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
as a result of the hostilities and unrest presently occurring within israel and the middle east  the future of the peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors is uncertain 
moreover  several countries still restrict business with israel and with israeli companies 
we could be adversely affected by restrictive laws or policies directed towards israel or israeli businesses 
our chief financial officer  one of our directors and many vyyo and xtend employees are based in israel  and many of them are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
our business cannot assess the full impact of these requirements on our workforce or business if conditions should change  and we cannot predict the effect on us of any expansion or reduction of these obligations 
because substantially all of our revenues are generated in us dollars while a portion of our expenses are incurred in new israeli shekels  our results of operations may be seriously harmed if the rate of inflation in israel exceeds the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel against the us dollar 
the functional currency for vyyo and its subsidiaries is the us dollar 
we generate substantially all of our revenues in us dollars  but we incur a substantial portion of our expenses  principally salaries and related personnel expenses related to research and development  in new israeli shekels  or nis 
as a result  we are exposed to the risk that the rate of inflation in israel will exceed the rate of devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar or that the timing of this devaluation lags behind inflation in israel 
because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  our customers can discontinue purchases of our systems at any time  which could adversely affect future revenues and operating results 
we sell our broadband access equipment and systems based on individual purchase orders 
our customers are generally not obligated by long term agreements to purchase our systems  and the agreements we have entered into do not obligate our customers to purchase a minimum number of systems 
our customers can generally cancel or reschedule orders on short notice and discontinue using our systems at any time 
further  having a successful field system trial does not necessarily mean that the customer will order large volumes of our systems 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our customers could seriously harm our operating results 
the potential effects of regulatory actions could impact spectrum allocation and frequencies worldwide and cause delays or otherwise negatively impact the growth and development of the broadband market  which would adversely affect our business 
countries worldwide are considering or are in the process of allocating frequencies for wireless applications  but not all markets have done so 
if the united states and or other countries do not provide sufficient spectrum for wireless applications or reallocate spectrum in the wireless frequency bands for other purposes  our customers may delay or cancel deployments in broadband wireless  which could seriously harm our business 
for example  there has been delay in the allocation of ghz licenses and our business is highly dependent upon new license grants in china and the manner in which those grants are distributed 
any further delays will adversely affect our customers deployments and could significantly harm our business 
the cable industry is also heavily regulated and changes in the regulatory landscape may adversely affect xtend s business 
for example  cable operators are currently required to carry a significant number of analog channels 
a reduction or elimination of this requirement may free bandwidth for these operators and reduce the potential market for xtend s products 

table of contents 
index to financial statements competition may decrease our market share  net revenues and gross margins  which may cause our stock price to decline 
the market for broadband access equipment and systems is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the main competitive factors in our and xtend s markets include product performance  features and reliability  price  stability  scope of product line  sales and distribution capabilities  technical service and support  relationships  particularly those with system integrators and operators  and industry standards 
certain of our and xtend s competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution  marketing and other resources than we have and  therefore  may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and other developments 
in addition  many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  broader product lines and established relationships with system integrators and service providers 
our primary competitors are alvarion inc  aperto networks  inc  nextnet wireless  inc  ip wireless  inc  navini networks  inc  wi lan inc  sr telecom  harris corporation  cambridge wireless limited  flarion  vcom  airspan and zte corporation 
xtend s primary competitors include scientific atlanta  motorola  c core and narad networks 
most of these competitors have existing relationships with one or more of our prospective customers  and many of these companies are operating and increasing their presence in the china market  on which we believe a substantial portion our business will depend 
for our broadband wireless offerings  we face competition from technologies such as digital subscriber line  fiber and cable 
in the cable industry  xtend s cable offerings face competition from technologies such as digital set top boxes  high end compression technologies and dvrs 
furthermore  the move towards open standards may increase the number of operators who will offer new services  which in turn may increase the number of competitors and drive down the capital expenditures per subscriber deployed 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  and competitive pressures may seriously harm our business 
hardware defects or software errors may increase our costs and impair the market acceptance of our systems  which would adversely affect our future operating results 
our systems will occasionally contain certain defects or errors 
this may result either from defects in components supplied by third parties or from errors or defects in our software or hardware that we have failed to detect 
we have in the past experienced  and may experience from time to time in the future  defects in new or enhanced products and systems after commencement of commercial shipments  or defects in deployed systems 
this may be observed in connection with stability or other performance problems 
our customers integrate our systems into their networks with components from other vendors 
accordingly  when problems occur in a network system  it may be difficult to identify the component that caused the problem 
regardless of the source of these defects or errors  we will need to divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to address the defect or error 
we have incurred in the past and may again incur significant warranty and repair costs related to defects or errors  and we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to these defects or errors 
the occurrence of defects or errors  whether caused by our systems or the components of another vendor  may result in significant customer relationship problems and injury to our reputation and may impair the market acceptance of our systems 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we depend on contract manufacturers and third party equipment and technology suppliers  and these manufacturers and suppliers may be unable to fill our orders or develop compatible  required technology on a timely basis  which would result in delays that could seriously harm our results of operations 
we currently have relationships with a limited number of contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of our broadband wireless systems  which contractors are located in israel  taiwan and china 
xtend s products are manufactured in israel by contract manufacturers 
these relationships may be terminated by either party with little or no notice 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our systems in required volumes  we would have to identify qualified alternative manufacturers  which would result in delays that could cause our results of operations to suffer 
our limited experience with these manufacturers does not provide us with a reliable basis on which to project their ability to meet delivery schedules  yield targets or costs 
if we are required to find alternative manufacturing sources  we may not be able to satisfy our production requirements at acceptable prices and on a timely basis  if at all 
any significant interruption in supply would affect the allocation of systems to customers  which in turn could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we currently have no formal written agreement with a manufacturer for our modem products 
our current inventory of modems will likely be insufficient to fulfill anticipated demand  and we will therefore be required to find a manufacturer in the near future 
our inability to enter into a written agreement with a manufacturer for our modems would harm our business 
in addition to sales to system integrators  we also sell in some instances directly to service providers 
such direct sales require us to resell to service providers equipment manufactured by third party suppliers and to integrate this equipment with the equipment we manufacture 
we are particularly dependent on third party radio suppliers in selling our ghz and other products 
we currently have no formal relationship with any third party supplier 
if we are unable to establish relationships with suppliers  or if these suppliers are unable to provide equipment that meets the specifications of our customers on the delivery schedules required by our customers  and at acceptable prices  our business would be substantially harmed 
xtend s products are implemented over the hybrid fiber coaxial plant and  as such  they interface and integrate with existing products from multiple other vendors 
future offerings by these vendors may not be sufficiently compatible with xtend s products 
in addition  xtend depends on the continuous delivery of components by various manufacturers of electronic connectors  filters  boards and transistors 
xtend has not yet manufactured or deployed its products in high volumes 
xtend products have not yet been produced in high volumes and there may be challenges and unexpected delays  such as quality control issues  in its attempts to increase volume and lower production costs 
our long term success depends on our ability to produce high quality products at a low cost and  in particular  to reduce the production cost of xtend equipment designed for residential use 
because xtend s products have not yet been deployed in high volume  there is significant technology risk associated with any such future deployment 
there can be no assurances that any such high volume deployment would be successful 
we obtain some of the components included in our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the loss of any of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenue 
we currently obtain key components from a limited number of suppliers 
some of these components  such as semiconductor components for our wireless hubs  are obtained from a single source supplier 
we generally do not have long term supply contracts with our suppliers 
these factors present us with the following risks delays in delivery or shortages in components could interrupt and delay manufacturing and result in cancellation of orders for our systems  suppliers could increase component prices significantly and with immediate effect  
table of contents 
index to financial statements we may not be able to develop alternative sources for system components  if or as required in the future  suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of components used in our systems 
in such event  we might need to modify our systems  which may cause delays in shipments  increased manufacturing costs and increased systems prices  and we may hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential component shortages or discontinuation 
the occurrence of any of these or similar events would harm our business 
if we do not effectively manage our costs  our business could be substantially harmed 
although we reduced the costs of our fixed broadband wireless operations in response to the decline in the telecommunications industry that began around  we have recently increased certain expenses to address new business opportunities and we will need to continue to monitor closely our costs and expenses 
if the market and our business do not expand  we may need to reduce further our operations 
the acquisition of xtend will cause our costs to increase as we seek to develop its business 
in addition  the acquisition agreement itself calls for payment to certain shareholders of xtend as part of the purchase price  subject to various performance criteria 
we depend on our key personnel  in particular davidi gilo  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and michael corwin  our president and chief operating officer  the loss of either of whom could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and key personnel 
in particular  we are highly dependent on the services of davidi gilo  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and michael corwin  our president and chief operating officer 
we do not carry key person life insurance on our senior management or key personnel 
any loss of the services of davidi gilo or michael corwin  other members of senior management or other key personnel could seriously harm our business 
delays and shortages in the supply of components from our suppliers and third party vendors could reduce our revenues or increase our cost of revenue 
delays and shortages in the supply of components are typical in our industry 
we have experienced minor delays and shortages on more than one occasion in the past 
in addition  any failure of necessary worldwide manufacturing capacity to rise along with a rise in demand could result in our subcontract manufacturers allocating available capacity to larger customers or to customers that have long term supply contracts in place 
our inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity at acceptable prices  or any delay or interruption in supply  could reduce our revenues or increase our cost of revenue and could seriously harm our business 
third parties may bring infringement claims against us that could harm our ability to sell our products and result in substantial liabilities 
third parties could assert  and it could be found  that our technologies infringe their proprietary rights 
we could incur substantial costs to defend any litigation  and intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following obtain licenses to the infringing technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  or expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we also may experience infringement claims based on shira s technology and products 
accordingly  any infringement claim or litigation against us could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  we may not be able to compete and our ability to provide unique products may be compromised 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
our pending or future patent applications may not be approved and the claims covered by such applications may be reduced 
if allowed  our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength  and others may independently develop similar technologies or products 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
any such litigation  regardless of the outcome  could be expensive and time consuming  and adverse determinations in any such litigation could seriously harm our business 
similarly  our pending or future trademark applications may not be approved and may not be sufficient to protect our trademarks in the markets where we either do business or hope to conduct business 
the inability to secure any necessary trademark rights could be costly and could seriously harm our business 
we regularly evaluate and seek to explore and develop derivative products relating to our broadband access equipment and systems 
we may not be able to secure all desired intellectual property protection relating to such derivative products 
furthermore  because of the rapid pace of change in the broadband industry  much of our business and many of our products rely on technologies that evolve constantly and this continuing uncertainty make it difficult to forecast future demand for our products 
because of our long product development process and sales cycle  we may incur substantial expenses without anticipated revenues that could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
a customer s decision to purchase our broadband access equipment and systems  as well as xtend s line of products  typically involves a significant technical evaluation  formal internal procedures associated with capital expenditure approvals and testing and acceptance of new systems that affect key operations 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with our systems can be lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks  over which we have little or no control 
because of the growing sales cycle and the likelihood that we may rely on a small number of customers for our revenues  our operating results could be seriously harmed if such revenues do not materialize when anticipated  or at all 
government regulation and industry standards may increase our costs of doing business  limit our potential markets or require changes to our business model and adversely affect our business 
the emergence or evolution of regulations and industry standards for broadband products  through official standards committees or widespread use by operators  could require us to modify our systems  which may be expensive and time consuming  and to incur substantial compliance costs 
radio frequencies are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states  foreign laws and international treaties 
each country has different regulations and regulatory processes for wireless communications equipment and uses of radio frequencies 
failure by the regulatory authorities to allocate suitable  sufficient radio frequencies to potential customers in a timely manner could result in the delay or loss of potential orders for our systems and seriously harm our business 
we are subject to export control laws and regulations with respect to certain of our products and technology 
we are subject to the risk that more stringent export control requirements could be imposed in the future on product classes that include products exported by us  which would result in additional compliance burdens and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements could impair the enforceability of our contract rights 
we may not be able to renew our export licenses as necessary from time to time 
in addition  we may be required to apply for additional licenses to cover modifications and enhancements to our products 
any revocation or expiration of any requisite license  the failure to obtain a license for product modifications and enhancements  or more stringent export control requirements could seriously harm our business 
we are incurring additional costs and devoting more management resources to comply with increasing regulation of corporate governance and disclosure 
we are spending an increased amount of management time and external resources to understand and comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and rules of the nasdaq national market  the market on which our shares are listed 
allocating the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards has increased general and administrative expenses and caused a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities 
recent regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect earnings  affect our ability to raise capital and affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
since our inception  we have used stock options as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that our stock option plans are an important tool to link the long term interests of stockholders and employees  especially executive management  and serve to motivate management to make decisions that will  in the long run  give the best returns to stockholders 
the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes to the united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap  that require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants  as well as other equity based awards 
the ultimate outcome of this requirement will most likely negatively impact our earnings and could affect our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms 
in addition  new regulations implemented by the nasdaq national market requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
the government programs and benefits we receive require us to satisfy prescribed conditions 
these programs and benefits may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs and taxes and could seriously harm our business 
certain of our capital investments have been granted approved enterprise status under israeli law providing us with certain israeli tax benefits 
the benefits available to an approved enterprise are conditioned upon the fulfillment of conditions stipulated in applicable law and in the specific certificate of approval 
if we fail to comply with these conditions  in whole or in part  we may be required to pay additional taxes for the period in which we enjoyed the tax benefits and would likely be denied these benefits in the future 
from time to time  the government of israel has considered reducing or eliminating the benefits available under the approved enterprise program 
these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
the termination or reduction of these benefits would increase our taxes and could seriously harm our business 
as of the date hereof  our israeli subsidiaries  vyyo ltd 
and xtend  have accumulated loss carry forwards for israeli tax purposes and therefore has not enjoyed any tax benefits under current approved enterprise programs 
in the past  vyyo and xtend have received grants from the government of israel for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures for previous products in israel 
the regulations under which we received these grants restrict our ability to manufacture products or transfer technology outside of israel for products developed with this technology 
furthermore  these grants may not be available to us in the future

index to financial statements the government of israel has decided to cancel  as of june   the ability of companies to submit new applications for approved enterprise status 
this change in the government policy may hinder us in the future with respect to any benefits we may have received for new undertakings which would have been entitled to approved enterprise status 
several of our directors and officers have relationships with davidi gilo and his affiliated companies that could be deemed to limit their independence 
several members of our board of directors  lewis broad  neill brownstein  avraham fischer  samuel kaplan and alan zimmerman  and our president and chief operating officer  michael corwin  have had professional relationships with our chairman of the board  davidi gilo  and his affiliated companies for several years 
these members of our board of directors previously served on the boards of directors of dsp communications  inc and or dsp group  inc  of which mr 
gilo was formerly the controlling stockholder and the chairman of the board  and mr 
corwin previously served as an officer of dsp group 
in addition  avraham fischer is a senior partner of the law firm of fischer  behar  chen co  which represents us on matters relating to israeli law  and is an investor and co chief executive officer of an israeli investor group in which mr 
gilo is also an investor 
there are no family relationships between these directors and officers  and no member of our compensation committee serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or compensation committee 
however  the long term relationships between these directors and officers and mr 
gilo and his affiliated companies could be deemed to limit their independence 
the extensive business activities of our board members could cause new facts to develop that could also be deemed to limit their independence 
because our management has the ability to control stockholder votes  the premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced and any merger or takeover may be delayed 
our management collectively own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  will be able to control the outcome of all matters submitted for stockholder action  including electing members to our board of directors  approving significant change in control transactions  determining the amount and timing of dividends paid to themselves and to our public stockholders  and controlling our management and operations 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business consolidation involving us  or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares 
this concentration of ownership could also negatively affect our stock s market price or decrease any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and any electrical or natural resource crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
we rely on a continuous power supply for manufacturing and to conduct our business operations 
interruptions in electrical power supplies occur around the world from time to time 
meanwhile  prices of the resources  such as electrical power and crude oil  upon which we ultimately rely  directly or indirectly  in running our business have been volatile 
power shortages  as have occurred in california and china  could disrupt our manufacturing and business operations and those of many of our suppliers  and could cause us to fail to meet production schedules and commitments to customers and other third parties 
any disruption to our operations or those of our suppliers could result in damage to our current and prospective business relationships and could result in lost revenue and additional expenses  thereby harming our business and operating results

index to financial statements because the nasdaq national market is likely to continue to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations  the price of our stock may decline 
the market price of our shares has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or those of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or technological innovations  introduction and adoption of new industry standards  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  changes in the market valuations of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or partnerships  and sales of our common stock 
many of these factors are beyond our control and may negatively impact the market price of our common stock  regardless of our performance 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology and telecommunications related companies in particular  have been highly volatile 
our common stock may not trade at the same levels of shares as that of other technology companies and shares of technology companies  in general  may not sustain their current market prices 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may be the target of similar litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business and operating results 
provisions of our governing documents and delaware law could discourage acquisition proposals or delay a change in control 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if that change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 
specifically our board of directors has the authority to issue common stock and preferred stock and to determine the price  rights and preferences of any new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval  our board of directors is divided into three classes  each serving three year terms  super majority voting is required to amend key provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  there are limitations on who can call special meetings of stockholders  stockholders are not able to take action by written consent  and advance notice is required for nominations of directors and for stockholder proposals 
in addition  provisions of delaware law and our stock option plans may also discourage  delay or prevent a change of control or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
it may be difficult to enforce a us judgment against us and our nonresident chief financial officer  directors and experts 
our chief financial officer  two of our directors  and some of the experts named in this report are nonresidents of the united states  and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the united states 
therefore  it may be difficult to enforce a judgment obtained in the united states based upon the civil or criminal liabilities provisions of the united states federal securities laws against us or any of those persons or to effect service of process upon these persons in the united states

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
substantially all of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars  although a substantial portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels  or nis 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations that may arise from changes in foreign exchange rates 
in the event of an increase in inflation rates in israel  or if appreciation of the nis occurs without a corresponding adjustment in our dollar denominated revenues  our results of operation and business could be materially harmed 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
substantially all of these amounts consisted of corporate and government fixed income securities and money market funds that invest in corporate and government fixed income securities that are subject to interest rate risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  all investments with maturities of three months or greater are classified as available for sale and considered to be short term investments 
while most of our short term investments are classified as available for sale  we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
we may not be able to obtain similar rates after maturity as a result of fluctuating interest rates 
we do not hedge any interest rate exposures 
quantitative interest rate disclosure as of december  if market interest rates were to increase on december  immediately and uniformly by  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately  or approximately of the total portfolio approximately of total assets 
assuming that the average yield to maturity on our portfolio at december  remains constant throughout and assuming that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances at december  remain constant for the duration of  interest income for would be approximately million 
assuming a decline of in the market interest rates at december   interest income for would be approximately million in  which represents a decrease in interest income of approximately  the decrease in interest income will result in a decrease of the same amount to net income and cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s cash equivalents and available for sale securities at december   over the remaining contractual lives
