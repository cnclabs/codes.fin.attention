item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents other department of defense contracts during  hnfs managed two behavioral health services subcontracts which support prime contracts issued by the department of defense s quality of life office 
under these subcontracts  hnfs and mhn have teamed together to provide family counseling and domestic abuse victim advocacy to members of the us military and their families at certain department of defense locations in the united states  germany and italy 
the services provided under these subcontracts are not tricare benefits and are provided independently from the services provided under our tricare contract for the north region 
total revenue for these subcontracts as of december  was  veterans affairs during  hnfs administered contracts with the us department of veterans affairs to manage community based outpatient clinics in states 
hnfs also managed other contracts with the us department of veterans affairs in locations and one contract with the us marshals service for claims re pricing services 
total revenues for our veterans affairs business were approximately million as of december   representing a increase over these revenues are derived from service fees received and have no insurance risk associated with them 
provider relationships and responsibilities we maintain a network of qualified physicians  hospitals and other health care providers in each of the states we offer managed care products and services 
physician relationships the following table sets forth the number of primary care and specialist physicians contracted either directly with our hmos or through our contracted participating physician groups ppgs as of december  primary care physicians includes both hmo and ppo physicians specialist physicians includes both hmo and ppo physicians total under many of our hmo plans and pos plans  and primarily in california  members are required to select a ppg and a primary care physician from within that group 
in our other plans  including most of our plans outside of california  members may be required to select a primary care physician from the broader hmo network panel of primary care physicians 
some hmo open access plans and ppo plans do not require the member to select a primary care physician 
the primary care physicians and ppgs assume overall responsibility for the care of members 
medical care provided directly by such physicians includes the treatment of illnesses not requiring referral  and may include physical examinations  routine immunizations  maternity and child care  and other preventive health services 
the primary care physicians and ppgs are responsible for making referrals approved by the hmo s or ppg s medical director as required under the terms of our various plans to specialists and hospitals 
certain of our hmos offer enrollees open panels under which members may access any physician in the network  or network physicians in certain specialties  without first consulting their primary care physician 
ppg and physician contracts are generally for a period of at least one year and are automatically renewable unless terminated  with certain requirements for maintenance of good professional standing and compliance with our quality  utilization and administrative procedures 
in california and connecticut  ppgs generally receive a monthly capitation fee for every member assigned to it 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
the capitation fee represents payment in full for all medical and ancillary services specified in the provider agreements 
in these capitation fee arrangements  in cases where the capitated ppg cannot provide the health care services needed  such ppgs generally contract with specialists and other ancillary service providers to furnish the requisite services under capitation agreements or negotiated 
table of contents fee schedules with specialists 
outside of california and connecticut  most of our hmos reimburse physicians according to a discounted fee for service schedule  although several have capitation arrangements with certain providers and provider groups in their market areas 
our connecticut hmo has a capitation contract with the connecticut state medical society ipa csms 
however  all administration  referral authorization and claims administration is performed by our connecticut health plan 
physicians are paid on a fee for service basis and reinsurance is provided by health net services bermuda  ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  to the ipa if claims exceed a specified aggregate limit  which means we effectively assume all risk for costs exceeding the capitation payment 
we are in the process of renegotiating our contract with csms to eliminate the capitation arrangement and  as such  the need for reinsurance 
we currently expect to finalize the new contract with csms on or prior to the end of the first quarter of the inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
for services provided under our ppo and pos products  we ordinarily reimburse physicians pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements 
hospital relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for hospital care primarily through contracts with selected hospitals in their service areas 
these hospital contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
covered inpatient hospital care for our hmo members is comprehensive 
it includes the services of hospital based physicians  nurses and other hospital personnel  room and board  intensive care  laboratory and x ray services  diagnostic imaging and generally all other services normally provided by acute care hospitals 
hmo or ppg nurses and medical directors are actively involved in discharge planning and case management  which often involves the coordination of community support services  including visiting nurses  physical therapy  durable medical equipment and home intravenous therapy 
in late  we began to see a pronounced increase in the number of high dollar  stop loss inpatient claims we were receiving from hospitals 
this increase was caused by some hospitals  primarily in california  aggressively raising chargemasters and billing for items separately when we believed they should have been included in the base charge 
we responded to this trend by instituting a number of practices designed to reduce the cost of these claims  including  but not limited to  line item review of itemized billing statements and review of  and adjustment to  the level of prices charged on stop loss claims 
by early we began to see evidence that our claims review practices were causing significant friction with hospitals 
in the fourth quarter of  management decided to enter into negotiations to settle a large number of provider disputes in our california and northeast health plans  a majority of which related to alleged underpayment of stop loss claims 
as a result of management s decision to settle these provider disputes  we recorded a million pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of for expenses associated with provider settlements that have been  or are currently in the process of being  resolved 
we are now in the process of renegotiating our contracts with our california hospitals to provide for  among other things  a fixed reimbursement structure for reimbursement of inpatient costs  including methodologies such as diagnostic related groupings  higher stop loss thresholds and not to exceed provisions 
for additional information regarding provider disputes and the fourth quarter earnings charge  see item legal proceedings provider disputes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents ancillary and other provider relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for ancillary and other provider services  such as ambulance  laboratory  radiology and home health primarily through contracts with selected providers in their service areas 
these contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
in certain cases  these provider services are included in contracts our health plan subsidiaries have with ppgs and hospitals 
additional information concerning our business competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  legislative reform and market pressures brought about by a better informed and better organized customer base 
our hmos face substantial competition from for profit and nonprofit hmos  ppos  self funded plans including self insured employers and union trust funds  blue cross blue shield plans  and traditional indemnity insurance carriers  some of which have substantially larger enrollments and greater financial resources than we do 
the development and growth of companies offering internet based connections between health care professionals  employers and members  along with a variety of services  could also create additional competitors 
we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered  size and quality of provider network  quality of service  responsiveness to user demands  financial stability  comprehensiveness of coverage  diversity of product offerings  and market presence and reputation 
the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market 
over the past several years  a health plan s ability to interact with employers  members and other third parties including health care professionals via the internet has become a more important competitive factor 
to that end  we have made technology investments to enhance our electronic interactions with third parties 
we believe that we compete effectively against other health care industry participants 
our key competitors in california are kaiser permanente  blue cross of california  pacificare of california and blue shield of california 
kaiser is the largest hmo in california based on number of enrollees and blue cross of california is the largest ppo provider in california based on number of enrollees 
all together  these four plans and health net account for a majority of the insured market in california 
there are also a number of small  regional based health plans that compete with health net primarily in the small business group market segment 
the combined commercial hmo membership for aetna  inc  cigna corp 
and the regional plans constitutes approximately of the insured market in the state 
our largest competitor in arizona is blue cross blue shield 
our arizona hmo also competes with unitedhealth group inc  cigna  pacificare health systems  inc  aetna and humana inc 
our oregon health plan competes primarily against kaiser  pacificare of oregon  providence  regence blue cross blue shield and lifewise 
our connecticut health plan competes for business with wellpoint  inc  connecticare  inc and cigna 
our main competitors in new york are unitedhealthcare oxford health plans  wellchoice  inc and aetna 
our main competitors in new jersey are unitedhealthcare oxford health plans  horizon blue cross and health insurance plan of new york 
marketing and sales we market our products and services to individual members through independent brokers  agents and consultants and through the internet 
we market our products and services for our group health business utilizing a three step process 
we first market to potential employer groups and group insurance brokers and consultants 

table of contents we then provide information directly to employees once the employer has selected our health coverage 
finally  we engage members and employers in marketing for member and group retention 
although we market our products and services primarily through independent brokers  agents and consultants  we use our limited internal sales staff to serve certain large employer groups 
once selected by a large employer group  we solicit enrollees from the employee base directly 
during open enrollment periods when employees are permitted to change health care programs  we use a variety of techniques to attract new enrollees  including  without limitation  direct mail  work day and health fair presentations and telemarketing 
our sales efforts are supported by our marketing division  which engages in product research and development  multicultural marketing  advertising and communications  and member education and retention programs 
premiums for each employer group are generally contracted on a yearly basis and are payable monthly 
we consider numerous factors in setting our monthly premiums  including employer group needs and anticipated health care utilization rates as forecasted by us based on the demographic composition of  and our prior experience in  our service areas 
premiums are also affected by applicable regulations that prohibit experience rating of group accounts ie  setting the premium for the group based on its past use of health care services and by state regulations governing the manner in which premiums are structured 
we believe that the importance of the ultimate health care consumer or member in the health care product purchasing process is likely to increase in the future  particularly in light of advances in technology and online resources 
accordingly  we intend to focus our marketing strategies on the development of distinct brand identities and innovative product service offerings that will appeal to potential health plan members 
for example  in  we introduced decision power sm  which is a series of programs designed to more directly involve patients in their health care decisions 
these programs allow our members to access information and consult with health coaches as they are making decisions regarding health care issues 
we first introduced decision power sm to a select group of health plan participants in january and  in  are expanding access to decision power sm to a broader range of our health plan members 
based on feedback received from health plan members who have participated in the decision power sm programs  we believe decision power sm is being met favorably throughout our service areas 
we believe that decision power sm could be a meaningful competitive differentiator for our health plans in the future 
health net one systems consolidation project we are in the process of converting a number of information systems in our health plan business to a single system environment 
at the completion of the project  we will consolidate various systems into one general ledger system  one core claims system  one data warehouse system and one core web system 
in addition  we will reduce our number of surround information systems to and consolidate our data centers to a single site with a tested backup facility 
key actions completed on the health net one systems consolidation project to date include consolidation to a single general ledger  consolidation of health plan portals  consolidation of data centers to a single site with backup facilities  consolidation of surround information systems and conversion of arizona s core claims system 
in late  we converted to a common eligibility database and in we converted to a common provider database 
in order to increase our focus on market demands  revenue generation and cost containment initiatives and to ensure the continued stabilization of claim payment patterns  we have decided to change the sequence of the health net one initiatives  placing the medical management initiatives and developing market capabilities ahead of the claim components of health net one 
as a result  the conversion of the california and oregon claims systems have been rescheduled for we believe that completion of the health net one systems consolidation project will improve customer client service and communication  national product capabilities realize operational and cost efficiencies and improve our decision making capability 
in addition  we believe that completion of the project will enable us to improve our claims turnaround time  auto adjudication rates  electronic data interchange and internet capabilities 
however  there are risks associated with the health net one systems consolidation project 
see risk factors the failure to effectively maintain our management information systems could adversely affect our business 

table of contents medical management we believe that managing health care costs is an essential function for a managed care company 
among the medical management techniques we utilize to contain the growth of health care costs are pre authorization or certification for outpatient and inpatient hospitalizations and a concurrent review of active inpatient hospital stays and discharge planning 
we also contract with third parties to manage certain conditions such as neonatal intensive care unit admissions and stays  as well as chronic conditions such as asthma  diabetes and congestive heart failure 
these techniques are widely used in the managed care industry and are accepted practice in the medical profession 
in  we adopted several new initiatives  primarily in the northeast  intended to strengthen medical management practices and to help lower commercial health care cost trends 
we recontracted for radiology services  engaged a new out of network contractor and implemented more stringent inpatient concurrent review 
we began to see some positive results from these initiatives throughout for example  our more focused inpatient review processes caused commercial hospital days per thousand commercial enrollees in new jersey to drop from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of we expect to continue to see positive results  including lower commercial health care cost trends throughout we are also engaged in similar efforts in california  where the focus has been management of inpatient hospital stays and recontracting with hospitals to reduce our exposure to charge based reimbursement 
accreditation we pursue accreditation for certain of our health plans from the national committee for quality assurance ncqa  the joint committee on accreditation of healthcare organizations jcaho and the utilization review accreditation commission urac 
ncqa  jcaho and urac are independent  non profit organizations that review and accredit hmos 
hmos that comply with review requirements and quality standards receive accreditation 
our california hmo subsidiary has received ncqa accreditation  our connecticut  new jersey and new york subsidiaries have received jcaho accreditation and mhn and our arizona subsidiary have each received urac accreditation 
certain of our health plan subsidiaries are in the process of applying for ncqa or jcaho accreditation 
cost containment in most hmo plan designs  either the primary care physician or the treating specialist is responsible for obtaining authorization from either the health plan or the ppg for most medical services except for emergency services 
we believe that this authorization process reduces inappropriate use of medical resources and achieves efficiencies in cases where reimbursement is based on risk sharing arrangements 
to limit possible abuse in utilization of hospital services in non emergency situations  all of our health plans require that a member obtain certification for specified medical conditions prior to admission as an inpatient  and the inpatient admission is then subject to continuing review during the member s hospital stay 
in addition to reviewing the appropriateness of hospital admissions and continued hospital stays  we play an active role in evaluating alternative means of providing care to members  such as outpatient services and home based care 
quality assessment quality assessment is a continuing priority for us 
all of our health plans have a quality assessment plan administered by a committee composed of medical directors and primary care and specialist physicians 
the committees responsibilities include periodic review of medical records  development and implementation of standards of care based on current medical literature and community standards  and the collection of data relating to results of treatment 
all of our health plans also have a subscriber grievance procedure and or a member satisfaction program designed to respond promptly to member grievances 
elements of these subscriber grievance procedures and member satisfaction programs are incorporated both within the ppgs and within our health plans 

table of contents government regulation our business is subject to comprehensive federal regulation and state regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
these laws and regulations govern how we conduct our businesses and result in additional requirements  restrictions and costs to us 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all current state and federal laws and regulations applicable to our business 
certain of these laws and regulations are discussed below 
federal legislation and regulation medicare legislation 
on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the mma was signed into law 
this complex legislation made many significant structural changes to the federal medicare program 
of special interest to us and other companies with medicare contracts is that funding has been increased to the medicare advantage program in and in addition  health savings accounts were allowed as part of the mma for non medicare eligible individuals and groups 
the mma also added a voluntary prescription drug benefit  called a part d benefit  that will be available to medicare beneficiaries starting january  medicare advantage plans will be required to offer the voluntary prescription drug benefit in at least one of their product options 
the mma also authorized a medicare endorsed prescription drug card program that is offered on a voluntary basis and provides medicare beneficiaries access to prescription drug discounts 
we participate in the prescription drug discount card program and began offering the card to our members in june these drug cards will cease being available when the voluntary prescription drug benefit program is implemented in january the mma changes the methodology for payment to private plans beginning in  when a form of competitive bidding begins 
the first bids are due in june for the medicare advantage plans  the bidding process compares each plan s bid  which is based on historical health care costs  to a benchmark cost figure developed by cms 
the projected savings from the benchmark rate will be used to fund additional benefits 
the remaining will be retained by cms 
the mma also authorized regional ppos to serve regions  and other features with the intent to provide a private market option on a broader scale across the united states 
many significant parts of the mma were addressed through the regulatory process 
the cms issued final regulations to implement the mma in january we are engaged in intensive evaluation of this legislation and the related regulations and intend to pursue opportunities either enhanced or created by the law 
we have also restructured our medicare program management team in an effort to build infrastructure to capitalize on opportunities presented by the mma 
the restructured medicare program management team has been designed to increase our capability for effective execution on growth and cost management initiatives in response to opportunities presented by the mma and the medicare program generally 
privacy regulations 
the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the federal  state and local level 
these laws and regulations are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the gramm leach bliley act 
hipaa and the implementing regulations that have been adopted in connection therewith impose obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors relating to the privacy and security of electronically transmitted protected health information phi 
the regulations  consisting of privacy regulations  transactions and codeset requirements and security regulations require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  adopt rigorous internal procedures to protect phi  
table of contents create policies related to the privacy of phi and enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
we are in compliance with the hipaa privacy regulations and the requirements relating to transactions and codesets 
the security regulations have a compliance date of april and we have implemented many of the security regulations well in advance of the compliance date 
in addition  we have created a security plan to ensure appropriate compliance prior to the effective date for the remaining security regulations 
the gramm leach bliley act generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares non public personal information with a non affiliated third party 
like hipaa  this law sets a floor standard  allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 
federal hmo act 
under the federal health maintenance organization act of the hmo act  services to members must be provided substantially on a fixed  prepaid basis without regard to the actual degree of utilization of services 
premiums established by an hmo may vary from account to account through composite rate factors and special treatment of certain broad classes of members  and through prospective but not retrospective rating adjustments 
several of our hmos are federally qualified in certain parts of their respective service areas under the hmo act and are therefore subject to the requirements of such act to the extent federally qualified products are offered and sold 
erisa 
most employee benefit plans are regulated by the federal government under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
employment based health coverage is such an employee benefit plan 
erisa is administered  in large part  by the us department of labor dol 
erisa contains disclosure requirements for documents that define the benefits and coverage 
it also contains a provision that causes federal law to preempt state law in the regulation and governance of certain benefit plans and employer groups  including the availability of legal remedies under state law 
in  the dol adopted regulations under erisa which mandated certain claims and appeals processing requirements 
these regulations became fully effective on january  and  during  we made certain adjustments in our claims systems to comply with these regulations 
the cost of the adjustments was not material from a financial point of view 
miscellaneous 
our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms 
cms has the right to audit hmos and ppos operating under medicare contracts to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 
our medicaid business is also subject to regulation by cms  as well as state agencies  and is generally examined on a periodic basis by such state agencies 
california laws and regulations health insurance act of in october  the governor of california signed the health insurance act of the california health insurance act  commonly referred to as pay or play  which would have required all california employers employing more than employees to pay a fee or show proof of health insurance or other acceptable health coverage for both employees and their dependents beginning january  the california health insurance act was repealed by referendum in november the vote to repeal the act was close and supporters have threatened to circulate an initiative measure to reenact it 
no assurances can be given as to whether or not such a measure will be considered in or thereafter 
california hmo regulations 
california hmos  such as hn california and our behavioral health plan  mhn  are subject to california state regulation  principally by the department of managed health care dmhc under the knox keene act 
among the areas regulated by the knox keene act are adequacy of administrative operations  the scope of benefits required to be made available to members  
table of contents procedures for review of quality assurance  enrollment requirements  composition of policy making bodies to assure that plan members have access to representation  procedures for resolving grievances  the interrelationship between hmos and their health care providers  adequacy and accessibility of the network of health care providers  timely and accurate payment of provider claims  provision of services that are culturally and linguistically accessible  and initial and continuing financial viability of the hmo and its risk bearing providers 
on september   assembly bill ab was signed into law 
ab amended and added several sections to the knox keene act 
for example  ab increased the interest rate that health care service plans must pay on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period and granted the dmhc additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices as defined in ab 
as required by ab  the dmhc adopted final regulations addressing both claims reimbursement and provider dispute resolution procedures 
the dmhc advised health care service plans to implement them for all services provided on and after january  any material modifications to the organization or operations of hn california and mhn are subject to prior review and approval by the dmhc 
this approval process can be lengthy and there is no certainty of approval 
other significant changes require filing with the dmhc  which may then comment and require changes 
in addition  under the knox keene act  hn california and mhn must file periodic reports with  and are subject to periodic review and investigation by  the dmhc 
non compliance with the knox keene act  including the provisions added and amended by ab  may result in an enforcement action  fines and penalties  and  in the most severe cases  limitations on or revocation of the knox keene license 
other laws and regulations in each state in which our hmo and insurance subsidiaries collectively  regulated subsidiaries do business  our regulated subsidiaries must meet numerous state licensing criteria and secure the approval of state licensing authorities before implementing certain operational changes  including the development of new product offerings and  in some states  the expansion of service areas 
state departments of insurance dois regulate our insurance business under various provisions of state insurance codes and regulations 
to remain licensed  each regulated subsidiary must continue to comply with state laws and regulations and may from time to time be required to change services  procedures or other aspects of its operations to comply with changes in applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  regulated subsidiaries must file periodic reports with  and their operations are subject to periodic examination by  state licensing authorities 
our regulated subsidiaries are required by state law to meet certain minimum capital and deposit and or reserve requirements in each state and may be restricted from paying dividends to their parent corporations under some circumstances 
for additional information regarding our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital requirements see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statutory capital requirements 
several states have increased minimum capital requirements  in response to proposals by the national association of insurance commissioners to institute risk based capital requirements 
regulations in these and other states may be changed in the future to further increase capital requirements 
such increases could require us to contribute additional capital to our regulated subsidiaries 
any adverse change in governmental regulation or in the regulatory climate in any state could materially impact the regulated subsidiaries operating in that state 
the hmo act and state laws place various restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to price their products freely 
we must comply with applicable provisions of state insurance and similar laws  including regulations governing our ability to seek ownership interests in new hmos  ppos and insurance companies  or otherwise expand our geographic markets or diversify our product lines 

table of contents pending federal and state legislation there are a number of other legislative initiatives and proposed regulations currently pending or previously proposed at the federal and state levels which could increase regulation of and costs incurred by the health care industry 
these measures and other initiatives  if enacted  could have significant adverse effects on our operations 
see risk factors proposed federal and state legislation affecting the managed health care industry could have an adverse effect on our operations below 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of the pending legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulation 
intellectual property we have filed for registration of and maintain several service marks  trademarks and tradenames that we use in our business  including marks and names incorporating the health net phrase 
we utilize these and other marks and names in connection with the marketing and identification of products and services 
we believe such marks and names are valuable and material to our marketing efforts 
employees as of december   health net and its subsidiaries employed  persons on a full time basis and persons on a part time or temporary basis 
these employees perform a variety of functions  including  among other things  provision of administrative services for employers  providers and members  negotiation of agreements with physician groups  hospitals  pharmacies and other health care providers  handling of claims for payment of hospital and other services  and provision of data processing services 
our employees are not unionized and we have not experienced any work stoppages since our inception 
we consider our relations with our employees to be very good

our profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict and control health care costs 
a substantial majority of the revenue we receive is used to pay the costs of health care services or supplies delivered to our members 
the total health care costs we incur are affected by the number and type of individual services provided and the cost of each service 
our future profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict health care costs and to control future health care costs through underwriting criteria  utilization management  product design and negotiation of favorable professional and hospital contracts 
changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost cases  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups and numerous other factors affecting health care costs may adversely affect our ability to predict and control health care costs as well as our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may result in increased health care costs or limit our ability to negotiate favorable rates 
one of the fastest increasing categories of our health care costs is the cost of hospital based products and services 
as such  in addition to the circumstances and factors that may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs  our hmos face an even higher risk with hospital expenses that could have a material adverse effect 
factors underlying the increase in hospital costs include  but are not limited to  the underfunding of public programs  such as medicaid and medicare  growing rates of uninsured individuals  new technology  state initiated mandates  alleged abuse of hospital chargemasters  an aging population and  under certain circumstances  relatively low levels of hospital competition 
in  several of our health plans experienced higher than expected claims costs  especially for inpatient and outpatient hospital claims 
these higher than expected costs caused our consolidated results of operations to fall short of expectations in as realized premium yields were lower than cost trends 
in an effort to account for these higher cost trends  we instituted higher premium pricing in our california and northeast health plans and increased reserves in the fourth quarter of another significant category of our health care costs are costs of pharmaceutical products and services 
although pharmaceutical costs have not been increasing at the level of hospital costs  evolving regulation may impact the ability of our hmos to continue to receive existing price discounts on pharmaceutical products for our members 
other factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of drugs  utilization of new and existing drugs and changes in discounts 
the inability to forecast and manage our health care costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
our premium revenue is set in advance of the actual delivery of services  and  in certain circumstances  before contracting with providers 
while we attempt to take into account our estimate of expected health care costs over the premium period in setting the premiums we charge  factors such as competition  regulations and other circumstances may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs 
in addition  many factors may  and often do  cause actual health care costs to exceed those costs estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased utilization of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  seasonality  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  and insured population characteristics 
our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by significant disparities between the premium increases of our health plans and those of our major competitors or by limitations on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels 
over the course of  we instituted premium increases at the high end of the range of premium increases instituted by our competitors 
we lost members as a result of these premium increases and could lose additional members in the future 
maintaining premiums at the high end of the market also increases the risk that our health plans are affected by adverse risk selection 
adverse risk selection occurs when members who utilize higher levels of health care services compared with the insured population as a whole choose to remain with our health plans at the higher premium rates rather than risk moving to another plan 
this could cause health care costs to be higher than anticipated and therefore cause our financial results to fall short of expectations 
our inability to estimate and maintain adequate reserves for claims may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our reserves for claims are estimates of future costs based on various assumptions 
the accuracy of these estimates may be affected by external forces such as changes in the rate of inflation  the regulatory environment  the judicious administration of claims  medical costs and other factors 
included in the reserves for claims are estimates for the costs of services which have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates are continually monitored and reviewed and  as settlements are made or estimates adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates  the actual liability could differ significantly from the amounts reserved 
for example  throughout  we had to continually increase reserves due to changes in claim payment patterns in our california health plan 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million pre tax earnings charge 
of the million recorded  million related to adverse reserve development million of which related to and prior 
the prior period adverse reserve development was due in part to the changes in payment practices in our california health plan and to inadequate reserves previously booked for claims costs during for additional information on the fourth quarter earnings charge  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements 
if the assumptions on which the estimates are based prove to be incorrect and reserves are inadequate to cover our actual claim costs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may experience losses as a result of the regional concentration of our business 
our business operations are concentrated in the northeast in the states of connecticut  new york and new jersey and in the states of california  arizona and oregon 
due to this concentration in a small number of states  we are exposed to a potential deterioration in our financial results resulting from the risk of a significant economic downturn in these states 
if economic conditions in these states significantly deteriorate  we may experience a reduction in existing and new business  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if any one of our health plans experiences significant 
table of contents losses  our consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
for example  in early  our new jersey health plan experienced hospital cost trends significantly higher than the trends we estimated when we established premiums and potentially higher than those of its competitors 
these higher hospital cost trends caused a deterioration in margins in early the deterioration in margins in new jersey had an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations in a similar deterioration in margins in any one of the other small number of states we operate in could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to offset the deterioration with adequate future premium increases 
our businesses are highly regulated 
our business is subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  financial requirements  licensing requirements  enrollment requirements and periodic examinations by governmental agencies 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders of managed health care companies such as health net 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and or enrollment growth  and or increase our health care and administrative costs  and or increase our exposure to liability with respect to members  providers or others 
in particular  our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations relating to cash reserves  minimum net worth  premium rates  and approval of policy language and benefits 
although these regulations have not significantly impeded the growth of our business to date  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals  or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities  could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 
in december  the department of health and human services promulgated regulations under hipaa related to the privacy and security of electronically transmitted phi 
the regulations require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to a comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  b adopt rigorous internal procedures to safeguard phi and c enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
in addition  the regulations could expose us to additional liability for  among other things  violations of the regulations by our business associates 
states may enact laws imposing privacy standards that differ from and or are more strict than those imposed under hipaa 
the states ability to promulgate stricter rules  and uncertainty regarding many aspects of the regulations  make compliance with the relatively new regulatory landscape difficult 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from medicare 
the medicare reform legislation enacted in  or the mma  is complex and wide ranging and changes to the current operation of our medicare services could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
it has recently been reported that the costs of the mma may substantially exceed original estimates 
if the mma is rescinded or amended  our ability to maintain our current level of revenue from our medicare business or to add additional medicare revenue could be materially and adversely affected 
final regulations implementing the mma were adopted in january these regulations address  among other things  the competitive bidding process to be implemented for medicare private market plans in and  and the characteristics of private market products under the mma 
if these regulations result in increased costs or complexities for the operation of our medicare program  then our current medicare program business could be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to realize any return on our investments made to capitalize on opportunities presented by the mma 
see government regulation federal legislation and regulation medicare legislation for additional information regarding the mma 

table of contents we are also subject to various federal and state governmental audits and investigations 
these audits and investigations could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in certain programs  or the imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 
there are frequently legislative proposals before the united states congress and state legislatures and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels which  if enacted  could materially affect the managed health care industry and the regulatory environment 
recent financial difficulties of certain health care service providers and plans and or continued publicity of the health care industry could alter or increase legislative consideration of these or additional proposals 
these proposals include initiatives which  if enacted  could have significant adverse effects on our operations  including subjecting us to additional litigation risk and regulatory compliance costs 
such measures propose  among other things  to expand health plan exposure to tort and other liability under federal and or state law  including for coverage determinations  provider malpractice and care decisions  restrict a health plan s ability to limit coverage to medically necessary care  require third party review of certain care decisions  increase minimum capital or risk based capital requirements  expedite or modify grievance and appeals procedures  hold health plans liable for medical malpractice  restrict the ability of health plans to share or shift the cost of health care services to providers or members  reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for services provided under government programs such as medicare or medicaid  enhance the providers rights of timely payment and access to appeal processes  segment existing markets to create an unsuitable regulatory environment  mandate certain benefits and services  including mental health parity  that could increase costs  add further restrictions and administrative and disclosure requirements related to compensatory arrangements pertaining to agents and brokers in connection with the sale of products  restrict a health plan s ability to select and or terminate providers  and regulate health care premiums 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulations 
legislation or regulation which causes us to change our current manner of operation or increases our exposure to liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to compete 
a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our revenues relate to federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  such as medicare  medicaid and tricare 
under government funded health programs  the 
table of contents government payor typically determines premium and reimbursement levels 
if the government payor reduces premium or reimbursement levels or increases them by less than our costs increase  and we are unable to make offsetting adjustments through supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans  we could be adversely affected 
contracts under these programs are generally subject to frequent change  including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the revenue received by us or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
changes of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business 
changes to government health care coverage programs in the future may also affect our willingness to participate in these programs 
states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid 
currently  many states are experiencing budget deficits  and some states  including california  have reduced or begun to reduce  or have proposed reductions in  payments to medicaid managed care providers 
any significant reduction in payments received in connection with medicaid could adversely affect our business 
the amount of government receivables set forth in our consolidated financial statements represents our best estimate of the government s liability under tricare and other federal government contracts 
in general  government receivables are estimates and subject to government audit and negotiation 
in addition  inherent in government contracts are an uncertainty of and vulnerability to government disagreements 
final amounts we actually receive under government contracts may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we recognize 
if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals and other providers that we contract with  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals and other providers as a means to assure access to health care services for our members  to manage health care costs and utilization and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or take other actions which could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers and members  disruption to provider access for current members or to support growth  or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations and multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or even monopolies 
many of these providers may compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market our products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
we contract with professional providers in california and connecticut primarily through capitation fee arrangements 
our connecticut hmo has a capitation contract with the connecticut state medical society ipa csms  however  all administration  referral authorization and claims administration is performed by our connecticut health plan 
we also use capitation fee arrangements in areas other than california and connecticut  but to a lesser extent 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
provider groups that enter into capitation fee arrangements generally contract with specialists and other secondary providers  and may contract with primary care physicians  to provide services 
the inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in connecticut  we currently provide reinsurance to csms  effectively assuming all risk for costs exceeding the capitation payment 
we are in the process of renegotiating our contract with csms to eliminate the capitation arrangement and  as such  the need for reinsurance 
we currently expect to finalize the new contract with csms on or prior to the end of the first quarter of in california  the liability 
table of contents of our hmo subsidiaries for unpaid provider claims has not been definitively settled 
there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will not be liable for unpaid provider claims 
there can also be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with secondary providers  the failure of any of which could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
some providers that render services to our members and insureds are not contracted with our plans and insurance companies 
in those cases  there is no pre established understanding between the provider and the plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider 
in some states and product lines  the amount of compensation is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translated into dollar terms 
in such instances providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the plan or balance bill our member 
we may then have an obligation to protect our members against financial harm  either by paying the provider the additional amount demanded or by reimbursing the member for his her out of pocket payment 
the uncertainty of the amount to pay and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of the payment could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
provider groups and hospitals have in certain situations commenced litigation and or arbitration proceedings against us to recover amounts they allege to be underpayments due to them under their contracts with us 
we believe that provider groups and hospitals have become increasingly sophisticated in their review of claim payments and contractual terms in an effort to maximize their payments from us and have increased their use of outside professionals  including accounting firms and attorneys  in these efforts 
these efforts and the litigation and arbitration that results from them could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million pre tax charge 
of that amount  million related to expenses associated with settlements involving provider disputes that have been  or are currently in the process of being  resolved 
for additional information regarding provider disputes see item legal proceedings provider disputes 
our forecasts and other forward looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties 
our performance may not be consistent with these forecasts and forward looking statements 
from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  net earnings and other operating and financial metrics 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and  as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
for example  during  we experienced higher than expected commercial health care costs and lower than expected enrollment in our health plans which had a negative impact on our results of operations 
the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors  including those described in this annual report on form k  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire publicly available mix of historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us and our services  when evaluating our prospective results of operations 
the markets in which we do business are highly competitive and our inability to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
we compete with a number of other entities in the geographic and product markets in which we operate  some of which other entities may have certain characteristics  capabilities or resources that give them an advantage in competing with us 
these competitors include hmos  ppos  self funded employers  insurance companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers 
in addition  financial services or other 
table of contents technology based companies could enter the market and compete with us on the basis of their streamlined administrative functions 
customers of ours may decide to perform for themselves functions or services currently provided by us  which could result in a decrease in our revenues 
our providers and suppliers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred both in our industry and in industries which act as our suppliers  such as the hospital  physician  pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
this activity may create stronger competitors and or result in higher health care costs 
in addition  our contracts with government agencies are frequently up for re bid and the loss of any one of our significant government contracts to a competitor could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  approximately of our consolidated medicaid revenues for the year ended december  were derived from california and of our medi cal revenues for the year ended december  were derived from los angeles county  california 
our contract with the california department of health services for los angeles county is scheduled to expire on march  if the los angeles county medi cal contract is awarded to one of our competitors and not to us  it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated medicaid business 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  our ability to retain or increase customers  our revenue growth  our pricing flexibility  our control over medical cost trends and our marketing expenses may all be adversely affected 
we face risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial monetary damages 
we are subject to a variety of legal actions to which any corporation may be subject  including employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  shareholder suits  including for securities fraud  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  we incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims particularly related to our business  such as failure to pay for or provide health care  poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged  provider disputes  including disputes over withheld compensation  and claims related to self funded business 
also  there are currently  and may be in the future  attempts to bring class action lawsuits against various managed care organizations  including us 
in some of the cases pending against us  substantial non economic or punitive damages are being sought 
see item legal proceedings and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our legal proceedings 
while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities  others such as punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance  the insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level which would result in us effectively self insuring cases against us 
the deductible on our errors and omissions e o insurance has reached such a level 
given the amount of the deductible  the only cases which would be covered by our e o insurance are those involving catastrophic claims 
we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters 
in addition  recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
although we have established reserves for litigation costs  we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves are adequate to cover such costs 
therefore  these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and could prompt us to change our operating procedures 
we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness  or need to refinance existing indebtedness  in the future  which may adversely affect our operations 
our indebtedness includes million in unsecured senior notes 
in addition  to provide liquidity  we have a million five year revolving senior credit facility that expires in june as of december   no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
if we were to 
table of contents draw down on our senior credit facility thereby decreasing our borrowing capacity  or incur additional debt in the future  it could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general operating requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
in an effort to lower our interest expense  we are currently considering our financing alternatives  including refinancing or repurchasing our senior notes and pursuing a public debt offering and other financing alternatives 
our ability to obtain any financing  whether through issuing public debt or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our senior notes  initiate and complete a public debt offering or otherwise obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
we are a holding company and a substantial amount of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
consequently  our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt depends  in part  on the amount of cash that we receive from our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries ability to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings  business and tax considerations  legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to hmo and insurance regulations that require them to meet or exceed various capital standards and restrict their ability to pay dividends or make cash transfers to us 
if our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying us dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to us  it could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and health net  inc s cash flow 
for additional information regarding our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital requirements  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statutory capital requirements 
our senior credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our senior credit facility requires us to comply with certain covenants that impose restrictions on our operations  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in other activities 
in addition  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth requirement 
on march   we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility 
the amendment  among other things  amends the definition of consolidated ebitda to exclude from the calculation of consolidated ebitda during the five fiscal quarter periods commencing with the fiscal quarter ended december  and ending with the fiscal quarter ended december   up to million relating to cash and non cash  non recurring charges in connection with litigation and provider settlement payments  any increase in medical claims reserves and any premiums relating to the repayment or refinancing of our senior notes to the extent such charges cause a corresponding reduction in consolidated net worth as defined in the senior credit facility 
on september   moody s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from baa to ba and on november   s p downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from bbb to bb 
because the moody s 
table of contents rating on our senior unsecured debt is below baa and the s p rating is below bbb  we are currently prohibited under the terms of our senior credit facility from making dividends  distributions or redemptions in respect of our capital stock in excess of million in any consecutive four quarter period  are subject to a minimum borrower cash flow fixed charge coverage ratio rather than the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  are subject to additional reporting requirements to the lenders  and are subject to increased interest and fees applicable to any outstanding borrowings and any letters of credit secured under the credit facility 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our senior credit facility 
if we do not comply with the restrictive covenants under our senior credit facility  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
changes in the value of our investment assets could have a negative effect on our results of operations and stockholders equity 
substantially all of our investment assets are in interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities or equity securities 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase and increasing as such rates decrease 
in addition  our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to state laws and regulations that govern the types of investments that are allowable and admissible in those subsidiaries portfolios 
there can be no assurance that our investment assets will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations or otherwise  could have a negative affect our results of operations and stockholders equity 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and services 
managed health care companies have received and continue to receive negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry 
the managed health care industry has also recently experienced significant merger and acquisition activity  giving rise to speculation and uncertainty regarding the status of companies in our industry 
our marketing efforts may be affected by the amount of negative publicity to which the managed health care industry has been subject  as well as by speculation and uncertainty relating to merger and acquisition activity among companies in our industry 
speculation  uncertainty or negative publicity about us  our industry or our lines of business could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products or services  require changes to our products or services  or stimulate additional legislation  regulation  review of industry practices or private litigation that could adversely affect us 
the failure to effectively maintain our management information systems could adversely affect our business 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our management information systems assists us in  among other things  pricing our services  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  billing our customers on a timely basis and identifying accounts for collection 
our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification  claims status and other information 
we have many different information systems for our various businesses and these systems require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our merger  acquisition and divestiture activity requires frequent transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information management systems 
we are in the process of consolidating a significant number of our core and surround systems as part of our health net one systems consolidation project 
see additional information concerning our business health net one systems consolidation project for information regarding this consolidation project 
we believe that by consolidating our systems into one common nationwide set  we will gain operational and cost efficiencies 
any difficulty or delay associated with 
table of contents the transition to or from information systems  any inability or failure to properly maintain management information systems  or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs  could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  significant increases in administrative expenses and or other adverse consequences 
in addition  we may  from time to time  obtain significant portions of our systems related or other services or facilities from independent third parties which may make our operations vulnerable to adverse effects if such third parties fail to perform adequately 
if we are unable to manage our general and administrative expenses  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
the level of our administrative expenses can affect our profitability  and administrative expense increases are difficult to predict 
while we attempt to effectively manage such expenses  including through the development of online functionalities and other projects designed to create administrative efficiencies such as the health net one systems consolidation project  increases in staff related and other administrative expenses may occur from time to time due to business or product start ups or expansions  growth  membership declines or changes in business  difficulties or delays in projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  acquisitions  reliance on outsourced services  regulatory requirements  including compliance with hipaa regulations  or other reasons 
in may  we commenced an involuntary workforce reduction of approximately positions in order to enhance efficiency and reduce administrative costs 
if we experience significant increases in our general and administrative expenses in the future we may be required to consider taking actions similar to those taken in may if we are unable to manage our general and administrative expenses  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we depend  in part  on independent brokers and sales agents to market our products and services  and recent regulatory investigations have focused on certain brokerage practices  including broker compensation arrangements and bid quoting practices 
we market our products and services both through sales people employed by us and through independent sales agents 
independent sales agents typically do not work with us on an exclusive basis and may market health care products and services of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent sales agents and we cannot assure you that these agents will continue to market our products at a reasonable cost 
although we have a number of sales employees and agents  if key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals were to leave us  our ability to retain existing customers and members could be impaired 
there have been a number of recent investigations and enforcement actions against insurance brokers and insurers regarding inappropriate or undisclosed payments made by insurers to brokers for the placement of insurance business 
while we are not aware of any unlawful practices by any of our agents or brokers in connection with the marketing and sales of our products and services  current investigations by the new york attorney general and other regulators could result in changes in industry practices that could have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price of our common stock is subject to volatility 
in  the hmo index  an index comprised of managed care organizations  recorded a rise in its value  while the value of health net s stock decreased by approximately 
there can be no assurance that our common stock will trade at a pace equivalent to this index or to the standard poors mid cap index of which health net common stock is also a component 
the market prices of our common stock and the securities of certain other publicly traded companies in our industry have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors  including public communications regarding managed care  legislative or regulatory actions  litigation or threatened litigation  
table of contents health care cost trends  pricing trends  competition  earning or membership reports of particular industry participants  and acquisition activity 
there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time or the impact of these or any other factors on our stock price 
natural disasters  including earthquakes  fires and floods  could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations and result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
natural disasters such as fire  flood  earthquake  tornado  power loss  virus  telecommunications failure  break in or similar event could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations  result in loss of data  and or delay or impair our ability to service our members and providers 
we have in place a disaster recovery plan which is intended to provide us with the ability to maintain fully redundant systems for our operations in the event of a natural disaster utilizing various alternate sites provided by a national disaster recovery vendor 
however  there can be no assurance that such adverse effects will not occur in the event of a disaster 
we have encountered certain operational issues in connection with the implementation of our disaster recovery plan 
we are in the process of addressing those issues  however  there can be no assurance that our disaster recovery plan will prevent damage or interruption of our systems and operations if a natural disaster were to occur either before or after those issues are resolved 
any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

provider disputes in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are party to arbitrations and litigation involving providers 
a number of these arbitrations and litigation relate to alleged stop loss claim underpayments  where we paid a portion of the provider s billings and denied certain charges based on a line by line review of the itemized billing statement to identify terms and services that should have been included within specific charges and not billed separately 
a smaller number of these arbitrations and litigation relates to alleged stop loss claim underpayments where we paid a portion of the provider s billings and denied the balance based on the level of prices charged by the provider 
in late  we began to see a pronounced increase in the number of high dollar  stop loss inpatient claims we were receiving from providers 
as stop loss claims rose  the percentage of payments made to hospitals for stop loss claims grew as well  in some cases in excess of 
the increase was caused by some hospitals aggressively raising chargemasters and billing for items separately when we believed they should have been included in a base charge 
management at our california health plan at that time decided to respond to this trend by instituting a number of practices designed to reduce the cost of these claims 
these practices included line item review of itemized billing statements and review of  and adjustment to  the level of prices charged on stop loss claims 
by early  we began to see evidence that our claims review practices were causing significant friction with hospitals although  at that time  there was a relatively limited number of outstanding arbitration and litigation proceedings 
we responded by attempting to negotiate changes to the terms of our hospital contracts  in many cases to incorporate fixed reimbursement payment methodologies intended to reduce our exposure to the stop loss claims 
as we reached the third quarter of  an increase in arbitration requests and other litigation prompted us to review our approach to our claims review process for stop loss claims and our strategy relating to 
table of contents provider disputes 
given that our provider network is a key strategic asset  management decided in the fourth quarter of to enter into negotiations in an attempt to settle a large number of provider disputes in our california and northeast health plans 
the majority of these disputes related to alleged underpayment of stop loss claims 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million pre tax charge for expenses associated with settlements with providers that had been  or are currently in the process of being resolved  principally involving these alleged stop loss claims underpayments 
the earnings charge was recorded following a thorough review of all outstanding claims and management s decision in the fourth quarter of to enter into negotiations in an attempt to settle a large number of these claims in our california and northeast health plans 
we have currently settled approximately of the california provider disputes upon which the earnings charge was based representing approximately of the amounts reserved for in these disputes  including tenet healthcare  as described below  and are in settlement discussions with a substantial number of the remaining providers 
in connection with these settlements  we have entered into new contracts with a large portion of our provider network 
tenet healthcare in july  hospitals owned or operated by tenet healthcare corporation tenet filed an arbitration demand against us alleging a total of approximately million in claim underpayments by our california health plan subsidiary 
the arbitration demand was amended in october to increase the demand of alleged claim underpayments to approximately million plus interest  attorneys fees and punitive damages  and also asserted various other claims 
we filed counterclaims against tenet on various theories of recovery  including tenet s pricing strategy 
in late  tenet advised us that its demand relating to the alleged claim underpayments had increased to approximately million  not including interest  attorneys fees and punitive damages 
on february   we entered into a settlement agreement with tenet to resolve all outstanding claims and counter claims in the arbitration 
as part of the settlement agreement  we agreed to pay tenet million and release our counter claims in exchange for tenet s release of all of its claims in the arbitration 
the settlement agreement also establishes a procedure for adjudication and resolution of other claims for hospital services through november   the date we entered into a new provider service agreement with the tenet hospitals that incorporates a fixed reimbursement structure that is structured to avoid similar disputes 
the settlement amount paid to tenet was included as part of the fourth quarter earnings charge described above

litigation 
as part of the settlement agreement  we agreed to pay the sntl litigation trust million and receive a release of all of the sntl litigation trust s claims against us 
we have accounted for the settlement with sntl litigation trust as discontinued operations on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents however  following the announcement of the settlement  we learned that  on or about october   capital z financial services fund ii  lp and certain related parties referred to collectively as cap z had filed suit against us in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york  asserting claims arising out of the same big transaction that is the subject of the settlement agreement with the sntl litigation trust 
cap z previously had participated as a creditor in the superior bankruptcy and is a beneficiary of the sntl litigation trust 
the cap z complaint alleges at least million in damages and seeks unspecified punitive damages and the costs of the action  including attorneys fees 
following the commencement of the cap z proceeding  we and the sntl litigation trust entered into a revised settlement agreement to  among other things  require the trust to obtain bankruptcy court approval of the revised settlement agreement and reduce the amount payable to the sntl litigation trust to million 
we paid the million in the fourth quarter of as more fully described below  there are various procedural motions pending in the cap z matter 
we will reassess our position after rulings on these motions 
the bankruptcy court approved the revised settlement agreement on december  following that approval  district court action brought by superior was dismissed with prejudice on december  cap z appealed the district court s order approving the settlement 
on march   pursuant to the stipulation of cap z and the sntl trust  the district court dismissed with prejudice cap z s appeal from the bankruptcy court order approving the revised settlement 
accordingly  the bankruptcy court s approval of the settlement is final 
cap z s complaint alleges that we made certain misrepresentations and or omissions  relating to the sufficiency of big s reserves  the nature of its internal financial condition including its accounts receivable and the status of certain of its captive insurance programs 
cap z claims that in reliance thereon it voted its shares in favor of the big acquisition and provided financing to superior for that transaction 
cap z alleges at least million in damages and seeks unspecified punitive damages and the costs of the action  including attorneys fees 
we removed the action from new york state court to the district court for the southern district of new york 
presently before that court is cap z s motion to remand the action to state court and our motion to dismiss the action 
no hearing date for those motions has been scheduled 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against cap z s claims 
this case is subject to many uncertainties  and  given its complexity and scope  its final outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of the cap z matter depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
however  at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of the cap z matter should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
miscellaneous proceedings in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are also party to various other legal proceedings  including  without limitation  litigation arising out of our general business activities  such as contract disputes and employment litigation  and claims brought by members seeking coverage or additional reimbursement for services allegedly rendered to our members  but which allegedly were either underpaid or not paid 
we are also subject to claims relating to the performance of contractual obligations to providers  members and others  including the alleged failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the manner in which we process claims 
these other legal proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of other legal proceedings  pending provider arbitrations and cases depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
however  at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of all pending legal proceedings  after consideration of applicable reserves  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity

this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in its entirety  since it contains detailed information that is important to understanding health net  inc and its subsidiaries results and financial condition 
overview in  our overall financial results did not meet our expectations 
earnings per share fell by to per basic and diluted share for  compared with per basic share and per diluted share in  primarily as a result of higher than anticipated commercial health care costs and lower enrollment 
in addition  as described below  we recorded a million pre tax earnings charge in the fourth quarter ended december   which had a significant impact on our overall financial results 

table of contents beginning in the latter part of the first quarter ended march   we began to implement a plan designed to improve financial performance the financial performance improvement plan 
as part of the financial performance improvement plan  we increased prices in our commercial health plans and commenced a series of initiatives designed to reduce the growth rate of our commercial health care costs 
following implementation of the financial performance improvement plan  the rate of increase in commercial per member per month pmpm premium yields climbed from a increase in the first quarter ended march  compared with the first quarter ended march   to a increase in the fourth quarter ended december  compared with the fourth quarter ended december  we expect that the rate of growth in pmpm premium yields will continue to increase in the first quarter of we believe that the implementation of higher premiums caused employer groups  many of which had high health care cost trends  to leave our health plans and obtain coverage elsewhere  which resulted in an overall decrease in commercial health plan enrollment from december  to december  the losses were greatest in our california and northeast health plans 
we expect these declines to extend into the first half of in the fourth quarter ended december   we recorded a million pre tax earnings charge which was comprised of the following million of expenses associated with provider settlements  including legal costs  relating to claims processing and payment issues that have been or are being resolved  million of expenses for adverse reserve developments  most of which relates to the second and third quarters of  and million in severance  asset impairment and restructuring charges and other expenses 
provider settlement expenses 
following a thorough review of outstanding provider disputes and management s decision in the fourth quarter ended december  to settle a large number of provider disputes  we recorded an amount for provider settlements that reflects what we believe is a reasonable estimate to bring all of these matters to closure 
these provider disputes were primarily in our california health plan and related to claims issues extending as far back as for additional information regarding our provider disputes  see item legal proceedings provider disputes and results of operations health plan services costs 
reserve developments 
the fourth quarter pre tax earnings charge also included amounts recorded for prior period adverse reserve developments  most of which related to revisions to reserve estimates for the second and third quarters of approximately million of the million recorded for prior period adverse reserve developments relate to for information regarding our reserve restatements for december  and prior  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the adverse reserve developments are directly related to management s decision in to accelerate claims payment practices and disengage from the claims review practices  both designed to improve relations with providers 
as a result of deliberate actions to accelerate claims payments  we experienced higher level of paid claims in the first quarter of compared with these higher levels of paid claims persisted through the balance of and contributed to the increase in commercial health care costs 
this had the impact of masking the increasing trend in health care costs until the fourth quarter of when higher levels of paid claims than were previously estimated emerged 
the reserves established at december  assume a permanent increase in claims costs because of these changes 
severance  asset impairment and restructuring charges and other miscellaneous expenses 
we recorded million of miscellaneous items as part of the fourth quarter pre tax earnings charge  including severance and related benefit costs  lease terminations  the write off of certain investments and it assets and other balance sheet items 
for information regarding these balance sheet items  see results of operations severance  asset impairments and restructuring costs 

table of contents our success in will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain prices of our health plan products at a rate equal to or greater than the rate of growth in health care costs  as well as our ability to contain growth in our health care costs  especially hospital costs  by employing a range of medical management  pharmaceutical management and provider contracting strategies 
we must also begin to reverse the decline in commercial membership in the second half of and prepare for the substantial changes that will occur in medicare beginning january as a result of the implementation of various features of the mma 
in addition  we must sustain our focus on containing general and administrative costs while proceeding with the implementation of our health net one systems consolidation project

pmpm is calculated based on total at risk member months and excludes aso member months 
enrollment information health plan membership compared to health plan membership total health plan membership decreased to approximately million members at december  from approximately million members at december  enrollment in our commercial health plans  including aso members  decreased at december  compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily attributable to the premium pricing increases implemented in early to address higher health care costs and network provider issues 
the enrollment decline was seen in the large and small group markets in all of our commercial health plans except our arizona and oregon plans 
overall  small group and individual enrollment declined from to and large group enrollment declined 
we expect enrollment declines to persist at least through the first half of as we continue to maintain higher premiums 
membership in our federal medicare risk program increased at december  compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of membership growth in our oregon health plan  partially offset by membership losses from our planned withdrawal in selected counties in california 
medicare enrollment in our oregon health plan increased from to  members during  primarily as a result of our oregon health plan s participation in a medicare ppo demonstration project 
we participate in state medicaid programs in california  connecticut and new jersey 
california membership  where the program is known as medi cal  comprised of our medicaid membership at december  overall medicaid membership decreased at december  compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of competition in new jersey  a change in law that eliminated certain members eligibility in connecticut and the state of california s efforts to tighten eligibility requirements for participation in the medi cal and healthy families program 
in the third quarter of  we added a new county in california  accounting for approximately  new members 
despite ongoing concerns about the states ability to adequately fund these medicaid programs  we believe that the significant savings generated by medicaid managed care will provide ongoing future growth opportunities  as states may move more medicaid enrollees into managed care plans

see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the moody s and s p downgrades 
senior notes our senior notes consist of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of april  the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if either moody s or s p downgrades the rating ascribed to the senior notes below investment grade as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes 
on september   moody s announced that it had downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from baa to ba  which triggered an adjustment to the interest rate payable by us on our senior notes 
as a result of the moody s downgrade  effective september   the interest rate on the senior notes increased from the original rate of per annum to an adjusted rate of per annum  resulting in an increase in our interest expense of million on an annual basis 
on november   s p announced that it had downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from bbb to bb 
the adjusted interest rate of per annum will remain in effect for so long as the moody s rating on our senior unsecured debt remains below baa or the equivalent or the s p rating on our senior unsecured debt remains below bbb or the equivalent 
during any period in which the moody s rating on our senior unsecured debt is baa or the equivalent or higher and the s p rating on our senior unsecured debt is bbb or the equivalent or higher  the interest rate payable on the senior notes will be equal to the original rate of per annum 
the senior notes are redeemable  at our option  at a price equal to the greater of of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed  and the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the senior notes to be redeemed consisting of principal and interest  exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption  at the rate in effect on the date of calculation of the redemption price  discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the applicable yield to maturity as specified in the indenture governing the senior notes plus basis points plus  in each case  accrued interest to the date of redemption 
on february   we entered into swap contracts to hedge against interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate senior notes 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding the swap contracts 
senior credit facility on june   we entered into a new five year revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  swing line lender and l c issuer  jp morgan chase bank  as syndication agent  and the other lenders party thereto 
the senior credit facility refinanced and replaced our previous million 
table of contents day credit facility which matured june  and million revolving five year credit facility which was scheduled to mature june  
borrowings under our senior credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  and to service our working capital needs 
we must repay all borrowings  if any  under our senior credit facility by june   unless the maturity date under the senior credit facility is extended 
interest on any amount outstanding under the senior credit facility is payable monthly at a rate per annum of a libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points or b the higher of the bank of america prime rate and the federal funds rate plus  plus a margin of up to basis points 
we have also incurred and will continue to incur customary fees in connection with the senior credit facility 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under our senior credit facility and the maximum commitment level under our senior credit facility was million 
we can obtain letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million under our senior credit facility 
we transferred all existing letters of credit under our previous five year credit facility to the new senior credit facility 
as of december   these letters of credit totaled million in the aggregate 
no amounts had been drawn on any of these letters of credit as of december  as a result of issuing these letters of credit  the maximum amount that can be drawn under our senior credit facility is million as of december  in january  we secured additional letters of credit under our senior credit facility of million to guarantee workers compensation claim payments to certain external third party insurance companies in the event that we do not pay our portion of the workers compensation claims 
due to the additional letters of credit secured  the maximum amount that can be drawn under our senior credit facility as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k was million 
our senior credit facility requires us to comply with certain covenants that impose restrictions on our operations  including the maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum net worth and a limitation on dividends and distributions 
on september   moody s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from baa to ba and on november   s p downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating from bbb to bb 
because the moody s rating on our senior unsecured debt is below baa and the s p rating is below bbb  we are currently prohibited under the terms of the senior credit facility from making dividends  distributions or redemptions in respect of our capital stock in excess of million in any consecutive four quarter period  are subject to a minimum borrower cash flow fixed charge coverage ratio rather than the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  are subject to additional reporting requirements to the lenders  and are subject to increased interest and fees applicable to any outstanding borrowings and any letters of credit secured under the senior credit facility 
the minimum borrower cash flow fixed charge coverage ratio calculates the fixed charge on a parent company only basis 
in the event either moody s or s p upgrades our senior unsecured debt rating to at least baa or bbb  respectively  our coverage ratio will revert back to the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
on march   we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility 
the amendment  among other things  amends the definition of consolidated ebitda to exclude from the calculation of consolidated ebitda during the five fiscal quarter periods commencing with the fiscal quarter ended december  and ending with the fiscal quarter ended december   up to million relating to cash and non cash  non recurring charges in connection with litigation and provider settlement payments  any increase in medical claims reserves and any premiums relating to the repayment or refinancing of our senior notes to the extent such charges cause a corresponding reduction in consolidated net worth as defined in the senior credit facility 

table of contents contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations as of december  and their impact on our cash flows and liquidity are summarized below for the years ending december total there after dollars in millions long term debt operating leases other purchase obligations deferred compensation estimated future payments for pension and other benefits a a represents estimated future payments from through operating leases we lease office space under various operating leases 
certain leases are cancelable with substantial penalties 
see item properties for additional information regarding our leases 
other purchase obligations other purchase obligations include payments due under agreements for goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have included in the table set forth under the heading contractual obligations above  obligations related to a three year pharmacy benefit services agreement  a five year agreement for a nurse advice line and other related services  and a five year agreement for a disease and condition management services 
we have excluded from such table amounts already recorded in our current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have also excluded from such table various contracts we have entered into with our health care providers  health care facilities  the federal government and other contracts that we have entered into for the purpose of providing health care services 
we have excluded those contracts that allow for cancellation without significant penalty  obligations that are contingent upon achieving certain goals and contracts for goods and services that are fulfilled by vendors within a short time horizon and within the normal course of business 
the future contractual obligations in the contractual obligations table are estimated based on information currently available 
the timing of and the actual payment amounts may differ based on actual events 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under regulation s k a 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
principal areas requiring the use of estimates include revenue 
table of contents recognition  health care costs  reserves for contingent liabilities  amounts receivable or payable under government contracts  goodwill and recoverability of long lived assets and investments 
accordingly  we consider accounting policies on these areas to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a significant change in any one of these amounts may have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that we use in preparing our financial statements is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
health plan services health plan services premiums include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage  for which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts to provide care to enrolled medicare recipients 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the related enrollees are entitled to health care services 
premiums collected in advance of the month in which enrollees are entitled to health care services are recorded as unearned premiums 
from time to time  we make adjustments to our revenues based on retroactivity 
these retroactivity adjustments reflect changes in the number of enrollees subsequent to when the revenue is billed 
we estimate the amount of future retroactivity each period and accordingly adjust the billed revenue 
the estimated adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of contract renewal activity during the period and other information 
we refine our estimates and methodologies as information on actual retroactivity becomes available 
on a monthly basis  we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables to reflect allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on the creditworthiness of our customers  our historical collection rates and the age of our unpaid balances 
during this process  we also assess the recoverability of the receivables  and an allowance is recorded based upon their net realizable value 
those receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible  such as receivables from bankrupt employer groups  are fully written off against their corresponding asset account  with a debit to the allowance to the extent such an allowance was previously recorded 
reserves for claims and other settlements and health care and other costs payable under government contracts include reserves for claims incurred but not reported claims ibnr and received but unprocessed claims  and other liabilities including capitation payable  shared risk settlements  provider disputes  provider incentives and other reserves for our two reporting segments  health plan services and government contracts 
as of december   health plan services reserves for claims comprised approximately of reserves for claims and other settlements  and government contracts reserves for claims comprised approximately of health care and other costs payable under government contracts 
see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of changes in the reserve for claims 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for claims primarily by using standard actuarial developmental methodologies 
this method is also known as the chain ladder or completion factor method 
the developmental method estimates reserves for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid while taking into consideration  among other things  expected medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
a key component of the developmental method is the completion factor which is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the claims for services rendered for a given period 
while the completion factors are reliable and robust for older service periods  they are more volatile and less reliable for more recent periods since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been rendered 
accordingly  for the most recent months  the incurred claims are estimated from a trend analysis 
table of contents based on per member per month claims trends developed from the experience in preceding months 
this method is applied consistently year over year while assumptions may be adjusted to reflect changes in medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
an extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the estimates are highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and payment patterns and medical cost trends 
as such  the completion factors and the claims per member per month trend factor are the most significant factors used in estimating our reserves for claims 
since a large portion of the reserves for claims is attributed in the most recent months  the estimated reserves for claims is highly sensitive to these factors 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by these factors completion factor a increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims government contracts increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million million million million million medical cost trend b increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims government contracts increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million million million million million a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to the estimate of total claims for a given period 
therefore  an increase in completion factor percent results in a decrease in the remaining estimated reserves for claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trend used to estimate the per member per month cost for the most recent three months 
other relevant factors include exceptional situations that might require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims  such as system conversions  processing interruptions or changes  environmental changes or other factors 
in california  there were significant improvements in the claims processing that had a material impact upon the reserve levels as of december  none of the other factors had a material impact on the development of our claims payable estimates during any of the periods presented in this annual report on form k 
all of these factors are used in estimating reserves for claims and are important to our reserve methodology in trending the claims per member per month for purposes of estimating the reserves for the most recent months 
in developing its best estimate of reserves for claims  we consistently apply the principles and methodology listed above from year to year  while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors 
because reserves for claims includes various actuarially developed estimates  our actual health care services expense may be more or less than our previously developed estimates 
claim processing expenses are also accrued based on an estimate of expenses necessary to process such claims 
such reserves are continually monitored and reviewed  with any adjustments reflected in current operations 
hn of california  our california hmo  generally contracts with various medical groups to provide professional care to certain of its members on a capitated  or fixed per member per month fee basis 
capitation contracts generally include a provision for stop loss and non capitated services for which we are liable 
professional capitated contracts also generally contain provisions for shared risk 
we have risk sharing arrangements with certain of our providers related to approximately  members  primarily in the california commercial market 
shared risk arrangements provide for us to share with our providers the variance 
table of contents between actual costs and predetermined goals 
our health plans in connecticut  new jersey and new york market to small employer groups through a marketing agreement with the guardian 
we have approximately  members under this agreement 
in general  we share equally with the guardian in the profits of the marketing agreement  subject to certain terms of the marketing agreement related to expenses 
our hmos in other states also contract with hospitals  physicians and other providers of health care  pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements  hospital per diems  and case rates under which providers bill the hmos for each individual service provided to enrollees 
additionally  we contract with certain hospitals to provide hospital care to enrolled members on a capitation basis 
we assess the profitability of contracts for providing health care services when operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses 
significant factors that can lead to a change in our profitability estimates include margin assumptions  risk share terms and non performance of a provider under a capitated agreement resulting in membership reverting to fee for service arrangements with other providers 
contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of determining premium rates 
losses are determined by comparing anticipated premiums to estimates for the total of health care related costs less reinsurance recoveries  if any  and the cost of maintaining the contracts 
losses  if any  are recognized in the period the losses are determined and are classified as health plan services 
we held a premium deficiency reserve of million as of december  government contracts the tricare north region contract is made up of two major revenue components  health care and administrative services 
health care services revenue includes health care costs  including paid claims and estimated ibnr expenses  for care provided for which we are at risk and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
administrative services revenue encompasses all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contracts with the government 
revenues associated with the transition to the new tricare contract for the north region are recognized over the entire term of the contract 
under our new tricare contract for the north region we recognize amounts receivable and payable under the government contracts related to estimated health care ibnr expenses which are reported separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  these amounts are the same since all of the estimated health care ibnr expenses incurred are offset by an equal amount of revenues earned 
health care costs and associated revenues are recognized as the costs are incurred and the associated revenue is earned 
revenue related to administrative services is recognized as the services are provided and earned 
other government contracts revenues are recognized in the month in which the eligible beneficiaries are entitled to health care services or in the month in which the administrative services are performed or the period that coverage for services is provided 
revenue under the expired former region  region and regions  and contracts is subject to price adjustments attributable to inflation and other factors 
the effects of these adjustments are recognized on a monthly basis  although the final determination of these amounts could extend significantly beyond the period during which the services were provided 
amounts receivable under government contracts are comprised primarily of price adjustments and change orders for services not originally specified in the contracts 
change orders arise because the government often directs us to implement changes to our contracts before the scope and or value is defined or negotiated 
we start to incur costs immediately  before we have proposed a price to the government 
in these situations  we make no attempt to estimate and record revenue 
our policy is to collect and defer the costs incurred 
once we have submitted a cost proposal to the government  we will record the costs and the appropriate value for revenue  using our best estimate of what will ultimately be negotiated 

table of contents reserves for contingent liabilities in the course of our operations  we are involved on a routine basis in various disputes with members  health care providers  and other entities  as well as audits by government agencies that relate to our services and or business practices 
we and several of our competitors were named as defendants in a number of significant class action lawsuits alleging violations of various federal statutes  including the employee retirement income security act of and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act 
see item legal proceedings for additional information regarding these class actions 
we recognize an estimated loss from such loss contingencies when we believe it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loss estimates are based in part on an analysis of potential results  the stage of the proceedings  our relevant insurance coverage  consultation with outside counsel and any other relevant information available 
while the final outcome of these proceedings cannot be determined at this time  based on information presently available we believe that the final outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  our belief regarding the likely outcome of such proceedings could change in the future and an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition  the ultimate outcome of these loss contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty and it is difficult to measure the actual loss  if any  that might be incurred 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually based on the estimated fair value of the reporting units which comprise our health plan services and government contracts reportable segments 
we test for impairment on a more frequent basis in cases where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of goodwill 
our measurement of fair value is based on utilization of both the income and market approaches to fair value determination 
as a part of assessing impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform fair value measurements and utilize an independent third party professional services firm to assist with this assessment 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based upon converting expected cash flows to present value 
annual cash flows are estimated for each year of a defined multi year period until the growth pattern becomes stable 
the expected interim cash flows expected after the growth pattern becomes stable are calculated using an appropriate capitalization technique and then discounted 
the market approach uses a market valuation methodology which includes the selection of companies engaged in a line or lines of business similar to ours to be valued and an analysis of our comparative operating results and future prospects in relation to those of the guideline companies selected 
the market price multiples are selected and applied to us based on our relative performance  future prospects and risk profiles in comparison to those of the guideline companies 
methodologies for selecting guideline companies include the exchange methodology and the acquisition methodology 
the exchange methodology is based upon transactions of minority interests in publicly traded companies engaged in a line or lines of business similar to ours 
the public companies selected are defined as guideline companies 
the acquisition methodology involved analyzing the transaction involving similar companies that have been bought and sold in the public marketplace 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of our reporting units  including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings based on current and future plans and initiatives 
if these planned initiatives do not accomplish their targeted objectives  the assumptions and estimates underlying the goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected and have a material effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents recoverability of long lived assets and investments we periodically assess the recoverability of our long lived assets including property and equipment and other long term assets and investments where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value as follows long lived assets held and used we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
if we identify an indicator of impairment  we assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets held for sale long lived assets are classified as held for sale when certain criteria are met  which include management commitment to a plan to sell the assets  the availability of the assets for immediate sale in their present condition  whether an active program to locate buyers and other actions to sell the assets have been initiated  whether the sale of the assets is probable and their transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year  whether the assets are being marketed at reasonable prices in relation to their fair value and how unlikely it is that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets 
we measure long lived assets to be disposed of by sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices or the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale we classify an asset or asset group that will be disposed of other than by sale as held and used until the disposal transaction occurs 
the asset or asset group continues to be depreciated based on revisions to its estimated useful life until the date of disposal or abandonment 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the remaining period of use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance and continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits from our deferred tax assets only when an analysis of both positive and negative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for the estimated amount of potential assessments by taxing authorities upon their examination 
the reserve is comprised of amounts for potential specific issues 
table of contents arising in periods subject to examination 
these amounts are released from the reserve upon closure of such examinations and new amounts are added for specific issues for new tax years 
statutory capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital and surplus requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
certain subsidiaries must maintain ratios of current assets to current liabilities pursuant to certain government contracts 
management believes that as of december   all of our health plans and insurance subsidiaries met their respective regulatory requirements 
by law  regulation and governmental policy  our health plan and insurance subsidiaries  which we refer to as our regulated subsidiaries  are required to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  or risk based capital rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
the rbc formula  which calculates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized control level acl  which represents the minimum amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain the greater of the company action level rbc  calculated as of the acl  or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
because our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight authority  some of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital and surplus in excess of the rbc requirement  even though rbc has been adopted in their states of domicile 
we generally manage our aggregate regulated subsidiary capital against of acl  although rbc standards are not yet applicable to all of our regulated subsidiaries 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash or other assets to the parent company 
the reported and required statutory net worth for our regulated subsidiaries as of december  are summarized as follows regulated subsidiaries statutory net worth as reported statutory net worth as required dollars in millions health net of california  inc managed health network health net life insurance company health net of arizona  inc health net health plan of oregon  inc health net of connecticut  inc health net insurance of connecticut  inc health net of new jersey  inc health net of new york  inc health net insurance of new york  inc mhn reinsurance company of arizona  inc all other includes gem insurance company sold effective february   health net services bermuda ltd  and health net of pennsylvania  inc as necessary  we make contributions to and issue standby letters of credit on behalf of our subsidiaries to meet risk based capital or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations 
health net  inc 
table of contents contributed million to certain of its subsidiaries to meet capital requirements during the year ended december  of the million  we contributed million to our new jersey health plan  million to our bermuda subsidiary and million to our insurance company in new york 
except for the million in capital contributions  our parent company did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiaries to meet risk based capital or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations during the year ended december  or thereafter through the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
legislation has been or may be enacted in certain states in which our subsidiaries operate imposing substantially increased minimum capital and or statutory deposit requirements for hmos in such states 
such statutory deposits may only be drawn upon under limited circumstances relating to the protection of policyholders 
as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements  certain subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies 
such restrictions  unless amended or waived  or unless regulatory approval is granted  limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations 
the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus  statutory income and unassigned surplus 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and market risk primarily due to our investing and borrowing activities 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and in equity prices 
interest rate risk is a consequence of maintaining variable interest rate earning investments and fixed rate liabilities or fixed income investments and variable rate liabilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risks arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  prepayment speeds and or the shape and slope of the yield curve 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential that changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception may affect the value of financial instruments 
we have several bond portfolios to fund reserves 
we attempt to manage the interest rate risks related to our investment portfolios by actively managing the asset liability duration of its investment portfolios 
the overall goal for the investment portfolios is to provide a source of liquidity and support the ongoing operations of our business units 
our philosophy is to actively manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
each business unit has additional requirements with respect to liquidity  current income and contribution to surplus 
we manage these risks by setting risk tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among assets and asset characteristics  and using performance measurement and reporting 
we use a value at risk var model  which follows a variance co variance methodology  to assess the market risk for our investment portfolio 
var is a method of assessing investment risk that uses standard statistical techniques to measure the worst expected loss in the portfolio over an assumed portfolio disposition period under normal market conditions 
the determination is made at a given statistical confidence level 
we assumed a portfolio disposition period of days with a confidence level of for the computation of var for the computation further assumes that the distribution of returns is normal 
based on such methodology and assumptions  the computed var was approximately million as of december our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that could be recognized on our investment portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and are not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon 
table of contents actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our investment portfolios during the year 
we believe  however  that any loss incurred would be substantially offset by the effects of interest rate movements on our liabilities  since these liabilities are affected by many of the same factors that affect asset performance  that is  economic activity  inflation and interest rates  as well as regional and industry factors 
in addition to the market risk associated with its investments  we have interest rate risk due to our fixed rate borrowings 
we use interest rate swap contracts swap contracts as a part of our hedging strategy to manage certain exposures related to the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our senior notes 
on february   we entered into four swap contracts related to the senior notes 
under the swap contracts  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
the swap contracts are entered into with a number of major financial institutions in order to reduce counterparty credit risk 
the swap contracts have an aggregate principal notional amount of million and effectively convert the fixed interest rate on the senior notes to a variable rate equal to the six month london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the swap contracts 
the interest rate on borrowings under our senior credit facility  of which there were none as of december   is subject to change because of the varying interest rates that apply to borrowings under the senior credit facility 
for additional information regarding our senior credit facility  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our floating rate borrowings  if any  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these borrowings  if any  are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair value of our fixed rate borrowing as of december  was approximately million which was based on bid quotations from third party data providers 
the following table presents the expected cash outflows relating to market risk sensitive debt obligations as of december  these cash outflows include both expected principal and interest payments consistent with the terms of the outstanding debt as of december  prior to entering into the swap contracts 
thereafter total amounts in millions fixed rate borrowing principal interest valuation of interest rate swap contracts a cash outflow on fixed rate borrowing a expected cash inflow outflow from swap contracts as of the most recent practicable date of february  is million  million  million  million  million and million for     and thereafter  respectively
