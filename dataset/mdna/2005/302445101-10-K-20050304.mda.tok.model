item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview flir was founded in  originally providing infrared imaging systems that were installed on vehicles for use in conducting energy audits of neighborhoods by helping to determine whether there was any abnormal leakage of heat coming from the doors  windows  walls and roofs of each house 
as demand for that application declined  the company began to focus on other applications and markets for its technology  in particular  designing and selling stabilized thermal imaging systems for aircraft used by law enforcement 
since then  the company has continued to develop thermal imaging products for a growing number of applications and has now become one of the world leaders in the design  manufacture and marketing of thermal imaging and stabilized camera systems for a wide variety of applications in the commercial  industrial and government markets  internationally as well as domestically 
our business is now organized around two principal business segments  thermography and imaging 
the thermography market primarily consists of the use of hand held thermal imaging systems that can detect and measure minute temperature differences  which is useful for a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications 
uses for our thermography products include predictive and preventative maintenance  process control  condition monitoring  moisture detection and scientific analysis 
in  we introduced a new inexpensive product line  known as the e series  that has increased the number of markets and applications that thermography serves 
our thermography products are produced at our facilities in sweden and santa barbara 
a growing distribution network has enabled us to penetrate existing and developing markets and applications worldwide 
our imaging business offers a wide array of products  all of which allow the user to see in total darkness  and through many types of obscurants  such as smoke  haze and most types of fog 
product offerings include hand held and fixed mounted products for ground  airborne and maritime applications 
applications for our imaging products include force protection  counter terrorism  search and rescue  perimeter security  navigation safety  law enforcement  narcotics detection  maritime and border patrol  electronic news gathering  anti piracy and firefighting 
our imaging products are primarily produced at our portland  boston  santa barbara and sweden facilities 
a substantial portion of our revenue in the imaging business is derived from sales to government agencies and we are continuing to expand our military program business  both in the united states and internationally 
on january   we completed the acquisition of indigo systems corporation indigo which is located in goleta santa barbara  california 
indigo is a leading producer of infrared detectors  infrared cameras  and camera subsystems 
the acquisition of indigo provides us with the ability to design and produce infrared detectors for both our imaging and thermography business 
indigo also allows us to expand our presence in certain markets  including high end scientific cameras  oem s and certain military program markets 
international revenue accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue 
with the production and distribution of our thermography products in sweden contributing a large volume of sales denominated in foreign currencies  we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
during  there were significant fluctuations in the values of the major currencies in which we conduct business  in particular  a weakening of the us dollar 
the impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements  but in aggregate  did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
the company typically experiences longer payment cycles on its international sales  which can have an adverse impact upon the company s liquidity 
in addition  substantial portions of the company s operations are conducted outside the united states  including manufacturing in sweden and sales operations worldwide 

table of contents international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and general economic conditions 
the company experiences fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles  such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the us and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement by certain customers to take delivery of equipment prior to the end of december due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration 
such events have resulted and could continue to result in certain fluctuations in quarterly results in the future 
as a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results  the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  investments  goodwill impairment  warranty obligations  contingencies and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price and with a reasonable assurance of collection  passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations  pursuant to guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december we typically design  market and sell our products as commercial  off the shelf products 
many of our imaging customers  particularly those who use our airborne systems  request different system configurations  based on standard options or accessories that we offer 
in general  our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria 
in those limited circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate the system meets those specifications prior to shipment 
for any contracts with multiple elements ie  training  installation  additional parts undelivered at the end of a reporting period  we recognize revenue on the delivered elements only after we have determined that the delivered elements have stand alone value and any undelivered elements have objective and reliable evidence of fair value 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that the risk of uncollectibility is minimal 
we also have a limited number of design and development contracts  principally with governmental customers  that are accounted for in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
under sop  revenues and related costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
actual write offs during the past three years have been insignificant 
we also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
we believe our reported allowances at december   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made 
inventory write downs 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology infrared systems  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventories becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory write downs when conditions exist that suggest that our inventories may be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our write downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value 
as of december   our inventories of million are stated net of inventory write downs of million 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
cost basis investments 
flir has invested in two third party entities 
the investments are accounted for on a cost basis since we do not have controlling interests in these entities nor do we have the ability to exercise significant influence on them 
as of december   we have carrying values of these investments of approximately million 
we periodically review the investments for impairment to determine if events or changes in the business conditions of those entities indicate the carrying value of our investments may not be recoverable 
these reviews may be based upon factors that include  but are not limited to  hypothetical liquidations of the investees at book value and current or recent financings received by the investees 
if future changes in business results or market conditions indicate that any impairment  other than temporary  exists on these investments  we may need to record reserves against those investments 
goodwill impairment 
the company recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisition of agema infrared systems ab in and our acquisition of indigo in during the year ended december   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
we review goodwill in june of each year  or on an interim basis if required  for impairment to determine if events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future 
table of contents cash flows we expect the assets to generate within the boundary of the overall market capitalization of the company 
our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for the goodwill assets  which have a carrying value of million as of december  in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources in the future which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time  generally twelve months  at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at december   is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
income taxes 
we record our deferred tax assets at an amount that we determine is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the future 
in making that determination  we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon  but not limited to  general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other factors beyond our control 
as of december   we have determined that no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million is required 
if we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses earnings from operations interest expense interest income other expense  net earnings before income taxes income tax provision net earnings 
table of contents years ended december   and revenue 
revenue for totaled million  an increase of over the million in revenue in revenue from the imaging business segment increased from million in to million in revenue from the thermography business segment increased from million in to million in the increase in imaging revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes arising from strong demand in virtually all markets  and to the revenue provided through our acquisition of indigo in january 
the increase in thermography revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes  particularly of e series  p series and a series products  due to new and emerging markets and the increased penetration by our expanding distribution network 
revenue for totaled million  an increase of over the million in revenue reported in revenue from the imaging business segment increased from million in to million in revenue from the thermography business segment increased from million in to million in the increase in imaging revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes  particularly in our maritime products  and a shift in the mix of shipments of our ground based  law enforcement and broadcast products to higher priced systems 
the thermography revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes  particularly the e series products and in the predictive maintenance market segments 
the unit increases are due to increases in capital spending as worldwide economies have improved and also due to penetration into new markets and the identification of additional applications 
approximately one fifth of the increase in total revenue  as well as the increase in both segments  were due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates during international revenue in totaled million  representing of revenue 
this compares to international revenue in which totaled million  representing of revenue  and million  or of revenue in while the sales mix between domestic and international sales may fluctuate slightly from year to year  we anticipate the mix to be approximately to domestic and to international on a long term basis 
gross profit 
gross profit in was of revenue  compared to in the gross profit for included million of amortization expense attributable to developed technology intangibles acquired as part of the acquisition of indigo and million of expense related to the recognition of the one time stepped up values of the acquired inventories of indigo 
without these charges  gross profit in as a percentage of revenue was 
the remaining decrease in gross profit is due to lower gross profits currently for our indigo products and a change in the mix of revenue between the imaging and thermography businesses  as thermography revenue represented of total revenue in compared to in we historically experience higher gross margins in our thermography business than in our imaging business 
offsetting a portion of these factors were manufacturing improvements and efficiencies implemented within the imaging operations 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit in was  compared to in the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the increase in the thermography business over the imaging business as a percentage of revenue 
in  the thermography revenue was of total revenue  compared to of total revenue in the increased use of distributors  whose commissions are reported as a reduction of revenue  in the thermography business has partially offset the increase in gross profit percentage attributable to the change in the mix between the business segments 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in the significant increase in spending in is due to the research and development expenses of indigo and the continued growth in spending related to our existing imaging and thermography businesses 
we believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business 
we expect research and development expenses to represent to of our revenue on a long term basis 
research and development expenses were million during compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased slightly from in to in 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue in compared to million  or of revenue in the significant increase in spending in is due to the indigo acquisition  including amortization expense of million for certain customer and trademark intangible assets acquired  and due to the growth in the company s business during the past year 
the decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue was a result of the revenue increase during the year and the ability to manage spending growth at a lower level than the revenue growth 
we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses in the future to increase at a slower rate than revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million  or of revenue  in to million  or of revenue  in interest expense 
interest expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest from to is primarily due to the interest on the convertible notes that were issued in june interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to a decrease in invested cash as a result of the indigo acquisition at the beginning of the increase in interest income in was due to the invested cash for the second half of the year as a result of the june issuance of the convertible notes 
other expense 
the company reported other expenses of million  million and million for  and the increase in other expense in and over was due to currency losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the company s european operations as the european currencies strengthened significantly against the us dollar during and income taxes 
the company s income tax provision was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the mix in taxable income between the company s us and foreign operations impacted the income tax provisions in each of these years 
the lower rate in was a result of the change in the company s valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets in related to our assessment of the ability to realize the deferred tax assets generated by prior tax loss benefits 
at december   the company had us tax net operating loss carryforwards nol s totaling million which expire in the years through additionally  the company has various us tax credits available aggregating million  which expire in the years through the company has generated deductions for us tax purposes related to the exercise of stock options that have served to offset the reductions in its nol s 
the utilization of these stock option exercise deductions is accounted for as a direct increase in additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction in the company s tax provision 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes requires that the tax benefits described above be recorded as assets to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not  otherwise  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
based on this guidance  management believes that the deferred tax assets of million reflected on the december  consolidated balance sheet  is realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income over a relatively short time horizon and has not recorded a valuation allowance 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon general economic conditions  including but not limited to continued growth of the thermography and imaging markets  competitive pressures on sales and gross margins  successful implementation of tax planning strategies  and other factors beyond the company s control 
absolute assurance can not be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for full utilization of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in future periods if its future forecasts of taxable income are not achieved 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily from cash used for the acquisition of indigo and other capital expenditures  partially offset by the cash provided from operations 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled million compared to million in the increase in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net earnings in and the increase in the income tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options 
at december   the company had accounts receivable in the amount of million compared to million at december  the increase of million in the receivable balance was primarily due to the inclusion of accounts receivable at indigo of million at december  and an increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of at december   the company had inventories of million compared to million at december  the increase in inventories was primarily due to the inclusion of inventory at indigo of million at december  and the continued growth of the business 
at december   the company had prepaid expenses and other current assets of million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to a net increase in the number of demonstration units  offset by a decrease in supplier advances 
deferred tax assets decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was primarily related to the deferred tax liabilities recorded in relation to the indigo acquisition 
the company s investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily arising from the acquisition of indigo for million  net of cash acquired  and capital expenditures of million 
investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  including the purchase of a new building for the boston operations for million 
accounts payable increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase relates to the increase in inventories  the general growth of the company s business and million of indigo s accounts payable at december  accrued payroll and related liabilities increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase was primarily due to accrued payroll of indigo of million at december   the timing of payroll payments  and increases in commissions and incentives arising from the sales and earnings growth in advance payments at december  were million  a decrease of million from the end of the decrease was due to revenue recorded on orders for which advance payments had been previously received  primarily in europe 
on april   the company signed an amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement with bank of america  na  union bank of california  na  and na bank national association 
the agreement provides for a million  five year revolving line of credit  with an option for an additional million until april  under the credit agreement  borrowings will bear interest based upon the prime lending rate of the bank of america or eurodollar rates with a provision for a spread under over such rates based upon the company s leverage ratio 
at december   the interest rate ranged from to 
the credit agreement contains four financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios  in addition to minimum levels of ebitda and consolidated net worth and a maximum level of capital expenditures  and is collateralized by substantially all assets of the company 
at december   the company had no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and was in compliance with these four 
table of contents financial covenants 
the company had million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement at december   which reduces the total available credit 
the company  through two of its subsidiaries  has a million swedish kroner approximately million line of credit at and a million line of credit at at december  at december   the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines 
the million swedish kroner line of credit is secured primarily by accounts receivable and inventories of the company s sweden subsidiary and is subject to automatic renewal on an annual basis 
the million line of credit is secured by substantially all assets of the company s united kingdom subsidiary and is subject to renegotiation annually 
in june  the company issued million of senior convertible notes due in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the issuance was made through an initial offering of million on june   and the subsequent exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional million on june  the net proceeds from the issuance were approximately million 
issuance costs will be amortized over a period of seven years 
interest is payable semiannually on june and december of each year  beginning on december  the holders of the notes may convert all or some of their notes into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes prior to the maturity date in certain circumstances 
the company may redeem for cash all or part of the notes on or after june  the proceeds were used primarily for general corporate purposes  which included the acquisition of indigo and other working capital and capital expenditure needs 
during the quarter ended september   one of the terms that allow for conversion of the company s convertible notes  as described in the prospectus  was met 
the company s stock closed at a price higher than per share for no fewer than of the last trading days during the quarter ended september  as of december   no note holders have elected to convert their notes into company stock 
the company does not anticipate any conversions before on november   the company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to purchase a building and related land in wilsonville  oregon 
the purchase price is million  payable in cash  and the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of we believe that our existing cash combined with the cash we anticipate to generate from operating activities  and our available credit facilities and financing available from other sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company does not have any significant commitments nor are we aware of any significant events or conditions that are likely to have a material impact on the company s liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we leased our non owned facilities under operating lease agreements 
we also leased certain operating machinery and equipment and office equipment under operating lease agreements 
except for these operating lease agreements  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations as of december   the company s contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases post retirement obligations 
table of contents payments for the company s post retirement obligations are based upon actuarial assumptions 
actual payments may differ in terms of both timing and amounts 
risk factors in addition to the factors discussed in the forward looking statements section provided at the beginning of this annual report on form k  the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
in addition  you should know that the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant 
if we were unable to adequately respond to any risks  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  we cannot be certain or give any assurances that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will work 
fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results make it difficult to predict our future performance 
our quarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
due to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
factors that may affect our future operating results include the timing  number and size of orders from  and shipments to  our customers  as well as the relative mix of those orders  variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter  which can be substantial  may result in variations in revenue and gross margins  a significant portion of our sales are made in the last month of each quarter  with sales frequently concentrated in the last week or days of the quarter  the timing and market acceptance of our or our competitors new products  product enhancements or technologies  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of critical components  the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products  changes in our or our competitors pricing policies  our ability to collect on trade receivables  the timing and amount of any inventory write downs  foreign currency fluctuations  the ability to secure export licenses for international sales orders  costs and risks associated with the acquisition and integration of other businesses  product lines or technologies  and general economic conditions  both domestically and internationally 
seasonal fluctuations in our operating results  particularly the increase in sales we generally experience every year in the fourth quarter  result from the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement of international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to january due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration 

table of contents we may be unable to successfully integrate indigo systems  or any future acquisition or equity investment  into our operations  thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations 
in january  we completed the acquisition of indigo systems corporation  which is located in goleta santa barbara  california 
we have begun to integrate indigo s cooled and uncooled infrared detectors into our thermography and imaging products  thereby lowering our product costs  and have begun selling some of indigo s infrared camera cores and camera systems 
this integration of businesses  personnel  product lines and technologies is typically difficult  time consuming and subject to a number of risks 
for example  the integration of indigo infrared detectors into our existing products requires extensive engineering and manufacturing effort that may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful 
further  the integration of products and product lines requires the coordination of research and development  manufacturing  sales  marketing and service efforts between the company and indigo or any future acquisitions 
because the indigo acquisition occurred last year  we have had limited experience managing their operations 
additionally  we could lose key personnel from indigo or any future companies that we acquire  incur unanticipated costs and assume new liabilities 
any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and decrease our revenue 
furthermore  we might have to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders ownership 
while there are currently no such acquisitions planned or being negotiated  we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and may in the near or long term pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses  product lines or technologies 
as a result  no assurance can be given that we will realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of indigo  or any future acquisition or equity investment  or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are under a cease and desist order from the sec  a violation of which could harm our business 
on june   the sec issued a formal order of investigation of us and certain officers  directors  employees and other individuals presently and formerly associated with us to determine whether any violations of the federal securities laws occurred during and the investigation relates to our revenue recognition policies  accounting controls  financial reports and other public disclosures during that time period 
pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by us on september   the sec instituted and simultaneously settled a proceeding against us under section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section c of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
without admitting or denying the allegations of the sec s order  we agreed to the entry of an order requiring that we cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities act and the antifraud  periodic reporting  record keeping and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws set forth in section a of the securities act and sections b  a  b a and b b of the exchange act and rules b  b  a and a thereunder 
we incurred no financial fine or penalty under the terms of settlement 
the sec s order cited material misstatements and omissions in the financial statements originally filed for and in and  we restated our financial statements for and no further restatements of our financial statements were required by the order  and the entry of the order did not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
should we be found to have violated the terms of the sec s order in the future  we may be subject to further enforcement action  including legal action imposing injunctive relief and assessing fines or penalties  which could have a material impact on our business 
a reduction in government purchasing or our inability to act as a united states government contractor could significantly decrease revenue 
the government procurement process is complex and highly competitive 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to united states and foreign government agencies  and our business will continue 
table of contents to be substantially dependent upon such sales 
no sales to a single agency of the united states government accounted for more than of our revenue  but aggregate sales to united states government agencies accounted for and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
accordingly  our results of operations would be adversely impacted by governmental spending cuts and general budgetary constraints 
in addition  we are seeking to secure additional government contracts for the design and long term supply of commercially developed military qualified thermal imaging devices 
if we are not successful in winning such contracts  or do not perform our obligations on any such contracts we do secure  our future operating results may be adversely affected 
our ability to do business with the united states government is conditioned upon our continuing eligibility to act as a federal contractor 
a significant decline in our sales to united states or foreign governments or our disqualification from making such sales for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete 
the market for thermal imaging equipment is characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions  enhancements and modifications 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to develop new technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements 
we may need to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to develop and introduce new products and enhancements 
if we fail to develop and introduce new technologies in a timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
from time to time  we or our competitors may announce new products  product enhancements or technological innovations that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of our products and that may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products  resulting in inventory obsolescence 
we must successfully introduce new or enhanced products and manage the costs associated with producing numerous product lines to be successful 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our existing products and to develop new products using the latest technology that can satisfy customer requirements 
for example  our near term success will depend on the continued acceptance of our major product lines such as the star safire imaging product line and the thermacam p series and e series thermography product lines  sales of which we expect to generate a substantial amount of our revenue 
we are also investing a significant amount of our financial resources in the enhancement of some of our other existing products such as our search and surveillance products 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully complete these enhancements within the necessary time period or that customers will accept our new products  or any future products 
in addition  the complexity associated with the production of multiple product lines may inhibit our ability to maintain or improve our gross margins 
our failure to complete the enhancement of these products  the failure of our current or future products to gain or maintain market acceptance or our failure to successfully manage our cost of production could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition in the markets for thermal imaging equipment is intense and our failure to compete effectively would adversely affect our business 
competition in the markets for our products is intense 
the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging  develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors 
we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product features  performance  reliability and price 
additionally  our products compete indirectly with numerous other products  such as image intensifiers and low light cameras  for limited governmental and military funds 
finally  many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  research and development and marketing resources than we do 
all of these factors result in greater challenges from our existing competitors as well as increasing competition from new competitors and require us to continue to invest in  and focus on  
table of contents research and development and new product innovation 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers of components for our products and our transition to manufacturing our own cooled and uncooled infrared detectors exposes us to risks that could result in delays in satisfying customer demand  increased costs and loss of revenue 
we currently rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products 
we have completed the acquisition of indigo systems corporation  which manufactures cooled and uncooled infrared detectors  and intend to use those detectors in our thermography and imaging products 
during this transition to the use of indigo s infrared detectors  we could experience a shortage in the supply of some of our components including cooled and uncooled infrared detectors 
a prior contract that we had with bae systems bae gave us the exclusive right to purchase uncooled detectors for use in the commercial market and a limited  non exclusive right to purchase uncooled detectors for use in the government market 
with the conclusion of this contract  bae is no longer bound by this exclusivity requirement for the commercial market and we may not be able to successfully transition to the use of uncooled detectors from indigo 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event that we are unable to transition to uncooled detectors manufactured by indigo within the expected time period or in the event the detectors we manufacture at indigo or receive from another supplier are defective or they do not otherwise meet our performance standards 
failure by us to transition to the use of cooled and uncooled detectors made by indigo  or identify another source of uncooled detectors in a timely manner  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
based on past experience  we expect to occasionally receive late deliveries or to experience inadequate supplies of certain components 
if the components manufactured by indigo or provided by any other significant supplier become unavailable  our manufacturing operations would be disrupted 
unless we have sufficient lead time and are otherwise able to identify and qualify acceptable replacement components or redesign our products with different components  we might not be able to obtain necessary components on a timely basis or at acceptable prices 
any extended interruption in the supply of sole or limited source components would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad  and the united states congress may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments 
export licenses are required from united states government agencies under the export administration act  the trading with the enemy act of and the arms export control act of for export of many of our products 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses 
recently  heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our market has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications 
failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to reduce our costs quickly enough if our sales decline 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future sales  and these expenses are largely fixed  particularly in the short term 
in addition  to enable us to promptly fill orders  we maintain inventories of finished goods  components and raw materials 
as a result  we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales 
accordingly  we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales 
any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods  components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write downs and write offs 
we may not carry adequate reserves to offset such write downs or write offs 

table of contents our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical and sales personnel 
our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and sales personnel 
significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key senior managerial  technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract  integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future 
we also cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have significantly increased our indebtedness as a result of the sale of the convertible notes 
in june  we issued million of senior convertible notes due in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of as a result of this indebtedness  our principal and interest payment obligations have increased substantially 
increased debt could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we face risks from international sales and currency fluctuations 
we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for  and are expected to continue to account for  a significant portion of our revenue 
for the years ended december  and  international sales accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenue 
our international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the imposition of governmental controls  restrictions on the export of critical technology  trade restrictions  difficulty in collecting receivables  inadequate protection of intellectual property  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  political and economic instability  and general economic conditions 
historically  currency fluctuations have affected our operating results 
changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales are denominated or costs incurred have in the past caused  and could in the future cause  fluctuations in our operating results 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating  where possible  our international sales in united states dollars 
with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars  a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive 
no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims 
we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions 
while we have not 
table of contents yet had to recall a product  if any of our products are defective  we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims 
such an event could result in significant expenses  disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  product defects could result in substantial product liability 
we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms 
our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
to accomplish this  we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
most of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents  making them more difficult to protect 
although we currently hold united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products  we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology  products and trade names 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors 
likewise  we cannot be certain that measures taken to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure 
any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  because intellectual property does not necessarily represent a barrier to entry into the thermal imaging industry  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours 
litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry 
we cannot be sure that we will not be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 
defending intellectual property lawsuits and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel 
an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding to which we may be a party could subject us to significant liabilities 
an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties 
if licenses were not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  our business could be harmed 
we would be harmed if we were unable to use one of our facilities 
we manufacture our products at facilities located in the portland  boston  stockholm and santa barbara areas 
our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of  for example  an earthquake  a prolonged power shortage  fire or other natural disaster  would prevent us from supplying products to our customers  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover  even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders 
other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us 
an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders  including an increase in the value of our common stock 
some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  including our shareholder rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders  as well as provisions of oregon law  may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its credit agreements 
the credit agreements are at variable rates 
a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows 
at december   no amounts were outstanding on any of the company s credit agreements  consequently  no sensitivity analysis is presented 
the company s convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
the fair value of the notes at december   was approximately million compared to a carrying value of million 
the company has assets  liabilities  and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
similarly  certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are sold in foreign currencies 
assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom 
the company s investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are considered long term 
the company does not engage in forward currency exchange contracts to reduce its economic exposure to changes in exchange rates 
because the company markets  sells and licenses our products throughout the world  it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products 
our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december   was approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  our net investment in foreign subsidiaries at december  was million and the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates was million 
the increase in the potential loss in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries 
the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings
