critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will be utilized to benefit the operations of the company 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
long lived assets 
long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows are judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
if the company s estimates or the underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
warranty 
in the normal course of business the company issues product warranties for specific product lines and provides for the estimated future warranty cost in the period in which the sale is recorded 
the estimate of warranty cost is based on contract terms and historical warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience 
because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information  claims costs may differ from amounts provided 
adjustments to initial obligations for warranties are made as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable 
litigation 
from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to products  suppliers  employees  customers and competitors 
the company maintains insurance to cover product liability  workers compensation  property and casualty  and general liability matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after assessment of each matter and the related insurance coverage 
the reserve requirements may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes 
the company operates in numerous foreign and domestic taxing jurisdictions where it is subject to various types of tax  including sales tax and income tax 
the company s tax filings are subject to audits and adjustments 
because of the nature of the company s operations  the nature of the audit items can be complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same transaction or income in more than one state or country 
as part of the company s calculation of the provision for taxes  the company establishes reserves for the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments related to the various tax matters

this statement is effective for interim periods beginning after june  the company will apply this guidance prospectively 
the company is in the process of determining what impact the application of this guidance will have on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows certain risk factors that may affect future results level of indebtedness 
the company has and will continue to have a significant amount of debt 
as of january   the company had million of borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding 
to the extent capital resources are required  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
the unavailability of funds could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and the ability to expand operations 
the level of indebtedness could adversely affect the company in a number of ways  including the following the company may be unable to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  a significant portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service  which reduces the amount of cash we have available for other purposes  the company may be more vulnerable to a downturn in business or economic and industry conditions  the company may be disadvantaged as compared to its competitors  such as in the ability to adjust to changing market conditions  as a result of the significant amount of debt the company owes  and the company may be restricted in its ability to make strategic acquisitions and to pursue business opportunities 
restrictions under debt agreements 
the covenants in the company s existing credit agreement contain a number of significant limitations on its ability to  among other things pay dividends  incur additional indebtedness  create liens on the company s assets  engage in new lines of business  make investments  make capital expenditures and enter into leases  and acquire or dispose of assets 
these restrictive covenants  among others  could negatively affect the company s ability to finance future capital needs  engage in other business activities or withstand a future downturn in business or the economy 
under the company s credit agreement  the company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet financial tests  including certain ratios of leverage and fixed charge coverage 
the company s ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by matters beyond its control  and as a result  the company cannot assure that it will be able to meet these ratios and tests 
a breach of any of these covenants would prevent the company from being able to draw under its revolver and will result in a default under the credit agreement 
in the event of a default under the credit agreement  the lenders could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable 
the company may be unable to pay these debts in these circumstances 
competition 
the foodservice equipment industry is highly competitive 
competition is based on product features and design  brand recognition  reliability  durability  technology  energy efficiency  breadth of product offerings  delivery lead times  serviceability and after sale service  price and customer relationships 
there are a number of competitors in each product line that the company offers 
many competitors are substantially larger and enjoy substantially greater financial  marketing  technological and personnel resources 
these factors may enable them to develop similar or superior products  to provide lower cost products and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than the company can 
in addition  some competitors focus on particular product lines or geographical regions or emphasize their local manufacturing presence or local market knowledge 
some competitors have different pricing structures and may be able to deliver their products at lower prices 
although the company believes that the performance and price characteristics of its products will provide competitive solutions for its customers needs  there can be no assurance that the company s customers will continue to choose its products over products offered by its competitors 
further  the market for the company s products is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the company s ability to compete in the past has depended in part on the company s ability to develop innovative new products and bring them to market more quickly than its competitors 
the company s ability to compete successfully will depend  in large part  on its ability to enhance and improve existing products  to continue to bring innovative products to market in a timely fashion  to adapt products to the needs and standards of customers and potential customers 
moreover  competitors may develop technologies or products that render the company s products obsolete or less marketable 
if the company s products  markets and services are not competitive  the company s business  financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 
dependence on key customers 
the company has depended  and will continue to depend  on key customers for a material portion of its revenues 
many of the company s key customers are large restaurant chains 
the number of new store openings by these chains can vary from quarter to quarter depending on internal growth plans  construction  seasonality and other factors 
if these chains were to conclude that the market for their type of restaurant has become saturated  they could open fewer restaurants 
in addition  during an economic downturn  key customers could both open fewer restaurants and defer purchases of new equipment for existing restaurants 
either of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
international exposure 
the company has manufacturing operations located in asia and distribution operations in asia  europe and latin america 
the company s operations are subject to the impact of economic downturns  political instability and foreign trade restrictions  which may adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of consolidated net sales in the foreseeable future 
some sales by the foreign operations are in local currency  and an increase in the relative value of the us dollar against such currencies would lead to the reduction in consolidated sales and earnings 
additionally  foreign currency exposures are not fully hedged  and there can be no assurances that future results of operations will not be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
strategic investments 
to achieve strategic objectives  the company may in the future seek to acquire or invest in other companies  businesses or technologies 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including the following difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses or technologies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  assumption of unknown material liabilities  failure to achieve financial or operating objectives  and potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired companies 
the company may not be able to integrate successfully any operations  personnel  services or products that the company has acquired or may acquire in the future 
the company also may seek to expand or enhance some of its operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world 
entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks  including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures  exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which the company does not have a controlling interest  and potential conflicts with joint venture or alliance partners 
sources of supply 
the company uses large amounts of stainless steel  aluminized steel  and other commodities in the manufacture of its products 
a significant increase in the prices of these commodities that the company is unable to pass on to customers would adversely affect its operating results 
while the company has some supply contracts  the protection they provide is limited  so that the company remains exposed to price increases 
in addition  an interruption in or the cessation of an important supply by any third party and the company s inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
intellectual property 
the company relies primarily on trade secret  copyright  service mark  trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect its proprietary technology and other proprietary rights 
the company has filed patent applications covering its technology 
notwithstanding the precautions the company takes to protect its intellectual property rights  it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use its proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on the company s rights 
in some cases  including a number of the company s most important products  there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors 
in addition  in the future  the company may have to rely on litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights  protect trade secrets  determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources  either of which could adversely affect the business 
patent infringement 
patents of third parties may have an important bearing on the company s ability to offer certain of its products and services 
the company s competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain  and may be expected to obtain in the future  patents related to the types of products and services the company offers or plans to offer 
the company cannot assure that it is or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by its products and services 
in addition  some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and  therefore  the company cannot evaluate the extent to which its products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications 
in general  if one or more of the company s products or services were to infringe patents held by others  the company may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services  to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims 
the company cannot assess the extent to which it may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others  whether such licenses would be available or  if available  whether the company would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
if the company were unable to obtain such licenses  the company may not be able to redesign its products or services to avoid infringement  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
product liability matters 
the company s business exposes it to potential liability risks that arise from the manufacturing  marketing and sale of its products 
in addition to direct expenditures for damages  settlement and defense costs  there is a possibility of adverse publicity as a result of product liability claims 
product liability is a significant commercial risk 
some plaintiffs have received substantial damage awards in some jurisdictions against companies based upon claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products 
in addition  it may be necessary to recall products that do not meet approved specifications  which would also result in costs connected to the recall and loss of revenue 
the company cannot assure that a product liability claim or series of claims brought against it would not have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
if any claim is brought against the company  regardless of the success or failure of the claim  the company cannot assure that it will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities or the cost of a recall 
fluctuations in financial performance 
the company s financial performance is subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors  including the lengthy  unpredictable sales cycle for commercial cooking equipment  the gain or loss of significant customers  unexpected delays in new product introductions  level of market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  unexpected changes in the levels of the company s operating expenses  competitive product offerings and pricing actions  and general economic conditions 
the occurrence of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental exposure 
the company s operations are regulated under a number of federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling  storage and disposal of these materials 
in the event of a violation of environmental laws  the company could be held liable for damages and for the costs of remedial actions 
environmental laws could also become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation  which could negatively affect operating results 
disruption in production from unionized workforce 
because the company has a significant number of workers whose employment is subject to collective bargaining agreements and labor union representation  the company is vulnerable to possible organized work stoppages and similar actions 
unionized employees accounted for approximately of the company s workforce as of january  at the company s elgin  illinois facility  the company has a union contract with the international brotherhood of teamsters that extends through april the company also has a union workforce at its manufacturing facility in the philippines  under a contract that extends through june although the company believes that the current relationships between employees  union and management are good  any future strikes  employee slowdowns or similar actions by one or more unions  in connection with labor contract negotiations or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on its ability to operate the business 
dependence on key personnel 
the company depends significantly on certain of the company s executive officers and certain other key personnel  many of whom could be difficult to replace 
while the company has employment agreements with certain key executives  the company cannot assure that it will succeed in retaining personnel 
the incapacity  inability or unwillingness of certain of these people to perform their services may have a material adverse effect on the company 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel within the industry  and the company cannot assure that it will be able to continue to attract  motivate and retain personnel with the skills and experience needed to successfully manage the company s business and operations
