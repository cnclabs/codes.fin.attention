item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the principal factors affecting the results of our operations and the significant changes in our balance sheet items on a consolidated basis for the periods listed  as well as liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements  related notes and selected historical financial data 
recent developments over the past months  the board and management of the company considered a variety of strategic alternatives that might provide it with adequate financing to pursue its growth strategies for the health services business it embarked on in and maximize long term shareholder value 
after considering various options  management  in early  committed to the sale of of standard life  including dixie life 
pursuant to this decision and following months of negotiating  on february   standard management entered into a definitive stock and asset purchase agreement the agreement with capital assurance corporation capital assurance 
the agreement provides for the sale to capital assurance of i of the capital stock of standard life  and ii million aggregate principal amount of surplus debentures issued by standard life in favor of standard management 
the agreement represents the definitive terms for the transactions contemplated by the previously reported letter of intent between the parties 
standard management expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of the purchase price under the agreement is million  subject to adjustment as described below  which will be payable as follows i million of a new class of cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of capital assurance  ii assumption by capital assurance of approximately million in intercompany obligations of standard management to standard life and iii the balance of the purchase price in cash 
the cash portion of the purchase price will be adjusted  post closing  based on certain changes in the business of standard life occurring between october  and the closing of the transaction  including adjustments for  among other things  statutory gains from operations of standard life  credit related capital gains and losses  including impairment losses  principal payments on the surplus debentures and capital expenditures by standard life 
management currently estimates that based on anticipated adjustments  the post closing  as adjusted purchase price will be approximately million 
standard management and capital assurance have made customary representations  warranties and covenants in the agreement  including  among others  covenants by standard management i to conduct the business of standard life in the ordinary course and maintain necessary permits and insurance policies during the interim period between the execution of the agreement and closing  ii to not engage in certain types of transactions during such period  iii to cause a meeting of the shareholders of standard management to be held to approve the agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby  iv to not solicit proposals relating to an alternative sale or business combination transaction and v subject to certain exceptions  not to enter into discussions concerning or provide confidential information in connection with proposals for alternative sale or business combination transactions 
in addition  standard management has agreed to purchase certain assets from standard life at closing for approximately million 
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement is subject to customary conditions  including i approval of the shareholders of standard management  ii absence of any law or order prohibiting the closing  iii approval of the indiana department of insurance  and iv expiration or termination of the hart scott rodino waiting period 
in addition  each party s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the agreement is subject to certain customary conditions  including i with certain exceptions  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party and ii material compliance of the other party with its covenants 
standard management also agreed to undertake a solicitation of the preferred security holders of sman capital trust i  a wholly owned subsidiary of standard management the trust at an estimated cost of approximately million to fund incentive payments in connection with obtaining the consent of the trust preferred holders 
if adopted  the amendment would provide us additional financing flexibility by allowing us to enter into certain business transactions  such as the sale of substantially all of our assets  without the acquirer of such assets being required to assume our responsibilities under the indenture 
in the event the requisite consents to amend the indenture are not received  standard management has the right to require capital assurance to assume standard management s obligations under the indenture 
if this event were to occur  standard management would receive less net cash proceeds from the sale of standard life by the net face amount outstanding of the trust preferred securities 

table of contents also in this agreement  standard management agreed to indemnify capital assurance and standard life for any losses arising from breaches of any representation or warranty of standard management made in the agreement subject to the applicable survival periods and for certain allocated tax losses  if any of such losses exceed  in the aggregate 
if such indemnification threshold is exceeded  standard management would be responsible for paying  plus the amount of such loss in excess of  up to a maximum amount equal to the purchase price for losses related to the breach of certain representations and warranties  and up to a maximum amount equal to of the purchase price for breaches of certain other specified representations and warranties 
in addition  standard management agreed to indemnify capital assurance and standard life for losses arising out of any litigation pending against standard life as of the closing date to the extent the loss exceeds standard life s litigation reserve  for any breach of the covenants and agreements made by standard management in the agreement and for certain other tax losses 
standard management has agreed to pledge the preferred stock to be received as part of the consideration in the transaction to secure up to million of indemnification liabilities 
capital assurance also agreed to indemnify us with respect to any breach of a representation  warranty or covenant made by it under the agreement  subject to the same limits and the applicable survival periods 
the agreement provides termination rights for both standard management and capital assurance  and further provides that  upon termination of the agreement under specified circumstances  standard management may be required to pay capital assurance a termination fee ranging from million to million  depending on the circumstance leading to the termination  plus reimbursement of up to million of expenses incurred by capital assurance in connection with the transaction since november  if the proposed sale is consummated  we estimate that  for federal income tax purposes  we will recognize a capital loss on the sale of approximately million  equal to the difference between our adjusted tax basis in standard life and the amount realized from the proposed sale 
we may recognize a tax benefit in future periods from this capital loss provided that we recognize capital gains within five years 
in addition  for accounting purposes  we would expect to record a loss on the sale of approximately million  which is equal to the difference between the expected net book value of the assets sold on the sale date and the purchase price expected to be paid by capital assurance in the proposed transaction  plus transaction related expenses 
standard management has filed with the sec preliminary proxy materials relating to i the special meeting of shareholders to be held for the purpose of approving the agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and ii the solicitation of consents from holders of trust preferred securities of sman capital trust i to an amendment to the indenture relating to such securities 
standard management has set may  as the date for a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the approval of the sale of its subsidiary  standard life  to capital assurance 
definitive proxy materials will be sent to all shareholders of record as of april  on or about april  if the sale of standard life is consummated  standard management will no longer operate in the insurance industry other than certain de minimis activities 
at such time  virtually all of our operations will consist of the business of our us health services subsidiary and its several operating subsidiaries which comprise our health services operations 
if the sale is consummated  standard life and its subsidiaries will be treated for accounting purposes as a discontinued operation of standard management and the financial statements for all prior periods will be restated to show the operations of standard life separately from standard management s continuing operations 
the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows provides a discussion of both of our historical business segments

overview historically we have specialized primarily in the sale of individual annuities 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  premium collections for annuities are reported as insurance policy liabilities instead of as revenues 
sources of revenues for products accounted for as insurance policy liabilities are net investment income  surrender charges deducted from the account balances of policyholders in connection with withdrawals  realized gains and losses on investments and call option income 
components of expenses for products accounted for as insurance policy liabilities are interest credited to account balances  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  and other operating costs and expenses 

table of contents earnings from products accounted for as insurance policy liabilities are primarily generated from the excess of net investment income earned over the interest credited to the policyholder  or the investment spread 
our investment spread is summarized as follows for the year ended december net investment yield on invested assets weighted average effective crediting rate investment spread our profitability depends in large part upon the amount of assets under our management  investment spreads we earn on our policyholders account balances  our ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes  defaults or impairment of assets  our ability to manage costs of the options purchased to fund the interest credits on our equity indexed annuities  our ability to manage the costs of acquiring new business principally commissions to agents and first year bonuses credited to policyholders and our ability to manage our operating expenses 
the weighted average effective credited rate represents interest on interest sensitive liabilities  including equity indexed annuities  offset by gains on call option assets used to mitigate changes in equity indexed annuity liabilities 
product profitability financial services the long term profitability of life insurance and annuity products depends on the accuracy of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such insurance products  and the ultimate profitability of such products  are based on four major factors mortality  persistency  return on cash invested by the insurer during the life of the policy and expenses of acquiring and administering the policies 
interest spreads represent a major profit source on annuity and interest sensitive life products 
margins on these products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  we are able to maintain spreads by adjusting credited interest rates for changes in our earned rates  subject to competitive and timing constraints 
however  there are corollary effects of interest rate changes 
rising interest rates result in a decline in the market value of assets  and also tend to result in increased policyholder surrenders as other investment options become relatively more attractive 
the effect of increased surrenders is to reduce earnings over the long term 
current period earnings effect may vary depending on the level of surrender charges and deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  and present value of future profits  or pvfp 
in addition  increasing interest rates give rise to disintermediation risk  the risk that assets must be sold at depressed values in order to fund increased surrender payments 
this risk is mitigated by properly matching assets and liabilities 
we seek to closely match the estimated duration of our invested assets to the expected duration of our liabilities 
when the estimated durations of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is minimized because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
a significant mismatch of the durations of invested assets and liabilities could have an impact on our future financial results 
declining interest rates generally have little immediate effect on our investment earnings rates 
over time  as we invest positive cash flows at lower rates  our earned rates decline 
in such an environment  we attempt to adjust credited interest rates accordingly  subject to competitive pressures 
in most situations  this action allows us to maintain our margins 
however  the sustained period of low interest rates may impact future interest spreads  results of operations and financial condition 
the average expected remaining life of standard life s traditional life and annuity business in force at december  was years 
this calculation was determined based upon our actuarial models and assumptions as to expected persistency and mortality 
persistency is the extent to which insurance policies sold are maintained by the insured 
the persistency of life insurance and annuity products is a critical element of their profitability 
however  a surrender charge often applies in the early contract years and declines to zero over time 

table of contents life insurance policyholders sometimes do not pay scheduled premiums  thus causing their policies to lapse 
for the years   and standard life experienced total policy lapses  excluding surrenders  of  and of total policies in force at december of each year  respectively 
ongoing premiums are not required for annuity policies  so annuities do not experience policy lapses 
variances between actual and expected profits 
actual experience on purchased and produced insurance may vary from projections due to differences in investment spreads  mortality costs  persistency  administrative costs and other factors 
variances from original projections  whether positive or negative  are included in net income as they occur 
to the extent that these variances indicate that future experience will differ from the estimated profits reflected in the capitalization and amortization of the pvfp and dac assets  current and future amortization rates may be adjusted 
product accounting present value of future profits 
in accordance with industry practice  when we purchase a block of existing insurance business which we have not done since  we assign a portion of the purchase price  pvfp  as the pre tax value of the business acquired 
the asset is the discounted value of future cash flows arising from the existing block of business 
the discount rate used is based upon many elements  such as yields generated on similar business  our cost of capital and the interest rate environment as of the purchase date 
discount rates used in determining our pvfp assets range from to 
after purchase  amortization of the asset occurs in proportion to profits emerging from the purchased policies 
the asset is amortized over the expected life of the block of business 
the percentages of expected net amortization of the beginning balance of the total pvfp asset as of december  are expected to be between and in each of the years through deferred policy acquisition costs 
insurance policies we issue ourselves will generate significant costs that vary directly with and relate to issuance of that new business 
under gaap  these acquisition costs on new policies are to be capitalized and recorded as dac 
for universal and interest sensitive life and annuity products  the dac asset is amortized in proportion to estimated gross profits over the life of the contract 
for immediate annuities  dac is amortized so as to produce a constant yield on the net policyholder liability 
virtually all of our dac is a result of writing annuity products 
net amortization of dac related to operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from the emergence of gross profits from business sold in recent years 
future expected amortization of dac  assuming no new business after december  and current assumptions  is as follows in thousands gross amortization interest accumulation net amortization accounting for deferred annuities and universal and interest sensitive life products 
we primarily account for our deferred annuity  universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses on the sale of investments 
under sfas  a benefit reserve is established at the time of policy issuance in an amount equal to the deposits received 
thereafter  the benefit reserve is adjusted for any additional deposits  interest credited and partial or complete withdrawals 
revenues for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life policies  other than certain non interest sensitive annuities  consist of policy charges for surrenders and partial withdrawals  mortality and administration  and investment income earned 
these revenues do not include the annuity  universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits 
expenses related to these products include interest credited to policyowner account balances  operating costs for policy administration  amortization of dac and mortality costs in excess of account balances 

table of contents costs relating to the acquisition of new business  primarily commissions paid to agents  which vary with and are directly related to the production of new business  are deferred to the extent that such costs are recoverable from future profit margins 
at the time of issuance the acquisition expenses  approximately of our initial annuity premium deposits are capitalized as dac 
in accordance with sfas  dac with interest is amortized over the lives of the policies in a constant relationship to the present value of estimated future gross profits 
accounting for equity indexed annuities 
revenues and expenses for equity indexed annuities are recognized in accordance with the sfas model  described above 
policy liabilities for equity indexed annuities are computed in accordance with sfas  which requires that an equity indexed annuity liability be bifurcated into a host contract and a derivative contract 
the host contract liability is a book value liability providing for the equity indexed annuity policy s guaranteed benefits 
the derivative contract liability is a market value liability providing for the equity linked benefits available in the policy 
the derivative liability includes a liability for equity linked benefits accruing during the current contract year  as well as liability amounts for future equity benefits which have not yet been granted 
accounting for traditional life products 
traditional life insurance products are accounted as long duration insurance contracts in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
under sfas  benefit reserves are actuarially calculated using the net level reserve method 
revenues consist of policy premiums and investment income on assets supporting policy liabilities 
expenses consist of policy benefits incurred  increases in policy liabilities  and operating costs for policy administration  and amortization of dac 
costs related to the acquisition of new business  primarily commissions paid to agents  which vary with and are directly related to the production of new business  are deferred to the extent that such costs are recoverable from future profit margins 
at the time of issuance  the acquisition expenses are capitalized as dac 
in accordance with sfas  dac with interest is amortized over the lives of the policies in a constant relationship to policy premiums 
accounting for immediate annuities 
immediate annuities with no life contingent payments  which comprise the majority of our immediate annuities in force and the majority of new immediate annuity sales  are accounted as investment contracts in accordance with sfas revenues consist of investment income  and expenses consist of the imputed interest credits to policies as well as operating costs for policy administration 
an initial net premium policy liability is established as initial premium less acquisition costs 
the imputed credited rate is the rate  which equates this net premium to the guaranteed payments 
after issue  the liability changes by the amount of imputed interest credits and benefit payments 
for balance sheet purposes  this net premium liability is presented as a gross premium liability offset by a dac asset 
immediate annuities with payments contingent on the survival of the annuitant are accounted as limited payment contracts in accordance with sfas  with revenue recognition  expense recognition  and liabilities computed as described above for traditional life products 
critical accounting policies the accounting polices described below require us to make significant estimates and assumptions using information available at the time the estimates are made 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
we have made estimates in the past that we believed to be appropriate but were subsequently revised to reflect actual experience 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
accordingly  we consider them to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of our accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
investments the carrying value of our investment portfolio was billion in financial services at december  the accounting risks associated with these assets relate to the recognition of income  our determination of other than temporary impairments and our estimation of fair values 

table of contents we amortize premiums and discounts as yield adjustments over the contractual lives of fixed maturity securities 
we consider anticipated prepayments on mortgage backed securities in determining estimated future yields on such securities 
when we sell a security  we report the difference between the sales proceeds and amortized cost determined based on specific identification as a realized investment gain or loss 
we periodically evaluate whether the declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
our evaluation consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
we also consider additional factors to determine whether the declines in fair value are other than temporary  such as downgrades of the security by a rating agency  deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  and other publicly available issuer specific news or general market conditions 
for investments in companies with no quoted market price  we consider similar qualitative and quantitative factors and also take into account the cost of the investment  the type of investment  subsequent purchases of the same or similar investments  the current financial position and operating results of the company invested in  and such other factors as may be relevant 
declines in fair values of securities deemed to be other than temporary are recognized as a realized loss 
determining what constitutes an other than temporary decline involves significant judgment 
declines in fair value below cost not considered other than temporary in the current period could be considered other than temporary in a future period and reduce earnings to the extent of the write down 
estimated fair values for our investments are determined based on estimates from nationally recognized pricing services  broker dealer market makers  and internally developed methods 
our internally developed methods require us to make judgments about the security s credit quality  liquidity and market spread 
equity indexed call options are derivative instruments linked to the major stock indices s p index and djia index which are used to mitigate changes in the equity benefits of our equity indexed annuity products 
we purchase call options whose payoff characteristics offset the equity benefits of our products 
these securities are carried at fair value and the change in fair value is included in net investment income 
dac and pvfp the combined balance of our dac and pvfp was million at december  the recovery of these costs is dependent on the future profitability of the related business 
each year  we evaluate the recoverability of the unamortized balance of the dac and pvfp 
we consider estimated future gross profits or future premiums  expected mortality or morbidity  interest earned and credited rates  persistency and expenses in determining whether the balance is recoverable 
if we determine a portion of the unamortized balance is not recoverable  it is charged to amortization expense 
the assumptions we use to amortize and evaluate the recoverability of the dac and pvfp involve significant judgment 
a significant revision to these assumptions will impact future financial results 
we recorded no charge for and a charge of million for related to the acceleration of dac amortization due to dac unlocking 
goodwill and intangible assets the balance of our goodwill and intangible assets was million at december  the recovery of this asset is dependent on the fair value of the business to which it relates 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests based on the estimated fair value of the business units 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of these businesses 
different valuation methods and assumptions can produce significantly different results that could affect the amount of any potential impairment charge that might be required to be recognized 
a charge of million resulting from the impairment of goodwill was recorded in in the health services segment 

table of contents income taxes our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and capital loss carryforwards 
we have gross deferred income tax assets of million at december  in assessing the realization of our deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and capital gains before our capital loss carryforwards expire 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance will be established against some or all of our deferred income tax assets 
this could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
a million valuation allowance has been provided on certain operating loss carryforwards at december  we reached this conclusion after considering the availability of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and the likelihood of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
differences between forecasted and actual future operating results could adversely impact our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets 
liabilities for insurance products the total balance of our liabilities for insurance products was billion at december  these liabilities are often payable over an extended period of time and the profitability of the related products is dependent on the pricing of the products and other factors 
differences between pricing assumptions and actual experience will impact future financial results 
we calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders based on actuarial and other assumptions 
these assumptions are generally best estimates  with moderate provision for adverse deviation 
many factors can affect the adequacy of these reserves and liabilities  such as economic and social conditions  inflation  changes in doctrines of legal liability and extra contractual damage awards 
therefore  the reserves and liabilities we establish are necessarily based on extensive estimates  assumptions and historical experience  all consistently applied 
establishing reserves is an uncertain process  and it is possible that actual claims will materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in determining our reserves and pricing our products 
if our assumptions with respect to future claims are incorrect  and our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses  we would be required to increase our liabilities  negatively affecting our operating results 
liabilities for loss contingencies related to legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
we recognize an estimated loss from these loss contingencies when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to legal proceedings 
the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position based on our current understanding of the relevant facts and laws 

table of contents results of operations by segment for the three years ended december  consolidated results and analysis dollars in thousands loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations net loss from continuing operations for was million compared to a loss of million for health services net loss for was million  compared to a loss of million for the loss included a goodwill impairment charge of million and net realized investment loss of million

table of contents general our financial services segment consists of revenues earned and expenses incurred from our insurance operations 
our primary products include deferred annuities  equity indexed annuities and single premium immediate annuities 
the profitability of this segment is primarily a function of net investment spread the difference between the investment income earned on our investments less the interest we credit to our policyholders  persistency of the in force business  mortality experience and management of our operating expenses 
deposits collected consist of deposits from our flexible premium deferred annuities  equity indexed annuities  single premium immediate annuities and other financial products that do not incorporate significant mortality features 
under gaap  these premium deposits are not shown as premium income in the statement of operations 
a change in premium deposits in a single period does not directly cause our operating income to change  although continued increases or decreases in premiums may affect the growth rate of assets on which investment spreads are earned

throughout our history  we have experienced periods of higher and lower benefit claims 
such volatility is not uncommon in the life insurance industry and  over extended periods of time  periods of higher claim experience tend to offset periods of lower claim experience 
during  benefits and claims decreased by million or  to million 
benefits and claims were lower in primarily due to favorable mortality experience for our in force life policies and lower premium levels

table of contents international operations discontinued operations our international operations discontinued operations were sold in the results included revenues earned and expenses incurred from abroad  primarily europe  and included fees collected on our deposits from unit linked assurance products

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity of standard management parent company we are a holding company whose capital requirements are met through payments received from our subsidiaries 
these payments have historically included surplus debenture interest  dividends  management fees  equipment rental fees  lease income and allocation of income taxes  all of which have been subject to restrictions under applicable insurance laws and are used to pay our operating expenses and meet our debt service obligations 
historically  the vast majority of our dividend income  management fee income  rental fee income and lease income have come from standard life  which accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues in if the proposed sale of standard life is consummated  we will no longer have this source of funds and will rely primarily on our health services operations 
in addition  we will no longer receive interest on the surplus debentures  which we intend to sell to capital assurance along with the stock of standard life 
however  if the sale of standard life is consummated  we will receive a substantial amount of cash proceeds as described below 
additionally  we have borrowed significant amounts from standard life to finance the operations of our health services business 
as of december   the aggregate amount of such borrowings was million 
as part of the purchase price for standard life  capital assurance would assume this indebtedness 
these internal sources of liquidity are supplemented by external sources such as revolving credit agreements and long term debt and equity financing in the capital markets 
we currently have million outstanding with our senior secured credit agreement with a bank 
there is currently no availability under this agreement 
if the proposed sale of standard life is consummated  we intend to repay this agreement in full 
potential cash available for historically  from a parent company perspective  available cash from our existing working capital and from the sources described above would be anticipated to be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for the following year 
however  while we expect that such sources will be sufficient to fund our operations until the completion of our pending sale of standard life  we expect to have available approximately million of net cash proceeds from that sale to fund our subsequent operations and our growth strategies for our us health services business 
should the cash proceeds from the sale of standard life be substantially reduced from our current expectation as may be the case as described in the following paragraph  we will need to obtain additional sources of funds in order to grow our health services business in accordance with our current plan 
there can be no assurances that such funding will be available under terms and conditions that are favorable to use  if at all 
in conjunction with our efforts to sell standard life  standard management also agreed to undertake a solicitation of the preferred security holders of sman capital trust i  a wholly owned subsidiary of standard management the trust at an estimated cost of approximately million to fund incentive payments in connection with obtaining the consent of the trust preferred holders 
if adopted  the amendment would provide us additional financing flexibility by allowing us to enter into certain business transactions  such as the sale of substantially all of our assets  without the acquirer of such assets being required to assume our responsibilities under the indenture 
in the event the requisite consents to amend the indenture are not received  standard management has the right to require capital assurance to assume standard management s obligations under the indenture 
if this event were to occur  the cash proceeds to be received by us in the sale would be reduced by the approximately million aggregate liquidation amount of trust preferred securities outstanding  which would reduce the net amount of cash expected to be available to us to operate and expand our health services business from approximately million to approximately million 
such an event would make it more likely that we would have to secure additional debt or equity financing to carry out our business plan  and there can be no assurance that we could obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all 
while we fully anticipate the sale of standard life to be consummated and for such sale to provide significant net cash proceeds to the company  the following paragraphs assume that such sale does not occur in order to describe our liquidity circumstances in that event as well as our circumstances up through the date of sale 
surplus debenture interest 
we loaned million to standard life pursuant to unsecured surplus debenture agreements surplus debentures  which requires standard life to make quarterly interest payments at a variable corporate base rate plus per annum  and annual principal payments of million per year beginning in and concluding in 
table of contents the interest and principal payments are subject to quarterly approval by the indiana department of insurance  depending upon satisfaction of certain financial tests relating to levels of standard life s capital and surplus and general approval of the commissioner of the indiana department of insurance commissioner 
for the quarters ended september  and december  the commissioner had not yet approved our request of 
million in aggregate interest payments 
assuming the approvals are granted and the december  interest rate of continues  we expect to receive interest income of million from the surplus debentures in  assuming a full year ownership of standard life 
dividends paid from standard life are limited by laws applicable to insurance companies 
as an indiana domiciled insurance company  standard life may pay a dividend or distribution from its surplus profits  without the prior approval of the commissioner  if the dividend or distribution  together with all other dividends and distributions paid within the preceding months  does not exceed the greater of net gain from operations or of surplus  in each case as shown in its preceding annual statutory financial statements 
in and  there were no dividends received from our subsidiaries 
in  we could receive dividends of million from standard life  without regulatory approval and an additional million with regulatory approval 
however  we do not expect to receive dividends from our subsidiaries in management fees 
pursuant to a management services agreement  standard life paid million during and for certain management services related to the production of business  investment of assets and evaluation of acquisitions 
in addition  dixie life paid standard life 
million and 
million in and  respectively  for certain management services provided 
both of these agreements provide that they may be modified or terminated by the applicable departments of insurance in the event of financial hardship of standard life or dixie life 
in  we expect to receive management fees of million from standard life  assuming a full year ownership of standard life 
equipment rental fees 
in  we received million from standard life for the use of our equipment and we expect to receive the same amount in  assuming a full year ownership of standard life 
lease income 
effective january   we entered into a lease agreement with standard life whereby standard life leases approximately  square feet of our corporate headquarters in indianapolis 
during  we received approximately 
million in lease income from standard life and we expect to receive the same amount in  assuming a full year ownership of standard life 
also associated with this lease  standard life is responsible for its share of building maintenance expenses 
during  we received 
million in maintenance expenses 
we expect to receive 
million in maintenance expense in  assuming a full year ownership of standard life 
anticipated sale of standard life 
based on management s expectations regarding the estimated adjusted purchase price for standard life  and assuming a final  post adjustment purchase price of million  we expect the net cash proceeds from the sale  before deducting transaction related fees and expenses  to be approximately million 
we intend to use such cash proceeds as follows approximately million for the repayment in full of a bank line of credit  approximately million to purchase certain assets from standard life at closing pursuant to the agreement  approximately million for professional fees investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and miscellaneous other expenses filing fees  printing and mailing proxy materials  prepayment penalties  severance payments  etc  approximately million to fund incentive payments in connection with obtaining the consent of the trust preferred holders  
million to reduce the principal amount outstanding under the mortgage on our home office  and the remaining approximately million as working capital to support and expand our health services business  including through selected strategic acquisitions 

table of contents in addition  we anticipate that standard life  after the sale  will still lease space from us for at least three years for  per year 
we also anticipate receiving  of annual dividends under the million of newly issued perpetual cumulative exchangeable preferred stock we expect to receive as partial consideration in our sale of standard life

subordinated debentures these securities represent an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of sman capital trust i  a delaware business trust organized to purchase our junior subordinated debentures and issue preferred securities 
the assets of the trust consist solely of the debentures which were purchased by the trust with the proceeds of the offering 
on august   the trust completed a public offering of million of its preferred securities 
the trust used the proceeds of this offering to purchase our junior subordinated debentures 
the following are characteristics of our trust preferred securities at december  outstanding balance of million  annual distribution rate of  distributions may be deferred up to consecutive quarters  matures august   may be redeemed on or after august  at per security plus accumulated and unpaid distributions  distributions required in based on current balances will be million  distributions are classified as interest expense 
the proceeds from the offering were immediately loaned to standard management by the trust in the form of an equal amount of subordinated debentures 
the debentures have similar terms as the preferred securities  including a interest rate 
although the trust is wholly owned by standard management  standard management does not consolidate the trust because all of the income and cash flows of the trust benefit the preferred security holders rather than standard management 
as such  the subordinated debentures and related interest expense are reflected in our consolidated results 
general 
on a consolidated basis  we reported net cash provided by operations of million and million for and  respectively 
although deposits received on our interest sensitive annuities and other financial products are not included in cash flow from operations under gaap  these funds  after returns to policyholders  are also available 
cash generated on a consolidated basis is available to the parent company only to the extent that it is generated at the holding company level or is available through interest  dividends  management fees or other payments from our subsidiaries 
at december   we had parent company only cash and short term investments of 
million 
these funds are available for general corporate purposes 
our parent company only operating expenses  not including interest expense  were million and million for and  respectively 
contractual obligations 
in our day to day business activities  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as operating leases and purchase orders 
maturities under these contracts  excluding policyholders contracts  are set forth in the following table as of december  in thousands and do not assume the sale of standard life and related transactions 
table of contents payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total payments include principal and interest off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements  other than the trust as discussed above 
liquidity of financial services the principal capital requirements of standard life are its contractual obligations to policyholders  surplus debenture interest  dividends  management fees and rental fees to standard management and operating expenses 
the primary source of funding for these obligations has been cash flow from premium income  net investment income  investment sales and maturities and sales of annuity products 
these sources of liquidity for standard life exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  policy withdrawals and surrenders 
the amount of withdrawals and surrenders is affected by a variety of factors such as renewal interest crediting rates  interest rates for competing products  general economic conditions  standard life s am best rating and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
in july  standard life received a rating from am best of b  or fair with a stable outlook  a one category reduction from its previous rating of b  or very good 
the policies and annuities issued by standard life contain provisions that allow certain policyholders to withdraw or surrender their policies under defined circumstances 
these policies and annuities generally contain provisions  which apply penalties or otherwise restrict the ability of policyholders to make such withdrawals or surrenders 
standard life closely monitors the surrender and policy loan activity of its insurance products and manages the composition of its investment portfolios  including liquidity  to ensure it has sufficient cash resources in light of such activity 
changes in interest rates may affect our incidence of policy surrenders and other withdrawals 
in addition to the potential effect on liquidity  unanticipated withdrawals in a changing interest rate environment could adversely affect our earnings if we were required to sell investments at reduced values to meet liquidity demands 
we manage our asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings effect of changing market interest rates 
we seek assets that have duration characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
we also prepare cash flow projections and perform cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy 
our insurance subsidiaries currently expect available liquidity sources and future cash flows to be adequate to meet the demand for funds 
statutory surplus is computed according to rules prescribed by the naic as modified by the indiana department of insurance  or the state in which our insurance subsidiaries do business 
statutory accounting rules are different from gaap and are intended to reflect a more conservative perspective 
with respect to new business  statutory accounting practices require that acquisition costs primarily commissions and policy issue costs and reserves for future guaranteed principal payments and interest in excess of statutory rates  be expensed in the year the new business is written 
these items cause a reduction in statutory surplus or surplus strain in the year written for many insurance products 
we design our products to minimize such first year losses  and in none of our products caused a statutory loss in the year written 
absent the sale of standard life  our long term growth goals contemplate continued growth in our insurance businesses 
to achieve these growth goals  our insurance subsidiaries will need to increase statutory surplus 
additional statutory surplus may be secured through various sources such as internally generated statutory earnings  infusions with funds generated through our debt or equity offerings  or mergers with other life insurance companies 
if additional capital is not available from one or more of these sources  we believe that we could reduce surplus strain through the use of reinsurance or through reduced writing of new business 

table of contents we believe that the operational cash flow of standard life will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for as of december   standard life had statutory capital and surplus for regulatory purposes of million 
as the annuity business produced by standard life increases  standard life expects to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements through statutory profits and through additional capital contributions by standard management 
net cash flow from operations on a statutory basis of standard life  after payment of benefits and operating expenses  was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to a decline in annuity premium deposits and an increase in surrenders 
if the need arises for cash  which is not readily available  additional liquidity could be obtained from the sale of invested assets 
liquidity of health services the principal capital requirements of our health services segment are its cost of goods sold  operating expenses  and future acquisitions 
the primary source of funding for these obligations has been cash flow from pharmaceutical sales  internal borrowings from standard management and external borrowings  and capital contributions from standard management 
the capital requirements of our health services segment have significantly exceeded revenues from pharmaceutical sales 
we believe that the operational cash flow of our health services segment will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated operational needs for therefore  this segment is expected to continue to fund its cash needs through the proceeds of the sale of standard life  external borrowings and capital contributions from standard management 
factors that may affect future results if the sale of standard life takes place  we will no longer derive revenues or cash flows from our financial services business and our future value will depend almost entirely on our health services business 
during and  the financial services segment of our business generated and  respectively  of our total revenues and generated positive cash flows from operations 
all such revenues and cash flows would cease upon closing of the sale of standard life 
following the proposed sale  our future prospects  and our value as an ongoing enterprise  will depend on the performance of our health services business  which is subject to the risks described below 
the possibility of a failure to complete the sale of standard life could have serious negative implications 
if the sale of standard life is not completed  we could be materially adversely affected 
we would be forced to determine whether to attempt to sell the financial services business again  continue to operate the financial services business or explore another strategic alternative 
if we try to sell the financial services business  we would need to expend significant time and resources that would otherwise be used to operate the health services business and we would likely have to sell the financial services business on terms that could be less favorable to us than the terms currently being offered by capital assurance 
in addition  if we were to engage in some form of alternative transaction  there could be no assurance that it would not be significantly dilutive to shareholders 
if we fail to obtain the necessary consents in the trust preferred consent solicitation and nevertheless elect to proceed with the proposed sale of standard life under the terms of the agreement  the net cash proceeds available for the operation and expansion of our health services business will be significantly reduced 
if we fail to receive sufficient consents for the amendment to the indenture in the trust preferred consent solicitation  we intend to nevertheless proceed with the proposed sale of standard life to capital assurance assuming all other conditions to such sale are satisfied by exercising our right to require capital assurance to assume our obligations under the indenture 
in such event  the cash proceeds to be received by us in the sale would be reduced by the approximately million aggregate liquidation amount of trust preferred securities outstanding 
as a result  our cash proceeds from the sale would reduce from approximately million to approximately million which  unless we adjust our expected use of such proceeds  would reduce the amount of cash available to operate and expand our health services business from approximately million to approximately million 
such an event would make it more likely that we would have to seek additional debt or equity financing to carry out our business plan  and there can be no assurance that we could obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all 

table of contents the price of our common stock has demonstrated increased volatility upon the announcement of a proposed sale of standard life and may continue to do so upon the consummation of the sale and could decline below recent levels 
in the event of a significant and sustained decline  our stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
our common stock has exhibited increased volatility upon the announcement of the sale of standard life and may continue to do so on the consummation of the sale of standard life 
depending upon investor acceptance of the proposed transaction  the price of the stock could decline below recent levels 
if such decline were severe and sustained  nasdaq could initiate action to delist our shares from the nasdaq national market  which could further negatively impact the price and or marketability of the shares 
risks related to our health services segment our health services subsidiary has not been profitable and we expect it to continue to incur substantial losses 
us health services and its subsidiaries have incurred substantial net losses since we have operated them 
us health services on a consolidated basis incurred a net loss of million and million  for and  respectively 
we expect net losses to continue until we generate significant revenues and achieve economies of scale in our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to successfully develop and market these products 
our future profitability will depend on several factors including our ability to access reasonably priced capital that will provide long term flexibility for the company  our ability to execute a planned strategy that will provide for cash flow from operations which will fund growth  and our ability to acquire appropriately priced and profitable businesses that provide cash flow and synergies to our current business 
we are subject to a number of factors affecting our business  including intense competition in the industry and the ability to attract and retain suppliers  clients and employees 
if we are unable to respond appropriately to any of these factors  business and financial results could suffer 
our operating results are affected by many factors  including competition  changes in the regulatory environment with respect to pharmacy service providers  relationships with suppliers of inventory  relationships with large institutional clients  general governmental regulation and general business conditions  many of which are outside our control 
our health services segment operates in a highly competitive environment and is in direct and indirect competition with a number of other companies that operate in the pharmaceutical market  including other retail  institutional and wholesale pharmacies  health insurers  health management organizations  pharmacy benefit managers and discount drug programs offered directly by pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in addition  the provision of drugs and pharmacy benefits is a highly dynamic and evolving business which is tied closely to changes in the medicare medicaid reimbursement environment  governmental entitlement program budget restrictions exercised at both the state and federal levels  cost controls imposed by third party payors in an attempt to exercise control over increasing health care costs  and increasing competition from pharmacies operating outside the united states which ship drugs to us residents over the internet and using other distribution channels 
there are currently a number of active initiatives being pursued by local and national legislatures 
on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  a comprehensive voluntary prescription drug benefit administered under medicare part d effective january  the new act also provides certain cost sharing government subsidies for individuals who might otherwise qualify for drug coverage under medicaid or similar government funded aid programs 
since a notable portion of our future institutional pharmacy business will be made available to medicare qualified patients who may qualify for this new benefit  it may have a substantial and lasting effect on the profitability of our business depending on how it and similar initiatives are administered by the government agencies charged with implementation 
since important elements of the new act relating to issues as formulary development  drug pricing and drug discount cards have yet to be finalized  it is impossible to predict the impact of the act on our profitability 

table of contents our profitability and ability to conduct business in the health services segment could be negatively impacted by a change in our relationships with our largest institutional clients 
a large portion of the present and future growth of our institutional pharmacy business is contingent upon our ability to acquire and retain long term contracts at favorable terms with institutional care facilities 
currently we have more than contractual relationships with institutional clients 
we are presently attempting to grow and diversify the number  type and terms of these contracts  but a number of factors including the ability to favorably compete with respect to pricing  our relationships with drug and supplement manufacturers and suppliers  and the economic solvency and profitability of our institutional clients can impact our profitability and opportunities for future growth 
in addition  although we believe our current relationship with our institutional clients is strong  the loss of key institutional clients would materially affect the operation of our health services segment 
because our health services business model is relatively new and unproven  our limited operating history in this segment is not indicative of future performance  and this part of our business is difficult to evaluate 
because we have only recently entered the health services segment  we do not have an operating history upon which an investor can evaluate our prospects 
in attempting to implement our business model  we may need to significantly change our business operations  sales and implementation practices  customer service and support operations and management focus 
we are also facing new risks and challenges  including a lack of meaningful historical financial data upon which to plan future budgets  the need to develop strategic relationships and other risks in this report 
continuing efforts to contain healthcare costs may reduce our future health services revenue 
the sales and profitability of the health services segment are affected by the efforts of healthcare payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare by lowering reimbursement rates  limiting the scope of covered services  and negotiating reduced or capitated pricing arrangements 
any changes which lower reimbursement levels under medicaid  medicare or private pay programs  including managed care contracts  could reduce our future revenue 
furthermore  other changes in these reimbursement programs or in related regulations could reduce its future revenue 
these changes may include modifications in the timing or processing of payments and other changes intended to limit or decrease the growth of medicaid  medicare or third party expenditures 
if we fail to comply with licensure requirements  fraud and abuse laws or other applicable laws  it may need to curtail operations  and could be subject to significant penalties 
our pharmacy business is subject to extensive and often changing federal  state and local regulations  and our pharmacy is required to be licensed in the states in which it is located or does business 
while we continuously monitor the effects of regulatory activity on its operations and believe we currently have all necessary pharmacy licenses  the failure to obtain or renew any required regulatory approvals or licenses could adversely affect the continued operation of the business 
the long term care facilities that contract for our services are also subject to federal  state and local regulations and are required to be licensed in the states in which they are located 
the failure by these long term care facilities to comply with these or future regulations or to obtain or renew any required licenses could result in our inability to provide pharmacy services to these facilities and their residents 
we are also subject to federal and state laws that prohibit some types of direct and indirect payments between healthcare providers 
these laws  commonly known as the fraud and abuse laws  prohibit payments intended to induce or encourage the referral of patients to  or the recommendation of  a particular provider of items or services 
violation of these laws can result in loss of licensure  civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from the medicaid  medicare and other federal healthcare programs 
if we or our client institutions fail to comply with medicaid and medicare reimbursement regulations  our health services revenue could be reduced  we could be subject to penalties and we could lose our eligibility to participate in these programs 
as of december   approximately of our health services pharmacy revenues were from government sponsored programs 
government sponsored programs include medicaid and  to a lesser extent  medicare 
our remaining billings are currently paid or reimbursed by individual residents  long term care facilities and other third party payors  
table of contents including private insurers 
a portion of these revenues are indirectly dependent on government programs 
we anticipate that as the institutional pharmacy portion of our health services segment grows  direct reimbursement from government sponsored programs will become a material portion of our pharmacy billings 
the medicaid and medicare programs are highly regulated 
the failure  even if inadvertent  of us and or our client institutions to comply with applicable reimbursement regulations could adversely affect our reimbursement under these programs and our ability to continue to participate in these programs 
in addition  our failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to other penalties 
changes in governmental regulation and legislation could have a substantial impact on our profitability 
our health services segment is subject to substantial regulation at both the state and federal levels 
our ability to continue operating as a retail  mail order and institutional pharmacy is contingent upon our ability to maintain appropriate licenses in all the states in which they currently conduct business 
we are also required to comply with a comprehensive set of regulations under the federal health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa with respect to the privacy and security of patient health information and the method in which this information is electronically transmitted to payors and governmental agencies such as the agencies responsible for implementing the medicare and medicaid programs 
regulations implementing hipaa are still being disseminated  revised and actively reviewed as of the time of this writing 
it is possible that substantial changes in these regulations  or in the strictness of interpretation of these regulations  may adversely affect our relationships with our clients and materially affect our future operations by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance 
as with the insurance laws  we cannot predict the impact of future state or federal laws or regulations on its health services business 
we are subject to various risks relating to our acquisition strategy 
one component of our growth strategy contemplates our making selected acquisitions that will help grow the health services segment 
recently  we terminated the agreements to acquire two separate organizations in the health services segment that would have significantly increased the size of this part of our business 
acquisitions involve inherent uncertainties 
these uncertainties include the effect on the acquired businesses of integration into a larger organization and the availability of management resources to oversee the operations of these businesses 
the successful integration of acquired businesses will require  among others consolidation of financial and managerial functions and elimination of operational redundancies  achievement of purchasing efficiencies  the addition and integration of key personnel  and the maintenance of existing business 
even though an acquired business may have experienced positive financial performance as an independent company prior to an acquisition  we cannot be sure that the business will continue to perform positively after an acquisition 
we also may acquire businesses with unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations 
we have policies and procedures to conduct reviews of potential acquisition candidates for compliance with healthcare laws and to conform the practices of acquired businesses to its standards and applicable laws 
we also generally seek indemnification from sellers covering these matters 
we may  however  incur material liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses 
we cannot be sure of the successful integration of any acquisition or that an acquisition will not have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we are likely to require additional funding  which may be difficult to obtain 
our health services business has had negative cash flows and net losses since its inception in we expect negative cash flows from operations to continue until we achieve substantial sales increases of our health services products 
the proceeds of the proposed sale of standard life  if consummated  would provide us with significant funding  but we would lose the positive cash flows generated by our financial services business 
even though we would receive significant cash proceeds from the sale  our health services business has significant cash needs  including in connection with making strategic acquisitions 
as a result  we will likely need to seek additional capital  which we may do through public or private equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents risks related to our financial services segment in the event that the sell of standard life is not consummated  and in any case  until such sale occurs  we are also subject to the following risks 
we are subject to a number of factors affecting our insurance business  including intense competition in the industry and the ability to attract and retain agents  suppliers  clients and employees 
if we are unable to respond appropriately to any of these factors  business and financial results could suffer 
our operating results are affected by many factors  including competition  lapse rates  interest rates  maintenance of insurance ratings  changes in the regulatory  general governmental regulation and general business conditions  many of which are outside our control 
our financial services division operates in a highly competitive environment and is in direct competition with a large number of insurance companies  many of which offer a greater number of products through a greater number of agents and have greater financial and other resources 
in addition  we may be subject  from time to time  to new competition resulting from additional insurance carriers introducing products similar to those offered by us 
moreover  as a result of recent federal legislation  commercial banks  insurance companies  and investment banks may now combine  provided certain requirements are satisfied  and we can expect to encounter increased competition from these providers of financial services 
this competitive environment could result in lower premiums  loss of sales and reduced profitability 
we believe that the ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  the ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market products and the ability to develop competitive products that also are profitable 
although management believes that good relationships with our independent general agents exist  competition for those agents among insurance companies is intense 
our independent general agents typically represent other insurance companies and may sell products that compete with its products 
sales of our annuity products and  therefore  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining independent agents and marketing organizations 
our financial results could suffer if our am best ratings are downgraded 
insurers compete with other insurance companies  financial intermediaries and other institutions on the basis of a number of factors  including the ratings assigned by am best 
am best assigns ratings labeled a through f superior  excellent  very good  fair  marginal  weak  poor  under regulatory supervision  and in liquidation 
standard life and dixie life both have a rating of b fair by am best 
am best s ratings represent their opinion based on a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative review of our financial strength  operating performance and market profile 
a rating of b is assigned by am best to companies that  in their opinion  have achieved good overall performance when compared to the standards established by am best 
according to am best  these companies generally have an adequate ability to meet their obligations to policyholders  but their financial strength is vulnerable to unfavorable changes in underwriting or economic conditions 
in evaluating a company s financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves  and the experience and competence of its management 
am best reviews its ratings of insurance companies from time to time 
if the am best ratings were downgraded  sales of annuity products could be significantly impacted and the financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
changes in governmental regulation and legislation could have a substantial impact on our profitability 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business 
changes in these regulations could have a significant impact on our profitability 
the primary purpose of these regulations is to protect policyholders  not investors 
these regulations are vested in governmental agencies having broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of our insurance business  including premium rates  policy forms and applications  marketing illustrations  dividend payments  capital adequacy and the amount and type of investments we may have 

table of contents the naic and state insurance regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance companies 
changes in the naic or state regulations  including  for example  changes in the risk based capital requirements  which are determined by the naic and state regulators  could affect the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us which could affect our ability to make payments upon our contractual obligations 
in addition  the federal government has become increasingly involved with insurance regulation in recent years  including the passage of the gramm leach bliley act  and more comprehensive federal legislation in this area is still being considered by congress 
federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas  including pension regulation  age and sex discrimination  financial services regulation and federal taxation  affect us specifically and the insurance business in general 
new state or federal laws or regulations  as well as a more strict interpretation of existing laws or regulations  may adversely affect our current claims exposure  adversely affect the profitability of our current and future products  and materially affect our future operations by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance 
we cannot predict the impact of future state or federal laws or regulations on our business 
see business of standard management regulatory factors 
under the internal revenue code of  as amended code  income tax payable by policyholders on investment earnings is deferred during the accumulation period of certain life insurance and annuity products 
the favorable tax treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over other non insurance products 
on may   president bush signed the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  which reduces the federal income tax rates applicable to certain dividends and capital gains realized by individuals 
this legislation may lessen the competitive advantage of certain of our products relative to other investments that generate dividend or capital gain income 
as a result  demand for certain of our products that offer income tax deferral may be negatively affected 
additionally  congress has from time to time considered other legislation that would reduce or eliminate the relative benefits to policy owners of the deferral of taxation on the accretion of value within certain insurance products or might otherwise affect the taxation of insurance products and insurance companies 
in particular  president bush recently proposed legislation  currently under consideration by congress  that would increase the amount that taxpayers may contribute each year to individual retirement accounts  which provide deferral benefits similar to those offered by our tax deferral products 
to the extent that the code is revised in accordance with these proposals or otherwise in a manner that reduces the tax deferred status of insurance products  or reduces the taxation of  or expands the market for  competing products  all life insurance companies  including us  could be adversely affected 
interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect spread income 
significant changes in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the credited interest rates paid on outstanding policies 
both rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect spread income 
although we develop and maintain asset liability management programs and procedures designed to preserve spread income in rising or falling interest rate environments  changes in interest rates could adversely affect these spreads 
our financial results are highly dependent on the financial condition of the companies in which we make investments and could suffer if the value of our investments decreases due to factors beyond our control 
our invested assets  approximately billion  represented approximately of our total assets at december  these investments are subject to customary risks of credit defaults and changes in market values 
in addition  the value of our investment portfolio depends in part on the financial condition of the companies in which we have made investments 
factors beyond our control  including interest rate levels  financial market performance  and general economic conditions may have a significant negative impact on our investment income and the value of our investment assets  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
our policy claims fluctuate from year to year  and future benefit payments may exceed our established reserves  which would cause our earnings to suffer 
our earnings are significantly dependent upon the extent to which the actual claims received by our subsidiaries is consistent with the actuarial assumptions we use in establishing reserves for the payment of benefit claims 
to the extent that the actual claims experience of our subsidiaries exceeds our established reserves  our operating income would be negatively affected  resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings 

table of contents volatility in benefit claims is common in the life insurance industry 
while our reserves have been sufficient to cover policy claims in the past and we attempt to limit the risk by carefully underwriting new policies and sharing risks with reinsurance companies  we may still experience a period of higher than anticipated benefit claims that exceeds our established reserves 
if this were to happen  it could result in increased operating losses 
because a significant portion of our annuity contracts are surrenderable  any substantial increase in the level of surrenders could negatively affect financial results 
as of december   approximately or billion of annuity contracts in force were surrenderable 
approximately of those contracts or approximately million of annuity contracts in force are surrenderable without charge 
changes in prevailing interest rates  ratings or other factors  which result in  or lead to significant levels of surrenders of existing annuity contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
surrenders result in a reduction of invested assets that earn investment income and a reduction of policyholder account balances that credit interest 
our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our assumptions regarding the value of intangible assets prove to be incorrect 
included in our financial statements are certain assets that are primarily valued  for financial statement purposes  on the basis of management s assumptions 
these assets include items such as deferred policy acquisition costs  present value of future profits  intangibles  goodwill  and organization and deferred debt issuance costs 
the assumptions are based upon  among others  interest rate spread and rates of mortality  surrender and lapse 
if  for instance  future mortality rates were higher than expected  projected margins would be lower and deferred policy acquisition cost amortization would increase 
the value of these assets reflected in our december  balance sheet totaled million  or of our assets 
although we have established procedures to periodically review the assumptions used to value these assets and determine the need to make adjustments  if our assumptions are incorrect and adjustments need to be made  our financial results could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to invest available funds in a manner that will maximize shareholder value and fund future obligations to policyholders and debtors  subject to appropriate risk considerations 
many of our products incorporate surrender charges  market interest rate adjustments or other features to encourage persistency 
approximately of the total insurance liabilities at december  had surrender penalties or other restrictions  approximately are not subject to surrender  and may be withdrawn without penalty 
we also seek to maximize the total return on our investments through active investment management 
accordingly  we have determined that the entire portfolio of fixed maturity securities is available to be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in relative values of individual securities and asset sectors  changes in prepayment risks  changes in credit quality outlook for certain securities  
table of contents liquidity needs  and other factors 
profitability of many of our products is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
although substantially all credited rates on annuity products may be changed annually subject to minimum guaranteed rates  changes in competition and other factors  including the impact of the level of surrenders and withdrawals  may limit the ability to adjust or to maintain crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions 
as of december   the average yield  computed on the cost basis of the investment portfolio  was  and the weighted average effective crediting rate was 
computer models were used to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from our existing business under various interest rate scenarios 
these simulations measured the potential gain or loss in fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
with such estimates  we seek to closely match the duration of assets to the duration of liabilities 
when the estimated duration of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is minimized because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
at december   the option adjusted duration of fixed maturity securities and short term investments were approximately  and the option adjusted duration of insurance liabilities was approximately the option adjusted duration compares the change in the value of an asset or liability with a change in interest rates 
this means in general that if interest rates increased basis points  the value of our asset portfolio would decrease by approximately 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points from their december  levels  our fixed maturity securities and short term investments net of the corresponding changes in the values of cost of policies purchased  cost of policies produced and insurance liabilities would decline in fair value by approximately million 
the calculations involved in our computer simulations incorporate numerous assumptions  require significant estimates and assume an immediate change in interest rates without any management of the investment portfolio in reaction to such change 
consequently  potential changes in the value of our financial instruments indicated by the simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios  and the differences may be material 
because our investments and liabilities are actively managed  actual losses could be less than those estimated above
