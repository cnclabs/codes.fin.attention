item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of and future outlook overview the following is a discussion of the segments in which we compete  the corporate strategy for the conduct of our business within these segments and significant events that have occurred during our company has two segments i a regulated natural gas distribution  transmission and storage segment  and ii a non regulated segment which participates in related ventures  consisting of natural gas marketing and production 
earnings from the regulated segment are primarily influenced by sales volumes  the rates we charge our customers and the expenses we incur 
in order for us to achieve our strategy of maintaining reasonable long term earnings  cash flow and stock value  we must successfully manage each of these factors 
sales volumes are temperature sensitive 
our regulated sales volumes in any period reflect the impact of weather  with colder temperatures generally resulting in increased sales volumes 
the impact of unusual winter temperatures on our revenues is reduced given our ability to adjust our winter rates for residential and small non residential customers in response to unusual winter temperatures 
the kentucky public service commission sets the rates we are permitted to charge our customers in the regulated segment 
we monitor our need to file requests with the kentucky public service commission for a general rate increase for our retail gas and transportation services 
through these general rate cases  we seek approval from the kentucky public service commission to adjust the rates we charge our customers 
the regulated segment s largest expense is gas supply  which we are permitted to pass through to our customers 
we control remaining expenses through budgeting  approval and review 
weather was warmer in than  resulting in decreased retail volumes 
rates charged our customers increased during to reflect implementation of new base rates effective october  these new base rates were approved by the kentucky public service commission in our general rate case filed during april rates charged our customers also increased to reflect increases in gas costs through the gas cost recovery clause and to reflect warmer winter weather through the weather normalization tariff 
gas supply expense increased in response to the increase in natural gas prices as determined in the unregulated national market 
our non regulated segment markets natural gas to large use customers both on and off delta s regulated system 
we endeavor to enter sales agreements when we can match estimated demand with a supply that provides an acceptable margin 
net income per share increased in primarily due to the implementation of new base rates in our regulated segment and increased margins in our non regulated segment 
our net income per share also includes a 
non recurring increase due to the recording of  mcf of unbilled sales at june  future outlook in and beyond  our success will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain a reasonable rate of return in our regulated segment 
we expect our non regulated segment to continue to contribute to consolidated net income in the extent of this contribution will be affected by fluctuations in natural gas prices 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash operating activities provide our primary source of cash 
cash provided by operating activities consists of net income adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation  depletion  amortization  deferred income taxes and changes in working capital 
our ability to maintain liquidity depends on our short term line of bank credit  shown as notes payable on the accompanying balance sheet 
notes payable increased to  at june   compared with  at june  this  increase reflects the fact that we generate internally only a portion of the cash necessary for our capital expenditure requirements 
we made capital expenditures of   and  during the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
we finance the balance of our capital expenditures on an interim basis through this short term line of bank credit 
we periodically repay our short term borrowings under our line of credit by using the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities 
long term debt decreased to  at june   compared with  at june  this  decrease resulted from provisions in the debentures allowing limited redemptions to be made to certain holders or their beneficiaries 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to  at june   compared with  at june  this  decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended june  is compared with the  decrease and  increase in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended june  and june   respectively  as shown in the following table provided by operating activities    used in investing activities    used in provided by financing activities   decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents   for the year ended june   cash provided by operating activities increased  as compared to due to favorable working capital fluctuations 
for the year ended june   cash provided by operating activities decreased  as compared to due to unfavorable working capital fluctuations  including increased cash needs for gas stored underground  gas accounts payable and deferred gas cost due to the increase in volumes stored and the increase of gas prices between periods 
changes in cash used in investing activities result primarily from changes in the level of capital expenditures between years 
for the year ended june   cash used in financing activities increased by  as compared to  primarily due to decreased net borrowings on the short term line of credit between years 
cash provided by financing activities increased  for the year ended june   primarily due to increased net borrowings on the short term line of credit compared to cash requirements our capital expenditures drive our continued need for capital 
we expect our capital expenditures for fiscal to be million  a million increase from fiscal capital expenditures 
the major reason for this increase is a mile transmission pipeline project  started in and to be completed in at an estimated total cost of million  that replaces an existing pipeline facility and also accesses additional gas production areas to enhance our transportation opportunities for the future 
the following is provided to summarize our contractual cash obligations for indicated periods after june  payments due by period after total interest payments a      long term debt b      operating leases c  pension contributions d      gas purchase obligations e     total contractual obligations      a our long term debt  notes payable and customers deposits all require interest payments 
interest payments are projected based on fiscal interest payments until the underlying debt matures 
we have assumed a year maturity for the notes payable 
b see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of this debt 
the cash obligations represent the maximum annual amount of redemptions to be made to certain holders or their beneficiaries through the debt maturity date 
c the operating lease amount after june  includes the present value of leases having an indeterminate life 
these leases relate primarily to storage well and compressor station site leases 
for the purpose of this calculation we have assumed a year life for these agreements  although we may cancel these leases at our option 
to the extent that these leases extend beyond  the annual lease payments will be  d for the purpose of this calculation  we have assumed a year life for the pension plan 
to the extent that the plan extends beyond  the annual contribution is estimated to be  e gas purchase obligations represent annual commitments with suppliers for periods extending up to four years 
these costs are recoverable in customer rates 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for other commitments and contingencies 
sufficiency of future cash flows to the extent that internally generated cash is not sufficient to satisfy operating and capital expenditure requirements and to pay dividends  we will rely on our short term line of credit 
our current available line of credit is  of which  was borrowed at june   classified as notes payable in the accompanying balance sheet 
the line of credit is with branch banking and trust company and extends through october  we expect that internally generated cash  coupled with short term borrowings  will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and normal capital expenditure requirements and to pay dividends for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
our ability to sustain acceptable earnings levels  finance capital expenditures and pay dividends is contingent on the adequate and timely adjustment of the regulated sales and transportation prices we charge our customers 
the kentucky public service commission sets these prices  and we continuously monitor our need to file rate requests with the kentucky public service commission for a general rate increase for our regulated services 
on april   delta filed a request for increased rates with the kentucky public service commission 
this general rate case case no 
requested an annual revenue increase of  an increase of 
the test year for the case was december  the public service commission approved new base rates effective october  the approved rates were based upon a return on equity of and provide for additional annual revenues of approximately  critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and at times difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
changes in these estimates  assumptions and judgments  in and of themselves  could materially impact our financial statements 
the following are the accounting estimates that we believe are the most critical in nature 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
regulatory accounting our accounting policies historically reflect the effects of the rate making process in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
our regulated segment continues to be cost of service rate regulated  and we believe the application of statement no 
to that segment continues to be appropriate 
we must reaffirm this conclusion at each balance sheet date 
if  as a result of a change in circumstances  it is determined that the regulated segment no longer meets the criteria of regulatory accounting under statement no 
 that segment will have to discontinue regulatory accounting and write off the respective regulatory assets and liabilities 
such a write off could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the application of statement no 
results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities 
regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
in some cases  we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the kentucky public service commission 
we must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery 
we base this conclusion on certain factors  including changes in the regulatory environment  recent rate orders issued by regulatory agencies and the status of any potential new legislation 
regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or for probable future refunds to customers 
we use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities  however  regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs  and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded 
pension our reported costs of providing pension benefits as described in note a of the notes to financial statements are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs associated with our defined benefit pension plan  for example  are impacted by employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may impact current and future pension costs 
pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations associated with the above factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but may be deferred and amortized in the future over the average remaining service period of active plan participants in accordance with statement for the years ended june   and  we recorded pension costs for our defined benefit pension plan of   and  respectively 
effective april   our board of directors adopted a plan amendment which enhanced the formula for benefits paid under the company s defined benefit retirement plan 
in september   our board of directors approved an amendment to the plan effective november  the plan amendment reduced the formula for benefits paid under the plan for future service and restricted participants from taking the benefits paid on service rendered subsequent to november  in the form of lump sum distributions from the plan 
our pension plan assets are principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments 
differences between actual portfolio returns and expected returns may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
in selecting our discount rate assumption we considered rates of return on high quality fixed income investments that are expected to be available through the maturity dates of the pension benefits 
our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is percent and is based on our targeted asset allocation assumption of approximately percent equity investments and approximately percent fixed income investments 
our approximately percent equity investment target includes allocations to domestic  international  and emerging markets managers 
our asset allocation is designed to achieve a moderate level of overall portfolio risk in keeping with our desired risk objective 
we regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation as appropriate 
we calculate the expected return on assets in our determination of pension cost based on the market value of assets at the measurement date 
using the market value recognizes investment gains or losses in the year in which they occur 
based on our assumed long term rate of return of percent  discount rate of percent  and various other assumptions  we estimate that our pension costs associated with our defined benefits pension plan will increase from  in to  in modifying the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets by 
percent would change pension costs for by approximately  modifying the discount rate assumption by 
percent would change pension costs by approximately  accumulated provisions for doubtful accounts we encounter risks associated with the collection of our accounts receivable 
as such  we record a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  we primarily utilize the historical accounts receivable write off amounts 
quarterly  at a minimum  we review the reserve for reasonableness based on the level of revenue and the aging of the receivable balance 
the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
the actual weather  commodity prices and other internal and external economic conditions  such as the mix of the customer base between residential  commercial and industrial  may vary significantly from our assumptions and may impact operating income 
unbilled revenues and gas costs at each month end  we estimate the gas service that has been rendered from the latest date of each cycle meter reading to the month end 
this estimate of unbilled usage is based on projected base load usage for each day unbilled plus projected weather sensitive usage for each degree day during the unbilled period 
unbilled revenues and gas costs are calculated from the estimate of unbilled usage multiplied by the rates in effect at month end 
actual usage patterns may vary from these assumptions and may impact operating income 
asset retirement obligations we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  during fiscal year and the primary impact was to change the method of accruing for gas well plugging and abandonment costs 
statement no 
requires that the fair value of our retirement obligations be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred 
statement no 
does not require the recognition of asset retirement obligations with indeterminate useful lives 
upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation  we increase the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value  through charges to depreciation  depletion and amortization  and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets 
we must use judgment to identify all appropriate asset retirement obligations 
the underlying assumptions used for the value of the retirement obligation and related capitalized costs can change from period to period 
these assumptions include the estimated future retirement costs  the estimated retirement date and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
new accounting pronouncements significant management judgment is generally required during the process of adopting new accounting pronouncements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these pronouncements 
factors that may affect future results management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the other sections of this report contain forward looking statements that are not statements of historical facts 
we have attempted to identify these statements by using words such as estimates  attempts  expects  foresees  monitors  plans  anticipates  intends  continues  believes  seeks  strives  will depend  and similar expressions 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements about o our operational plans and strategies  o the cost and availability of our natural gas supplies  o our capital expenditures  o sources and availability of funding for our operations and expansion  o our anticipated growth and growth opportunities through system expansion and acquisition  o competitive conditions that we face  o our production  storage  gathering and transportation activities  o regulatory and legislative matters  and o dividends factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward looking statements or historical results include the impact or outcome of o the ongoing restructuring of the natural gas industry and the outcome of the regulatory proceedings related to that restructuring  o the changing regulatory environment  generally  o a change in the rights under present regulatory rules to recover for costs of gas supply  other expenses and investments in capital assets  o changes in our capital expenditure requirements  o changes in economic conditions  demographic patterns and weather conditions in our retail service areas  o changes affecting our cost of providing gas service  including changes in gas supply costs  cost and availability of interstate pipeline capacity  interest rates  the availability of external sources of financing for our operations  tax laws  environmental laws and the general rate of inflation  o changes affecting the cost of competing energy alternatives and competing gas distributors  and o changes in accounting principles and tax laws or the application of such principles and laws to us 
results of operations gross margins our regulated and non regulated revenues  other than transportation  have offsetting gas expenses 
thus  gross margins represent operating revenues less purchased gas expense 
natural gas prices are determined by an unregulated national market 
therefore  the price that we pay for natural gas fluctuates with national supply and demand 
see item a for the impact of forward contracts 
the variation amounts and percentages presented in the following tables for regulated and non regulated gross margins include intersegment transactions 
these intersegment revenues and expenses  whose variations are also disclosed in the following tables  are eliminated in the consolidated statements of income 
in the following table we set forth variations in our gross margins for the last two fiscal years compared with the same periods in the preceding year compared compared to to increase decrease in our regulated gross margins gas rates  gas volumes   weather normalization adjustment non recurring unbilled gross margin on system transportation off system transportation other intersegment elimination increase decrease in our non regulated gross revenues gas rates  gas volumes transportation expenses other intersegment elimination increase decrease in consolidated gross margins  percentage increase decrease in our regulated volumes gas sales on system transportation off system transportation

heating degree days billed were of normal thirty year average temperatures for fiscal  as compared with of normal temperatures for and of normal for a heating degree day results from a day during which the average of the high and low temperature is one degree less than degrees fahrenheit 
the increase in gross margins for of  was due primarily to a  increase in gas rates 
regulated gas rates increased due to the implementation of increased regulated base rates effective october  as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
non regulated gas rates increased to reflect increases in the market price of natural gas 
due to recording unbilled regulated margins on  mcf of unbilled regulated volumes as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements   of the increase is non recurring 
we began recording these unbilled regulated margins in connection with receiving our rate order approving new base rates effective during october in addition  the weather normalization adjustment increased gross margins  as the result of warmer weather in the period 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in regulated gas sales volumes due to warmer weather in the period  which resulted in a  decrease in gross margins 
the decrease in gross margins for of  was due primarily to a decrease in regulated gas sales volumes as the result of warmer weather in the period offset by the weather normalization adjustment which increased gross margins  as the result of warmer weather in the period and a increase in off system transportation volumes 
a decline in gas rates in the non regulated segment was offset by the percentage increase in non regulated sales volumes 
operation and maintenance the  increase in operation and maintenance expenses for is primarily due to a  increase in compensation expense resulting from increasing base salary and bonus amounts and a  increase in employee medical expenses 
to a lesser extent  the company also experienced increases in insurance expense  directors fees and uncollectible account expense 
income taxes the increase in income taxes for is attributable to the increase in net income before income tax expense 
the increase in net income before income tax expense is largely attributable to the increase in operating income before income tax expense  which increased over the prior year 
basic and diluted earnings per common share for the fiscal years ended june   and  our basic earnings per common share changed as a result of changes in net income and an increase in the number of our common shares outstanding 
we increased our number of common shares outstanding as a result of shares issued through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan and our may  common stock offering of  shares 
we have no potentially dilutive securities 
as a result  our basic earnings per common share and our diluted earnings per common share are the same 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we purchase our gas supply through a combination of spot market gas purchases and forward gas purchases 
the price of spot market gas is based on the market price at the time of delivery 
the price we pay for our natural gas supply acquired under our forward gas purchase contracts  however  is fixed prior to the delivery of the gas 
additionally  we inject some of our gas purchases into gas storage facilities in the non heating months and withdraw this gas from storage for delivery to customers during the heating season 
we have minimal price risk resulting from these forward gas purchase and storage arrangements  because we are permitted to pass these gas costs on to our regulated customers through the gas cost recovery rate mechanism 
price risk for the non regulated business is mitigated by efforts to balance supply and demand 
however  there are greater risks in the non regulated segment because of the practical limitations on the ability to perfectly predict demand 
in addition  we are exposed to price risk resulting from changes in the market price of gas on uncommitted gas volumes of our non regulated companies 
none of our gas contracts are accounted for using the fair value method of accounting 
while some of our gas purchase contracts and gas sales contracts meet the definition of a derivative  we have designated these contracts as normal purchases and normal sales under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates on our variable rate notes payable 
the interest rate on our current short term line of credit with branch banking and trust company is benchmarked to the monthly london interbank offered rate 
the balance on our short term line of credit was  and  on june  and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate on our short term line of credit was and as of june  and  respectively 
based on the amount of our outstanding short term line of credit on june  and  a one percent one hundred basis point increase in our average interest rate would result in a decrease in our annual pre tax net income of  and  respectively
