item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation included in management s discussion and analysis are the following sections overview of acquisitions in critical accounting policies results of operations and outlook for and beyond liquidity and capital resources commitments and off balance sheet arrangements other matters new accounting pronouncements risk factors in the discussions that follow  we will focus on two measures that we use to manage the business and to review the results of our operations 
those two measures are segment margin and available cash 
our profitability depends to a significant extent upon our ability to maximize segment margin 
segment margin is calculated as revenues less cost of sales and operating expense  and does not include depreciation and amortization 
a reconciliation of segment margin to income from continuing operations is included in our segment disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
available cash is a non gaap liquidity measure calculated as net income with several adjustments  the most significant of which are the elimination of gains and losses on asset sales  except those from the sale of surplus assets  the addition of non cash expenses such as depreciation  and the subtraction of maintenance capital expenditures  which are expenditures to sustain existing cash flows but not to provide new sources of revenues 
for additional information on available cash and a reconciliation of this measure to cash flows from operations  see liquidity and capital resources non gaap financial measure below 
overview of genesis energy  lp is a delaware limited partnership that is publicly traded on the american stock exchange 
we operate through genesis crude oil  lp  and its subsidiary partnerships  genesis pipeline texas  lp  genesis pipeline  usa  lp  genesis co pipeline  lp and genesis natural gas pipeline  lp our operations are managed through our general partner  genesis energy  inc  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of denbury resources inc 
the general partner holds a general partner interest and a limited partner interest and public unitholders hold an aggregate limited partner interest in genesis energy  lp we operate in three business segments crude oil gathering and marketing  pipeline transportation and co marketing 
we generate revenues by selling crude oil and co and by charging fees for the transportation of crude oil  natural gas and co on our pipelines 
our focus is on the margin we earn on these revenues  which is calculated by subtracting the costs of the crude oil  the costs of transporting the crude oil  natural gas and co to the customer  and the costs of operating our assets 
our primary goal is to generate available cash for our unitholders 
this available cash is then distributed quarterly to our unitholders 
during  we generated available cash before reserves that exceeded the amount we distributed by more than ten percent 
in  we improved our ability to meet this goal by expanding our credit facility to include an acquisition component  purchasing a co volumetric production payment and related marketing contracts  and building three new pipeline segments for crude oil and co transportation 
additionally  in  we have entered into two transactions to acquire assets to increase available cash for distribution to our unitholders 
in june  we replaced our existing bank credit facility with a group of banks led by bank of america as agent with a million senior secured bank credit facility the credit agreement 
the credit agreement consists of a million revolving line of credit for acquisitions and a million working capital revolving credit facility 
during the third quarter of  we acquired a bcf volumetric production payment and related industrial sales contracts from denbury for million  further expanding our co marketing business 
our continuing gathering and marketing segment did not perform as well as expected in volatility in p plus market prices for crude oil continued to create fluctuations in our crude oil gathering and marketing segment margin 
higher field costs due to increased fuel prices and increases in payroll and fleet repair costs also contributed to reduce our margin in this segment 
our pipeline transportation segment showed improvement in revenues from our pipeline transportation operations increased primarily due to tariff increases and the sale of crude oil volumes deducted from shippers as pipeline loss allowances that exceeded actual losses 
the high crude oil prices in increased our segment margin from these sales 
during  we incurred expenses totaling million for professional services to assist us in the internal control documentation and assessment provisions of the sarbanes oxley act including additional audit fees related to this process 
acquisitions in gas gathering and marketing assets in january  we acquired fourteen natural gas pipeline and gathering systems located in texas  louisiana and oklahoma from multifuels energy asset group  lp for million 
these fourteen systems total to miles of pipeline and related assets 
this acquisition was financed through our credit agreement 
this acquisition will enable us to complement our existing operations enabling us to provide gas gathering and marketing services in areas where we have existing operations and relationships with oil and gas producers 
syngas investment on february  we entered into a definitive agreement with tchi inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of chevrontexaco global energy inc  to purchase its partnership interest in t p syngas supply company t p syngas for million  subject to normal closing conditions 
the acquisition is subject to a right of first refusal held by praxair hydrogen supply  inc praxair  which holds the other interest in the partnership 
praxair must exercise the right of first refusal within days of february  t p syngas is a partnership that owns a syngas manufacturing facility located in texas city  texas 
this facility processes natural gas to produce syngas a combination of carbon monoxide and hydrogen and high pressure steam 
all of the syngas and steam produced by the facility is sold to praxair under a long term processing agreement 
the acquisition  if concluded  will be financed through our credit agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note summary of significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial results and positions 
these policies require management s judgment and often employ the use of information that is inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue and expense accruals  pipeline loss allowance recognition  depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets and contingent and environmental liabilities 
we discuss these policies below 
revenue and expense accruals information needed to record our revenues is generally available to allow us to record substantially all of our revenue generating transactions based on actual information 
the accruals that we are required to make for revenues are generally insignificant 
we routinely make accruals for expenses due to the timing of receiving third party information and reconciling that information to our records 
these accruals can include some crude oil purchase costs and expenses for operating our assets such as contractor charges for goods and services provided 
for crude oil purchases transported on our trucks or our pipelines  we have access to the volumetric and pricing data so that we can record these transactions based on actual information 
accounting for crude oil purchases that involve third party transportation services sometimes require us to make estimates  as the necessary volumetric data is not available within the timeframe needed 
by balancing our crude oil purchase and sales volumes with the change in our inventory positions  we believe we can make reasonable estimates of the unavailable data 
the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  require that estimates be made of the effectiveness of derivatives as hedges and the fair value of derivatives 
the actual results of the transactions involving the derivative instruments will most likely differ from the estimates 
we make very limited use of derivative instruments  however  when we do  we base these estimates on information obtained from third parties and from our own internal records 
we believe our estimates for revenue and expense items are reasonable  but there can be no assurance that actual amounts will not vary from estimated amounts 
pipeline loss allowance recognition numerous factors can cause crude oil volumes to expand and contract 
these factors include temperature of both the crude oil and the surrounding atmosphere and the quality of the crude oil  in addition to inherent imprecision of measurement equipment 
as a result of these factors  crude oil volumes fluctuate  which can result in losses in volumes of crude oil in the custody of the pipeline that belongs to the shippers 
in order to compensate the pipeline for bearing the risk of actual losses in volumes that occur  the pipeline generally has established in its tariffs the right to make volumetric deductions from the shippers for quality and volumetric fluctuations 
we refer to these deductions as pipeline loss allowances 
we compare these allowances to the actual volumetric gains and losses of the pipeline and the net gain or loss is recorded as revenue or expense  based on prevailing market prices at that time 
when net gains occur  the pipeline company has crude oil inventory 
when net losses occur  we reduce any recorded inventory on hand and record a liability for the purchase of crude oil that we must make to replace the lost volumes 
we reflect inventories in the financial statements at the lower of the recorded value or the market value at the balance sheet date 
we value liabilities to replace crude oil at current market prices 
the crude oil in inventory can then be sold  resulting in additional revenue if the sales price exceeds the inventory value 
we cannot predict future pipeline loss allowance revenue because these revenues depend on factors beyond management s control such as the crude oil quality and temperatures  as well as crude oil market prices 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets in order to calculate depreciation and amortization we must estimate the useful lives of our fixed assets at the time the assets are placed in service 
we base our calculation of the useful life of an asset on our experience with similar assets 
experience  however  can cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we review our assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we compare the carrying value of the fixed asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from that asset 
estimates of future net cash flows include estimating future volumes  future margins or tariff rates  future operating costs and other estimates and assumptions consistent with our business plans 
should the undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying value  we record an impairment charge to reflect the asset at fair value 
liability and contingency accruals we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities including environmental remediation and potential legal claims 
when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  we make accruals 
we base our estimates on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome  including consultation with external experts and counsel 
we revise these estimates as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved 
in  we recorded an estimate of million for the potential liability for fines related to the crude oil spill in december from our mississippi pipeline system 
after assessing information obtained in meetings with the government  we increased this estimate to a total of million in we paid fines totaling million in we also make estimates related to future payments for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations 
environmental costs include costs for studies and testing as well as remediation and restoration 
we sometimes make these estimates with the assistance of third parties involved in monitoring the remediation effort 
we have recorded an estimate for the additional costs expected to be incurred to complete the remediation of the site of the mississippi crude oil pipeline spill 
we based this estimate upon expectations of the additional work to be performed to meet regulatory requirements and restore the site 
because the costs of remediation and restoration for this spill are covered by insurance  we recorded a receivable from the insurers for a similar amount 
we believe our estimates for contingent liabilities are reasonable  but we cannot assure you that actual amounts will not vary from estimated amounts 
results of operations and outlook for and beyond crude oil gathering and marketing operations the key factors affecting our crude oil gathering and marketing segment margin include production volumes  volatility of p plus  volatility of grade differentials  inventory management  field operating costs and credit costs 
segment margins from gathering and marketing operations are a function of volumes purchased and the difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  minus the associated costs of aggregation and transportation 
the absolute price levels for crude oil do not necessarily bear a relationship to segment margin as absolute price levels normally impact revenues and costs of sales by equivalent amounts 
because period to period variations in revenues and costs of sales are not generally meaningful in analyzing the variation in segment margin for gathering and marketing operations  these changes are not addressed in the following discussion 
in our gathering and marketing business  we seek to purchase and sell crude oil at points along the distribution chain where we can achieve positive margins 
we generally purchase crude oil at prevailing prices from producers at the wellhead under short term contracts 
we then transport the crude along the distribution chain for sale to or exchange with customers 
additionally  we generally enter into exchange transactions with third parties when the cost of the exchange is less than the alternate cost we would incur in transporting or storing the crude oil 
in addition  we often exchange one grade of crude oil for another to maximize margins or meet contract delivery requirements 
prior to the first quarter of  we purchased crude oil in bulk at major pipeline terminal points 
these bulk and exchange transactions were characterized by large volumes and narrow profit margins on purchases and sales 
generally  as we purchase crude oil  we simultaneously establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases  on the one hand  and sales or future delivery obligations  on the other hand 
we do not hold crude oil  futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes 
a significant factor affecting our gathering and marketing segment margins is the change in domestic production of crude oil 
short term and long term price trends impact the amount of capital that oil producers have available to maintain existing production and to invest in developing crude reserves  which in turn impacts the amount of crude oil that is available to be gathered and marketed by us and our competitors 
during the last three years  posted prices for west texas intermediate crude oil have ranged from a low near per barrel to a high of almost per barrel 
the volatility in prices over the last three years makes it very difficult to estimate the volume of crude oil available to purchase 
we expect to continue to be subject to volatility and long term declines in the availability of crude oil production for purchase 
crude oil prices in the united states are impacted by both international factors as well as domestic factors 
international factors such as wars and conflicts  instability of foreign governments  and labor strikes affect prices  as do the influences in the us of environmental regulations and the supply of domestic production 
an increase in the market price of crude oil does not impact us to the extent many people expect 
when market prices for oil increase  we must pay more for crude oil  but we normally are able to sell it for more 
most of our contracts for the purchase and sale of crude oil have components in the pricing provisions such that the price paid or received is adjusted for changes in the market price for crude oil 
the pricing in the majority of our purchase contracts contain the market price component  a bonus that is not fixed  but instead is based on another market factor and a deduction to cover the cost of transporting the crude oil and to provide us with a margin 
this floating bonus is usually the price quoted by platt s for wti p plus 
typically the pricing in a contract to sell crude oil will consist of the market price component and p plus 
the margin on individual transactions is then dependent on our ability to manage our transportation costs 
the pricing in some contracts to purchase crude oil will consist of the market price component and a bonus  which is generally a fixed amount ranging from a few cents to several dollars 
when the bonus for purchases of crude oil is fixed and p plus floats in the sales contracts  the margin on individual transactions can vary from month to month depending on changes in the p plus component as well as our management of transportation costs 
p plus does not consistently move in correlation with the price of crude oil in the market 
p plus is affected by numerous factors such as future expectations for changes in crude oil prices that can cause the variance from current changes in crude oil prices 
a few of our purchase contracts and some sale contracts also include a component for grade differentials 
the grade refers to the type of crude oil 
crude oil from different wells and areas can have different chemical compositions 
these different grades of crude oil will appeal to different customers depending on the processing capabilities of the refineries that ultimately process the crude oil 
we may buy crude oil under a contract where we considered the typical grade differences in the market when we set the fixed bonus 
if we then sell the oil under a contract with a floating grade differential in the formula  and that grade differential fluctuates  then we can experience an increase or decrease in our margin from that oil purchase and sale 
this volatility in grade differentials can affect the volatility of our gathering and marketing segment margin 
our purchase and sales contracts are primarily evergreen contracts  which means they continue from month to month unless one of the parties to the contract gives days notice of cancellation 
in order to change the pricing in a fixed bonus contract  we would have to give days notice that we want to cancel or renegotiate the contract 
as a result  this time requirement for notice  means that at least a month will pass before the fixed bonus can be reduced to correspond with a decrease in the p plus component of the related sales contract 
in this case  our margin would be reduced until such a change is made 
because of the volatility of p plus  it is not practical to renegotiate every purchase contract for every change in p plus 
accordingly  segment margins from the sale of the crude oil may be volatile as a result of these timing differences 
another factor that can contribute to volatility in our earnings is inventory management 
generally contracts for the purchase of crude oil will state that we will buy all of the production for the month from a particular well 
we generally aggregate the volumes purchased from numerous wells and deliver the crude oil into a pipeline where we sell the crude oil to a third party 
while oil producers can make estimates of the volume of oil that their wells will produce in a month  they cannot state absolutely how much oil will be produced 
in some cases  our sales contracts state a specific volume to be sold 
consequently  if a well produces more than expected  we will purchase volumes in a month that we have not contracted to sell 
we hold these volumes as inventory and sell them in a later month 
if the market price of crude oil declines below its cost while we have these inventory volumes  then we recognize a loss in our financial statements 
if the market price rises  then we realize a gain when we sell the unexpected volume of inventory in a later month at higher prices 
during  we changed many of our sales contract arrangements so that volumes sold are the same as the volumes purchased in an effort to limit our exposure to these price fluctuations by minimizing inventory builds and draws 
field operating costs primarily consist of the costs to operate our fleet of trucks leased and owned used to transport crude oil  and the costs to maintain the trucks and assets used in the crude oil gathering operation 
approximately of these costs are variable and increase or decrease with volumetric changes 
these costs include payroll and benefits as drivers are paid on a commission basis based on volumes  maintenance costs for the trucks as we lease the trucks under full service maintenance contracts under which we pay a maintenance fee per mile driven  and fuel costs 
fuel costs also fluctuate based on changes in the market price of diesel fuel 
fixed costs include the base lease payment for the vehicle  insurance costs and costs for environmental and safety related operations 
operating results from continuing operations for our crude oil gathering and marketing segment were as follows 
years ended december  in thousands revenues    crude oil costs    field operating costs    change in fair value of derivatives  segment margin    volumes per day from continuing operations crude oil wellhead barrels    crude oil total barrels    year ended december  as compared to year ended december  gathering and marketing segment margins decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  contributing to this reduction in segment margin were two primary factors as follows a million decrease in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale 
the decrease on the margin between the sales and purchase prices of the crude oil is attributable primarily to increases in p plus in the first half of that we benefited from significantly 
in response to the decline in p plus during the latter half of  we changed many of our fixed bonus contracts to fluctuating bonuses based on p plus  and as a result  we did not experience the same increases in margin when p plus increased in a million increase in field operating costs  from increased fuel costs to operate our tractor trailers  additional employee compensation and benefit costs due to additional volumes  and higher insurance costs and higher vehicle maintenance costs 
although we reduced operations in from levels with the sale of a large part of our texas operations  our insurance  safety and other fixed costs did not decline proportionately 
competitive pressures made it difficult to reduce crude oil purchase prices to offset the increases in field operating costs 
partially offsetting these decreases was a increase in daily wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in a million increase in segment margin 
additionally credit costs declined by million as we reduced the number of letters of credit we issued 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  gathering and marketing segment margins decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  a percent decrease in wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in a million decrease in segment margin  was the primary reason for this decrease 
factors offsetting this decrease were a million increase in segment margin due to an increase in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale 
although p plus declined significantly in the latter half of  the average for of per barrel was higher than the average for of per barrel 
this price increase was not enough however to offset the decline in volumes  and a million decrease in field operating costs  primarily from a million decrease in payroll and benefits  offset by a million increase in repair costs 
the decreased payroll related costs can be attributed to an approximate percent decrease in the wellhead volumes 
the increase in repair costs is attributable primarily to repairs at truck unloading stations 
a million change in the fair value of our net asset for derivatives 
as a result of the significant reduction in our bulk and exchange activities at december   and a review of contracts existing at december   we determined that substantially all of our contracts did not meet the requirement for treatment as derivative contracts under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted 
the contracts were designated as normal purchases and sales under the provisions for that treatment in sfas no 
as a result  the fair value of the partnership s net asset for derivatives decreased in we changed our business model in to substantially eliminate our bulk and exchange activity due to the relatively low margins and high credit requirements for these transactions 
additionally  we reviewed our wellhead purchase contracts to determine whether margins under those contracts would support higher credit costs 
in some cases  we cancelled contracts 
these volume reductions began in late and continued into the first half of volumes beginning in the third quarter of remained relatively stable at an average of  to  barrels per day 
outlook for and beyond based on past experience and knowledge of the crude oil gathering and marketing segment  we continue to expect volatility from this segment 
we continue to take steps to improve the performance of this segment 
these steps include effectively managing relationships with suppliers  inventory management  controlling field costs  and improving operational efficiency in the field 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to dispose of or to make further investments in components of this segment in order to improve its performance 
pipeline operations we operate three common carrier crude oil pipeline systems in a five state area 
we refer to these pipelines as our texas system  mississippi system and jay system 
volumes shipped on these systems for the last three years are as follows barrels per day pipeline system texas    mississippi    jay    in  we sold or abandoned significant portions of our texas system 
the segments we retained and continue to operate are from west columbia to webster  from webster to texas city  and from webster to a shipper s facility in houston 
information on the segments sold or abandoned is discussed in the section discontinued operations below 
the following information pertains only to continuing operations 
volumes on our texas system averaged  barrels per day during the crude oil that enters our system comes to us at west columbia where we have a connection to teppco s south texas system and at webster where we have connections to two other pipelines 
one of these connections at webster is with exxonmobil pipeline and is used to receive volumes that originate from teppco s pipelines 
under the terms of our sale of portions of the texas system to teppco  we had a joint tariff with teppco through october under which we earned per barrel on the majority of the barrels we deliver to the shipper s facilities 
this tariff declined to per barrel in november most of the volume being shipped on our texas system goes to two refineries on the texas gulf coast 
the mississippi system begins in soso  mississippi and extends to liberty  mississippi 
at liberty  shippers can transfer the crude oil to a connection to capline  a pipeline system that moves crude oil from the gulf coast to refineries in the midwest 
the system has been improved to handle the increased volumes produced by denbury and transported on the pipeline 
in order to handle future increases in production volumes in the area that are expected  we have made capital expenditures for tank  station and pipeline improvements and we intend to make further improvements 
see capital expenditures under liquidity and capital resources below 
beginning in september  denbury became a shipper on the mississippi system  under an incentive tariff  designed to encourage shippers to increase volumes shipped on the pipeline 
prior to this point  denbury sold its production to us before it entered the pipeline 
the second segment of the pipeline from liberty to near baton rouge  louisiana has been out of service since february  a connecting carrier tested its pipeline and decided not to reactivate its pipeline 
during the second quarter of we displaced the crude oil in this segment with inhibited water 
in and  this segment made no contribution to pipeline revenues 
in the third quarter of  we wrote this segment down to its estimated salvage value  recording an impairment charge of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we constructed two segments of crude oil pipeline to connect producing fields operated by denbury to our mississippi system 
one of these segments was placed in service in and the other will begin operation in the first quarter of denbury will pay us a minimum payment each month for the right to use these pipeline segments 
we account for these arrangements as direct financing leases 
the jay pipeline system in florida alabama ships crude oil from fields with relatively short remaining production lives 
volumes have declined from an annual average of  in to  in and to  barrels per day in  although the decline in can be attributed to hurricane ivan that hit the panhandle of florida in mid september 
while our facilities experienced minimal damage from the storm  power outages in the area shut down our crude oil pipeline transportation operations through the end of september 
if volumes in september and october had been the same as in the last two months of  the overall volume for would have been the same as in many of the costs to operate our pipeline are fixed costs  including the costs of compliance with environmental regulations and the costs of insurance  so the decline in volumes has necessitated increases in tariffs 
the only shipper on the largest portion of the pipeline agreed to tariff rate increases in and that have helped offset the declines in the volumes and increased costs of operating this pipeline 
increases in crude oil prices in resulted in greater profit from the sale of pipeline loss allowance volumes 
historically  the largest operating costs in our crude oil pipeline segment have consisted of personnel costs  power costs  maintenance costs and costs of compliance with regulations 
some of these costs are not predictable  such as failures of equipment  or are not within our control  like power cost increases 
we perform regular maintenance on our assets to keep them in good operational condition and to minimize cost increases 
in the fourth quarter of we constructed a co pipeline in mississippi to transport co from denbury s main co pipeline to an oil field to which we also constructed an oil pipeline to bring the oil from the field to our existing mississippi pipeline 
denbury has the exclusive right to use this co pipeline 
this arrangement has been accounted for as a direct financing lease 
operating results from continuing operations for our pipeline transportation segment were as follows 
years ended december  in thousands revenues  including revenues from direct financing leases    pipeline operating costs    segment margin    volumes per day from continuing operations crude oil pipeline barrels    year ended december  compared with year ended december  pipeline segment margin increased million to million for  as compared to million for the increase in pipeline segment margin is attributable to the following factors a million increase in pipeline revenues from volumetric gain barrels due to higher sales prices for crude oil  a million increase in tariff revenues due to higher average tariff rates partially offset by lower volumes  and a million decrease in pipeline operating costs 
in  we recorded a charge of million for an accrual for the removal of an abandoned offshore pipeline 
in  we received permission to abandon the pipeline in place 
as a result we reversed million of the amounts previously accrued 
the charges and reversal resulted in a change of million in pipeline operating costs between the periods 
additionally  repairs  right of way maintenance and regulatory testing and compliance expenses in the period were million less than in changes in other operating costs resulted in another million of decreased costs 
the co pipeline  which was operational for one month in  contributed approximately  of the segment margin in year ended december  compared with year ended december  pipeline segment margin decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the factors decreasing pipeline segment margin were a seven percent decrease in throughput between the two years  resulting in a revenue decrease of million  and a million increase in pipeline operating costs in in the third quarter we recorded an asset retirement obligation of million related to an offshore pipeline 
pipeline operating costs increased million for personnel and benefits costs related to additions of operations and engineering staff  and million for costs associated with work vehicles for the new staff 
costs associated with maintenance of right of ways and costs for testing under pipeline integrity regulations increased a combined million 
in  we increased safety training for pipeline operations personnel at a cost of million 
insurance costs increased million due to the combination of insurance market conditions and our loss history 
other operating costs  including power costs increased a total of million 
partially offsetting these decreases were the following factors a percent increase in the average tariff on shipments resulting in a million increase in revenue  and a million increase in revenues from sales of pipeline loss allowance barrels primarily as a result of higher crude oil market prices resulting in more revenue on these volumes 
outlook for and beyond volumes on the texas system declined in from levels 
we anticipate that volumes on the texas system may continue to decline as refiners on the texas gulf coast compete for crude oil with other markets connected to teppco s pipeline systems 
in november  our share of the joint tariff with teppco and exxonmobil was reduced to per barrel 
based on volumes shipped in the fourth quarter of  we expect that this change will reduce tariff revenues by million annually 
under a tank rental reimbursement arrangement with the largest shipper on the texas system that begins in january  we will receive a reimbursement for the costs of renting tankage at webster 
this tank reimbursement is expected to increase revenues from the texas system by million annually  offsetting a portion of the expected decrease in tariff revenues 
we completed a hydrotest in the first quarter of that we believe will allow us to continue to operate the west columbia to webster segment of pipeline for service in heavy oil 
this oil will be shipped under a joint tariff with teppco 
the shippers agreed to an increase in this tariff during the fourth quarter of if we would continue to provide this service which will provide us with additional return on our investment in this segment 
we expect an annual increase in tariff revenues  based on volumes shipped in the fourth quarter of  of million 
denbury is the largest oil and gas producer in mississippi 
our mississippi pipeline is adjacent to several of denbury s existing and prospective oil fields 
there are mutual benefits to denbury and us due to this common production and transportation area 
as denbury continues to acquire and develop old oil fields using co based tertiary recovery operations  denbury expects to add crude oil gathering and co supply infrastructure to these fields 
further  as the fields are developed over time  it may create increased demand for our crude oil transportation services 
beginning in september  denbury began shipping on our mississippi pipeline rather than selling the crude oil to us to market and ship on our mississippi system 
we also restructured our tariffs to provide additional return on the investments we have made and will continue to make in the mississippi system 
we built a co pipeline to connect denbury s existing co pipeline to the brookhaven oil field in mississippi 
the agreement with denbury provides for a minimum capacity charge that will provide million of annual payments to us for eight years with a commodity charge for volumes in excess of a threshold volume 
the segments of crude oil pipeline we constructed to denbury s olive and brookhaven fields also have agreements providing for minimum capacity charges for ten years with commodity charges for volumes in excess of threshold volumes 
the annual payments under these crude oil agreements will provide a combined total of million of annual payments to us 
the brookhaven co and olive pipelines went into service in and the brookhaven oil pipeline is expected to begin service in the first quarter of we account for these arrangements as direct financing leases 
the production shipped from oil fields surrounding our jay system comes from a combination of new fields with estimated short production lives and older fields that have been producing for to years and are in the latter stages of their economic lives 
we believe that the highest and best use of the jay system would be to convert it to natural gas service 
we continue to review opportunities to effect such a conversion 
this initiative is in a very preliminary stage 
part of the process will involve finding alternative methods for us to continue to provide crude oil transportation services in the area 
while we believe this initiative has long term potential  it is not expected to have a substantial impact on us during or we will continue to evaluate opportunities to dispose of or to make further investments in components of this segment in order to improve its performance 
carbon dioxide co marketing operations in november  we acquired a volumetric production payment vpp of bcf of co from denbury and in september we acquired an additional bcf vpp 
denbury owns trillion cubic feet of estimated proved reserves of co in the jackson dome area near jackson  mississippi 
in addition to the production payments  denbury also assigned to us five of their existing long term co contracts with industrial customers 
denbury owns the pipeline that is used to transport the co to our customers as well as to its own tertiary recovery operations 
the volumetric production payments entitle us to a maximum daily quantity of co of  million cubic feet mcf per day through december    mcf per day for the calendar years through  and  mcf per day beginning in until we have received all volumes under the production payments 
under the terms of transportation agreements with denbury  denbury will process and deliver this co to our industrial customers and receive a fee from us of per mcf  subject to adjustments for inflation  for those transportation services 
the industrial customers treat the co and transport it to their own customers 
the primary industrial applications of co by these customers include beverage carbonation and food chilling and freezing 
based on denbury s and our experience in and  we can expect some seasonality in our sales of co the dominant months for beverage carbonation and freezing food are from april to october  when warm weather increases demand for beverages and the approaching holidays increase demand for frozen foods 
the average daily sales in mcfs of co for each quarter in and under these contracts were as follows quarter first   second   third   fourth   the terms of our contracts with the industrial customers include minimum take or pay and maximum delivery volumes 
the maximum daily contract quantity per year in the contracts totals  mcf 
under the minimum take or pay volumes  the customers must purchase a total of  mcf per day whether received or not 
any volume purchased under the take or pay provision in any year can then be recovered in a future year as long as the minimum requirement is met in that year 
in the three years ended december   all three customers have purchased more than their minimum take or pay quantities  as shown in the table above 
our five industrial contracts expire at various dates beginning in and extending through the sales contracts contain provisions for adjustments for inflation to sales prices based on the producer price index  with a minimum price 
operating results from continuing operations for our co marketing segment were as follows 
years ended december  in thousands revenues   marketing costs  segment margin  volumes per day from continuing operations co marketing mcf   the revenues  segment margin and average daily volumes reflected above for are for the two months that we owned the assets 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  we sold a significant portion of our texas pipeline system and the related crude oil gathering and marketing operations to teppco crude oil  lp additionally we sold other segments of our texas pipeline system that had been idled in to blackhawk pipeline  lp  an affiliate of multifuels  inc we abandoned in place other remaining segments not sold to these parties in teppco paid us million for the assets it acquired 
we incurred transaction costs of million which reduced the net proceeds to million 
teppco also assumed responsibility for million of unpaid royalties related to the crude oil purchase and sale contracts it assumed 
we entered into joint tariff agreements whereby teppco invoices  collects and shares with us the tariffs for transportation on the pipeline being sold and the segments we retained 
we also agreed not to compete with teppco in a county area in texas surrounding the pipeline for a five year period 
we retained responsibility for environmental matters related to the operations sold to teppco for the period prior to the sale date  subject to certain conditions 
teppco will pay the first  for each environmental claim up to an aggregate of  we would be responsible for any environmental claim in excess of that amount up to an aggregate total of million 
teppco has purchased an environmental insurance policy for amounts in excess of our million responsibility and we reimbursed teppco for one half of the policy premium 
our responsibility to indemnify teppco for environmental matters in connection with this transaction will cease in ten years 
we do not expect the effects of this indemnification to have a material effect on our results of operations in the future 
under the terms of the sale to blackhawk  we retained responsibility for any environmental matters related to the pipeline segments acquired by blackhawk that are attributable to operations through december  operating results from the discontinued operations for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands gathering and marketing and pipeline revenues   costs and expenses crude costs and field operating costs   pipeline operating costs   general and administrative depreciation and amortization   change in fair value of derivatives and other total costs and expenses   operating loss income from discontinued operations  gain on disposal of assets  loss income from operations from discontinued texas system before minority interests   during  we incurred costs totaling million related to the dismantlement of assets that we abandoned in year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues less crude costs and pipeline and field operating costs from discontinued operations in declined by million  with million of the decline resulting from crude oil gathering and marketing operations  and the remainder from pipeline operations 
margin from discontinued crude oil gathering and marketing operations declined due to the following an million decrease in margin due to an decrease in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  a percent decrease in wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in a million decrease in margin  and a million increase in field operating costs from termination benefits 
pipeline margin from discontinued operations decreased by million due to the following a two percent decrease in the average tariff on shipments resulting in a million decrease in revenue  an percent decrease in throughput between the two years  resulting in a million revenue decrease  and a million increase in pipeline operating costs in included in the pipeline operating costs in is million for demolition and disposal costs for tanks and other equipment that were not sold and no longer had any use to us 
we chose to perform this demolition in to reduce the taxable gain that would be allocated to many of our unitholders from the sale to teppco 
also included in is million for termination benefits incurred as a result of the sale to teppco 
other operating costs increased a total of million 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in revenues from sales of pipeline loss allowance barrels primarily as a result of higher crude oil market prices 
general and administrative expenses include the direct costs of individuals involved only with the assets sold 
the decrease in these costs resulted from the termination of those persons from our employment as a result of the sale 
the increase in depreciation in as compared to resulted from the elimination of the remaining book value of assets not sold that no longer had any use to us 
other costs and interest general and administrative expenses were as follows 
years ended december  in thousands expenses excluding the effect of stock appreciation rights plan    stock appreciation rights plan expense  total general and administrative expenses    year ended december  compared with year ended december  general and administrative expenses  excluding the effects of our stock appreciation rights sar plan  increased million in from the level 
in  we incurred expenses of million for professional services to assist us in the internal control documentation and assessment provisions of the sarbanes oxley act including additional audit fees related to this process 
legal fees were million less in the period  primarily due to a charge that we took in the period for unamortized legal and consultant costs related to a credit facility that was replaced 
other administrative costs increased million 
the sar plan for employees and directors is a long term incentive plan whereby rights are granted for the grantee to receive cash equal to the difference between the grant price and common unit price at date of exercise 
the rights vest over several years 
our unit price rose from at december  to at december  resulting in a million non cash increase to the accrual for this liability in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  general and administrative expenses  excluding the effects of the sar plan  increased million in from the level 
corporate governance costs including legal and consultant costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  increased directors fees and higher directors and officers insurance costs added million 
other general and administrative costs increased by million 
another factor contributing to this increase was the write off of million of unamortized legal and consultant costs related to credit agreement with citicorp 
the write off of unamortized costs was necessitated by the replacement of the citicorp credit facility in with a credit facility with bank of america 
under our bonus program  bonuses were eliminated unless distributions were being paid  which resulted in no accrual in we recorded a non cash charge of million in related to our sar plan 
depreciation  amortization and impairment expense increased by million in from the and levels of million  due to two main factors 
in  we wrote down the value of the segment of our mississippi system from liberty to baton rouge to its estimated salvage value  recording a charge of million 
we also had a full year of amortization of the co contracts in  which increased expense by million 
offsetting this increase was the cessation of depreciation on assets that were fully depreciated during and interest expense  net was as follows years ended december  in thousands interest expense  including commitment fees capitalized interest amortization and write off of facility fees interest income net interest expense  in  our net interest expense decreased by million 
interest expense and commitment fees increased due to variances in outstanding debt  increases in interest rates  and a june  increase in the size of our credit facility to million which increased commitment fees 
this increase was offset by a reduction in facility fees amortization and write off 
in  we wrote off the unamortized facility fees related to a credit facility that was replaced in march in  our net interest expense decreased by million from the amount 
the primary factor was a decrease in march of the size of our credit facility from million to million 
in  the larger amount of the credit facility resulted in higher commitment fees 
we expect our interest costs to increase in due to higher levels of outstanding debt and increases in market interest rates 
all of our debt is at variable rates based on market interest rates 
other operating charges 
in  we reached an agreement in principle with the federal and state regulatory authorities regarding the fines we would pay related to the spill that occurred in december in mississippi 
this agreement was finalized in and we paid a fine of million 
in the fourth quarter of we accrued million for this fine and in the third quarter of  we accrued an additional million 
net gain loss on disposal of surplus assets 
in and we sold surplus assets no longer in use in our operations 
in  we disposed of our seats on the nymex for million  resulting in a gain of million 
the changes we made in our business model to reduce our bulk and exchange activities eliminated our reasons for owning the nymex seats 
additionally  in  we sold surplus land  a building and surplus vehicles  resulting in additional cumulative net gains of million 
liquidity and capital resources capital resources in june  we replaced our existing bank credit facility with a group of banks led by bank of america as agent with a million senior secured bank credit facility the credit agreement with a group of five lenders including three of the previous banks 
the credit agreement consists of a million revolving line of credit for acquisitions and a million working capital revolving credit facility 
the facility matures in june the working capital portion of the credit agreement has a sub limit of million for working capital loans with the remainder of the million portion available for letters of credit  subject to a borrowing base calculation 
interest rates and fees under the credit agreement are slightly better than the terms of the prior facility 
the interest rates and fees under the working capital portion vary with the percentage of the facility being used in relation to the borrowing base 
at december   we had borrowed million under the working capital portion of the credit agreement and million under the acquisition portion 
due to the revolving nature of loans under the credit agreement  additional borrowings and periodic repayments and re borrowings may be made until the maturity date of june  at december   we had letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement totaling million  comprised of million and million for crude oil purchases related to december and january  respectively  and million related to other business obligations 
as we no longer purchase crude oil from denbury for shipment  we no longer provide denbury with letters of credit 
we were in compliance with the credit agreement covenants at december  we have no limitations on making distributions in our credit agreement  except as to the effects of distributions in covenant calculations 
the credit agreement requires we maintain a cash flow coverage ratio of to in general  this calculation compares operating cash inflows  as adjusted in accordance with the credit agreement  less maintenance capital expenditures  to the sum of interest expense and distributions 
at december   the calculation resulted in a ratio of to the credit agreement also requires that the level of operating cash inflows  as adjusted in accordance with the credit agreement  be at least million 
at december   the result of this calculation was million 
we will distribute our available cash to our unitholders each quarter if we are not in default of these covenants 
capital expenditures a summary of our capital expenditures in the three years ended december    and is as follows year ended december  in thousands maintenance capital expenditures texas pipeline system   mississippi pipeline system   jay pipeline system crude oil gathering assets administrative and other assets total maintenance capital expenditures   growth capital expenditures including construction in progress mississippi oil and co pipeline systems  crude oil gathering and other assets co marketing assets   total growth capital expenditures   total capital expenditures    maintenance capital expenditures in included station improvements in mississippi to handle increased volumes 
administrative assets included computer software and hardware 
in the period  maintenance capital expenditures included installation of pipeline satellite monitoring equipment on all three pipelines  and an upgrade to the west columbia to markham segment of our texas pipeline 
the expenditures on the mississippi system included additional improvements to the pipeline from soso to gwinville  where the crude release had occurred in december  to restore this segment to service 
in  we also improved the pipeline from gwinville to liberty to be able to handle increased volumes on that segment by upgrading pumps and meters and completing additional tankage 
growth capital expenditures in related to the acquisition in mississippi of right of way and the construction costs for a ten mile extension of our mississippi crude oil pipeline and a co pipeline extending from denbury s co pipeline to the brookhaven field 
this extension was completed during the fourth quarter of we also completed an approximately four mile extension from our existing crude oil pipeline to move crude oil from denbury s olive mccomb fields 
we also started construction of a  barrel tank at our mallalieu station to accommodate the additional volumes 
we acquired a second co volumetric production payment and related industrial sales contracts during the third quarter of growth capital expenditures in included the acquisition of a condensate storage facility in texas that was subsequently sold to teppco and the acquisition of the co assets from denbury 
although we have no commitments to make capital expenditures  based on the information available to us at this time  we currently anticipate that our maintenance capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
these expenditures are expected to relate primarily to our mississippi system  including corrosion control expenditures  minor facility improvements and improvements of the pipeline as a result of integrity management test results 
complying with department of transportation pipeline integrity management program imp regulations has been and will be a significant factor in determining the amount and timing of our capital expenditure requirements 
the imp regulations required that a baseline assessment be completed within seven years of march   with of the mileage assessed in the first three and one half years 
reassessment is then required every five years 
we expect to spend million in and million in for pipeline integrity testing that will be charged to pipeline operating expense as incurred 
as testing is completed  we are required to take prompt remedial action to address integrity issues raised by the assessment 
the rehabilitation action required as a result of the assessment and testing is expected to impact our capital expenditure program by requiring us to make improvements to our pipeline 
this creates a difficult budgeting and planning challenge as we cannot predict the results of pipeline testing until they are completed 
based on estimated improvements required from assessments made during through  we have estimated capital expenditures to be made during the imp assessment period from through these capital expenditure projections are based on very preliminary data regarding the cost of rehabilitation 
we will update these projections as we obtain additional information 
as we rehabilitate the mississippi system as a result of imp testing  we will also make improvements to handle the increased volumes more efficiently 
overall we expect to spend approximately million in through for these improvements 
we do not expect to incur any rehabilitation expenditures on the other systems during this period 
expenditures for capital assets to grow the partnership distribution will depend on our access to debt and capital discussed below in sources of future capital 
we will look for opportunities to acquire assets from other parties that meet our criteria for stable cash flows such as the two acquisitions discussed in acquisitions in above 
sources of future capital prior to  we funded our capital commitments from operating cash and borrowings under our bank facilities 
in  we issued common units to our general partner for cash and sold assets to fund growth 
during  we used our credit agreement to fund our capital expenditures 
our plans for the future include a combination of borrowings and the issuance of additional common units to the public 
the credit agreement provides us with million of capacity for acquisitions 
we expect to use our acquisition facility for the projects discussed under capital expenditures as well as other future projects 
the acquisition portion of the credit agreement is a revolving facility 
cash flows our primary sources of cash flows are operations  credit facilities  and in  proceeds from the sale of a portion of our operations 
additionally in  we issued limited partner interests to our general partner and received cash 
our primary uses of cash flows are capital expenditures and distributions 
a summary of our cash flows is as follows year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    operating 
net cash from operating activities for each year have been comprised of the following year ended december  in thousands net income    depreciation  amortization and impairment    loss gain on sales of assets  derivative related non cash adjustments  payments received under direct financing leases other non cash items   changes in components of working capital  net    net cash from operating activities    our operating cash flows are affected significantly by changes in items of working capital 
we have had situations where other parties have prepaid for purchases or paid more than was due  resulting in fluctuations in one period as compared to the next until the party recovers the excess payment 
additionally  in  we paid the million in fines assessed in connection with the mississippi oil release in  which utilized our cash flows 
the accrual for this payment was made in and the timing of capital expenditures and the related effect on our recorded liabilities also affects operating cash flows 
our accounts receivable settle monthly and collection delays generally relate only to discrepancies or disputes as to the appropriate price  volume or quality of crude oil delivered 
of the million aggregate receivables on our consolidated balance sheet at december   approximately million  or  were less than days past the invoice date 
investing 
cash flows used in investing activities in were million as compared to million in capital expenditures for construction of pipeline assets and the acquisition of a second volumetric payment from denbury were the primary uses of cash for investing 
cash flows used in investing activities in were million 
in we sold portions of our texas pipeline system as well as other assets for million net  and we expended million to acquire the co assets 
additionally we expended million for other capital improvements 
these expenditures included improvements on our mississippi pipeline system and improvements totaling approximately million on the texas assets sold to teppco in october and other equipment improvements 
in we expended million for property and equipment additions 
these expenditures included replacement of pipe in mississippi and texas and upgrades to pipeline stations in mississippi to handle larger volumes of crude oil throughput  including building new tanks 
offsetting these expenditures in  were sales of surplus assets from which we received million 
in early  we sold our two seats on the nymex for million as discussed above 
we also received million from the sale of excess land with a building 
financing 
in  financing activities provided net cash of million 
borrowings provided million of cash flow 
we utilized million of these funds to pay fees related to the credit agreement we obtained in june distributions to our partners utilized million 
in  financing activities provided net cash of million 
in november  our general partner acquired from us  newly issued common units for million 
we also increased our outstanding debt by million 
we utilized million of these funds to pay credit facility issuance fees 
distributions to our partners utilized million 
net cash expended for financing activities was million in in we reduced long term debt outstanding at year end by million from the balance at december  we also paid a special distribution of per unit in december  which utilized million of cash 
distributions as a master limited partnership  the key consideration of our unitholders is the amount and reliability of our distribution  and our prospects for distribution increases 
we are required by our partnership agreement to distribute of our available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to the general partner 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts less cash disbursements adjusted for net changes to reserves 
the target minimum quarterly distribution mqd for each quarter is per unit 
for the fourth quarter of and for all of  we did not pay any regular quarterly distributions 
we did pay a special distribution of per unit million in total in december to help mitigate the tax effects of income allocations for that year 
beginning with the distribution for the first quarter of  we paid a regular quarterly distribution of per unit million in total per quarter 
beginning with the distribution for the fourth quarter of  which was paid in february  we increased our quarterly distribution to per unit in total 
our general partner is entitled to receive incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in our partnership agreement 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  the general partner is entitled to receive of any distributions in excess of per unit  of any distributions in excess of per unit  and of any distributions in excess of per unit  without duplication 
we have not paid any incentive distributions 
the likelihood and timing of the payment of any incentive distributions will depend on our ability to make accretive acquisitions and generate cash flows from of those acquisitions 
we do not expect to make incentive distributions during we believe we will be able to sustain a regular quarterly distribution at per unit during our ability to increase distributions during will depend in part on our success in developing and executing capital projects and making accretive acquisitions  the results of our integrity management program testing  and our ability to generate sustained improvements in the gathering and marketing segment 
available cash before reserves for the year ended december  is as follows in thousands net loss  depreciation  amortization and impairment  cash received from direct financing leases not included in income cash effects from sales of certain asset sales non cash charges  maintenance capital expenditures available cash before reserves  we have reconciled available cash a non gaap liquidity measure to cash flow from operating activities the gaap measure for the year ended december  below 
non gaap financial measure we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management 
available cash is a liquidity measure used by our management to compare cash flows generated by the partnership to the cash distribution we pay to our limited partners and the general partner 
this is an important financial measure to our public unitholders since it is an indicator of our ability to provide a cash return on their investment 
specifically  this financial measure tells investors whether or not the partnership is generating cash flows at a level that can support a quarterly cash distribution to our partners 
lastly  available cash also referred to as distributable cash flow is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships 
several adjustments to net income are required to calculate available cash 
these adjustments include the addition of non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization expense  miscellaneous non cash adjustments such as the addition of decreases or the subtraction of increases in the accrual for our stock appreciation rights plan expense and the value of financial instruments  and the subtraction of maintenance capital expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures as defined by gaap to replace or enhance partially or fully depreciated assets in order to sustain the existing operating capacity or efficiency of our assets and extend their useful lives 
see distributions above 
the reconciliation of available cash a non gaap liquidity measure to cash flow from operating activities the gaap measure for the year ended december   is as follows in thousands year ended december  cash flows from operating activities  adjustments to reconcile operating cash flows to available cash maintenance capital expenditures proceeds from sales of certain assets  net of gains and losses recorded amortization of credit facility issuance fees net effect of changes in operating accounts not included in calculation of available cash  available cash before reserves  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligation and commercial commitments in addition to the credit agreement discussed above  we have contractual obligations under operating leases as well as commitments to purchase crude oil 
the table below summarizes our obligations and commitments at december  payments due by period and and after contractual cash obligations total in thousands long term debt   interest payments   operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations     interest on our long term debt is at market based rates 
amount shown for interest payments represents interest that would be paid if the debt outstanding at december  remained outstanding through the maturity date of june  and interest rates remained at the december  market levels through june  the unconditional purchase obligations included above are contracts to purchase crude oil  generally at market based prices 
for purposes of this table  market prices at december   were used to value the obligations 
actual obligations may differ from the amounts included above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  or financing partnerships  other than as disclosed under contractual obligation and commercial commitments above  nor do we have any debt or equity triggers based upon our unit or commodity prices 
other matters crude oil contamination we were named one of the defendants in a complaint filed on january   in the th district court of harris county  texas  cause no 
pennzoil quaker state company pqs was seeking property damages  loss of use and business interruption suffered as a result of a fire and explosion that occurred at the pennzoil quaker state refinery in shreveport  louisiana  on january  pqs claimed the fire and explosion were caused  in part  by genesis selling to pqs crude oil that was contaminated with organic chlorides 
in december  our insurers settled this litigation for million 
the settlement of this litigation had no effect on our results of operations 
pqs is also a defendant in five consolidated class action mass tort actions brought by neighbors living in the vicinity of the pqs shreveport  louisiana refinery in the first judicial district court  caddo parish  louisiana  cause nos 
 a 
 b   a   a  and  c 
pqs has brought third party claims demand against genesis and others for indemnity with respect to the fire and explosion of january  we believe that the claims against genesis are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 
insurance we maintain insurance of various types that we consider adequate to cover our operations and properties 
the insurance policies are subject to deductibles that we consider reasonable 
the policies do not cover every potential risk associated with operating our assets  including the potential for a loss of significant revenues 
consistent with the coverage available in the industry  our policies provide limited pollution coverage  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental pollution events 
additionally  as a result of the events of september  the cost of insurance available to the industry has risen significantly  and insurers have excluded or reduced coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism and sabotage 
since september   warnings have been issued by various agencies of the united states government to advise owners and operators of energy assets that those assets may be a future target of terrorist organizations 
any future terrorist attacks on our assets  or assets of our customers or competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that we are adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others as a result of our operations 
however  we cannot assure you that an event not fully insured or indemnified against will not materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable

risk factors risk factors related to our business we may not have sufficient cash from operations to pay the current level of quarterly distribution following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner 
the amount of cash we distribute on our units principally depends upon margins we generate from our crude oil gathering and marketing operations  margins from the pipeline transportation operations and sales of co  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the prices at which we purchase and sell crude oil  the volumes of crude oil  co and natural gas we transport  the volumes of co we sell  the level of our operating costs  the level of our general and administrative costs  and prevailing economic conditions 
in addition  the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors that include the costs of acquisitions  if any  our debt service requirements  fluctuations in our working capital  the level of capital expenditures we make  restrictions on distributions contained in our debt instruments  our ability to borrow under our working capital facility to pay distributions  and the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner in its sole discretion in the conduct of our business 
you should also be aware that our ability to pay quarterly distributions each quarter depends primarily on our cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and is not solely a function of profitability  which will be affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses and we may not make distributions during periods when we record net income 
the success of our crude oil gathering  marketing and pipeline operations is dependent upon increases in the availability of crude oil supplies and our ability to secure those supplies 
securing additional supplies of crude oil from increased production by oil companies and by aggressive lease gathering efforts depends partially on the ability of oil producers to increase production 
factors affecting an increase in production can include the prevailing market price for oil  the exploration and production budgets of the major and independent oil companies  the depletion rate of existing reservoirs  the success of new wells drilled  environmental concerns  regulatory initiatives and other matters that are beyond our control 
the profitability of our crude oil gathering and marketing operations depends primarily on the volumes of crude oil we purchase and gather 
we must replace natural declines in crude oil production from depleting wells or volumes lost to competitors with contracts for new supplies of crude oil to maintain the volumes of crude oil we purchase 
the ability of producers to maintain or increase production depends upon the prevailing market price of oil  the exploration budgets of major and independent oil producers  the depletion rate of existing reservoirs  the success of new wells drilled  environmental concerns  regulatory initiatives and other matters beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that production of crude oil will rise to sufficient levels to allow us to maintain or increase the amounts of crude oil transported on our pipeline and gathering assets 
our operations are dependent upon demand for crude oil by refiners in the midwest and on the gulf coast 
any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business 
demand for crude oil also is dependent on the impact of future economic conditions  fuel conservation measures  alternative fuel requirements  government regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices  all of which could reduce demand 
we face intense competition in our crude oil gathering and marketing activities 
our competitors include other crude oil pipelines  the major integrated oil companies  their marketing affiliates and independent gatherers  brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes  financial resources and experience 
some of these competitors have capital resources many times greater than ours and control substantially greater supplies of crude oil 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our crude oil gathering and marketing activities 
in those cases where we provide division order services for crude oil purchased at the wellhead  we may be responsible for distribution of proceeds to all parties 
in other cases  we pay all of or a portion of the production proceeds to an operator who distributes these proceeds to the various interest owners 
these arrangements expose us to operator credit risk 
as a result  we must determine that operators have sufficient financial resources to make such payments and distributions and to indemnify and defend us in case of a protest  action or complaint 
even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly  there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses in dealings with other parties 
the profitability of our crude oil pipeline operations depends on the volume of crude oil shipped by third parties and on our interconnections with other crude oil pipelines 
third party shippers do not have long term contractual commitments to ship crude oil on our pipelines 
a decision by a shipper to substantially reduce or cease to ship volumes of crude oil on our pipelines could cause a significant decline in our revenues 
additionally  in mississippi  we are dependent on interconnections with other pipelines to provide shippers with a market for their crude oil  and in texas  we are dependent on interconnections with other pipelines to provide shippers with transportation to our pipeline 
any reduction of throughput available to our shippers on these interconnecting pipelines as a result of testing  pipeline repair  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in reduced throughput on our pipelines that would adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
fluctuations in demand for crude oil  such as those caused by refinery downtime or shutdowns  can negatively affect our operating results 
reduced demand in areas we service with our pipelines can result in less demand for our transportation services 
in addition  certain of our field and pipeline operating costs and expenses are fixed and do not vary with the volumes we gather and transport 
these costs and expenses may not decrease ratably or at all should we experience a reduction in our volumes gathered by truck or transmitted by our pipelines 
as a result  we may experience declines in our margin and profitability if our volumes decrease 
our operations are subject to federal and state environmental and safety regulations and laws related to environmental protection and operational safety 
our crude oil gathering and pipeline operations are subject to the risk of incurring substantial environmental and safety related costs and liabilities 
these costs and liabilities could rise under increasingly strict environmental and safety laws  including regulations and enforcement policies  or claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations 
if we are unable to recover such resulting costs through higher tariffs or insurance reimbursements  our cash flows and distributions to our unitholders could be materially affected 
the transportation and storage of crude oil involves a risk that crude oil and related hydrocarbons may be suddenly or gradually released into the environment  which may result in substantial expenditures for a response action  significant government penalties  liability to government agencies for natural resources damages  liability to private parties for personal injury or property damages  and significant business interruption 
our co operations are exposed to risks related to denbury resources operation of their co fields  equipment and pipeline 
because denbury resources produces the co and transports the co to our customers  any major failure of its operations could have an impact on our ability to meet our obligations to our co customers 
we have no other supply of co or method to transport it to our customers 
the co supplied by denbury resources to us for our sale to our customers could fail to meet the quality standards in the contracts due to impurities or water vapor content 
if the co were below specifications  we could be contractually obligated to provide compensation to our customers for the costs incurred in raising the co quality to serviceable levels required by our contracts 
fluctuations in demand for co by our industrial customers could materially impact our profitability 
our customers are not obligated to purchase volumes in excess of specified minimum amounts in our contracts 
as a result  fluctuations in our customers demand due to market forces or operational problems could result in a reduction in our revenues from our sales of co our wholesale co industrial marketing operations are dependent on three customers 
if one or more of those customers experience financial difficulties such that they fail to purchase their required minimum take or pay volumes  our cash flows could be adversely affected 
we believe these three customers are credit worthy  but we can not assure you that an unanticipated deterioration in their ability to meet their obligations to us might not occur 
the terms of our credit facility may limit our ability to borrow additional funds  make distributions to unitholders  or capitalize on business opportunities 
as of december   our total outstanding long term debt was approximately  our credit facility includes limitations on our ability to make distributions to our unitholders  through covenant requirements  and requires approval of lenders to take certain actions 
any refinancing of our current indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions 
terrorist attacks aimed at the partnership s facilities could adversely affect the business 
on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scale 
since the september attacks  the us government has issued warnings that energy assets  specifically the nation s pipeline infrastructure  may be the future targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks 
any future terrorist attack at our facilities  those of our customers and  in some cases  those of other pipelines  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
tax risks to common unitholders the irs could treat us as a corporation far tax purposes  which would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
the after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the irs on this or any other tax matter affecting us 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of 
distributions to you may be taxed again as corporate dividends  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced 
if we were treated as a corporation  there would be a material reduction in the after tax return to the unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units 
moreover  treatment of us as a corporation would materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily related to volatility in crude oil prices and interest rates 
our primary price risk relates to the effect of crude oil price fluctuations on our inventories and the fluctuations each month in grade and location differentials and their effect on future contractual commitments 
we utilize nymex commodity based futures contracts and forward contracts to hedge our exposure to these market price fluctuations as needed 
at december   we had no financial instruments or contracts outstanding to hedge commodity risks 
we are also exposed to market risks due to the floating interest rates on our credit facility 
our debt bears interest at the libor or prime rate plus the applicable margin 
we do not hedge our interest rates 
the average interest rate presented below is based upon rates in effect at december  the carrying value of our debt in our credit facility approximates fair value primarily because interest rates fluctuate with prevailing market rates  and the credit spread on outstanding borrowings reflects market 
expected year of maturity in thousands long term debt variable rate  average interest rate
