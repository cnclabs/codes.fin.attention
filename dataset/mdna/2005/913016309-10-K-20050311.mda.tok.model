item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we operate ambulatory surgery centers and private surgical hospitals in the united states and the united kingdom 
as of december   we operated facilities  consisting of in the united states and three in the united kingdom 
during september  we sold our operations in spain  where we had operated nine short stay surgical facilities 
most of our us facilities are jointly owned with local physicians and a not for profit healthcare system that has other healthcare businesses in the region 
at december   we had agreements with not for profit healthcare systems providing for the joint ownership of of our existing us facilities and also providing a framework for the planning and construction of additional facilities in the future  including all six facilities we are currently constructing as well as additional projects under development 
all of our us facilities include physician owners 
our us facilities  consisting of ambulatory surgery centers and private surgical hospitals each are generally referred to herein as short stay surgical facilities  specialize in non emergency surgical cases  the volume of which has steadily increased over the past two decades due in part to advancements in medical technology 
these facilities earn a fee from patients  insurance companies  or other payors in exchange for providing the facility and related services a surgeon requires in order to perform a surgical case 
in addition  we in turn earn a monthly fee from each facility we operate in exchange for managing its operations 
all but three of our facilities are located in the us  where we have focused increasingly on adding facilities with not for profit healthcare system partners hospital partners 
from december  to december   the number of facilities we own jointly with hospital partners more than doubled  increasing from to in the united kingdom we operate private hospitals  which supplement the services provided by the government sponsored healthcare system 
our patients choose to receive care at private hospitals primarily because of waiting lists to receive diagnostic procedures or elective surgery at government sponsored facilities and pay us either from personal funds or through private insurance  which is offered by an increasing number of employers as a benefit to their employees 
since acquiring our first two facilities in the united kingdom in  we have expanded selectively by adding a third facility and increasing the capacity and services offered at each facility 
our continued growth and success depends on our ability to continue to grow volumes at our existing facilities  to successfully open new facilities we develop  and to maintain productive relationships with our 
table of contents hospital partners 
we believe we will have significant opportunities to operate more facilities with hospital partners in the future in existing and new markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements under gaap requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions which impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period 
estimates are based on information available as of the date financial statements are prepared 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and that require management s most subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include our policies and estimates regarding consolidation  revenue recognition  income taxes  and intangible assets 
consolidation generally  we do not wholly own the facilities we operate 
as discussed in results of operations  we operate all of our us facilities through joint ventures with physicians 
increasingly  these joint ventures also include a not for profit healthcare system as a partner 
we generally have a leadership role in these facilities through a significant voting and economic interest and a contract to manage each facility s operations  but the degree of control we have varies from facility to facility 
accordingly  as of december   we consolidated the financial results of of the facilities we operate  including one in which we hold no ownership but control its operations through a long term service agreement  and account for under the equity method 
we hold no ownership in the other facility  which we currently operate under a management contract but do not control 
in addition  we account for passive investments  which represent less than of our investment in unconsolidated affiliates  under the cost method 
our determination of the appropriate consolidation method to follow with respect to our investments in subsidiaries and affiliates is based on the amount of control we have  combined with our ownership level  in the underlying entity 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and other subsidiaries over which we have control 
our investments in subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  but do not control including subsidiaries where we have less than ownership  are accounted for on the equity method 
our other investments  which are not significant in amount  are accounted for using the cost method 
accounting for an investment as consolidated versus equity method generally has no impact on our net income or stockholders equity in any accounting period  but does impact individual income statement and balance sheet balances 
however  if control or influence aspects of an equity method investment were different  it could result in us being required to account for an investment by consolidation or using the cost method 
under the cost method  the investor does not record its share of income or losses of the investee until it receives dividends or distributions from the investee 
conversely  under either consolidation or equity method accounting  the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity s net income or loss based on its ownership percentage 
at december   less than million of the company s total investment in unconsolidated affiliates of million relates to investments that are accounted for using the cost method and the remaining total of more than million represents investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for using the equity method 

table of contents revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as updated  which has four basic criteria that must be met before revenue is recognized existence of persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria 
over of the surgical cases performed at our facilities are performed under contracted or government mandated fee schedules or discount arrangements 
the patient service revenues recorded for these cases are recorded at the contractual value at the time of billing 
the predictability of the remaining revenue  for which contractual adjustments are estimated based on historical collections  is such that adjustments to these estimates in subsequent periods have not had a material impact in any period presented 
if the discount percentage used in estimating accounts receivable for the cases not billed pursuant to fee schedules were changed by  our after tax net income would change by approximately  the collection cycle for patient services revenue is relatively short  typically ranging from to days depending upon payor and geographic norms  which allows us to evaluate our estimates frequently 
our revenues earned under management and other service contracts are typically based upon objective formulas driven by an entity s financial performance and are generally earned and paid monthly 
our accounts receivable are comprised of receivables from both the united kingdom and the united states 
as of december   approximately of our total accounts receivable were attributable to our uk business 
because our uk facilities only treat patients who have demonstrated ability to pay  our uk patients arrange for payment prior to treatment 
as a result  our bad debt expense in the uk is very low 
in it was only  which is of our total uk revenues of million 
in addition  our average days sales outstanding in the uk was as of december  our us accounts receivable were approximately of our total accounts receivable as of december  in  uninsured or self pay revenues only accounted for and of our us revenue and accounts receivable  respectively 
insurance revenues including government payors accounted for and of our us revenue and accounts receivable  respectively 
our us facilities primarily perform routine elective surgery that is typically scheduled in advance by physicians who have already seen the patient 
as part of our internal control processes  we verify benefits  obtain insurance authorization  calculate patient financial responsibility and notify the patient of their responsibility  all prior to surgery 
the nature of our business is such that we do not have any significant receivables that are pending approval from third party payors 
we also manage our accounts receivable and focus our collection efforts on aged accounts receivable 
however  due to complexities involved in insurance reimbursements and inherent limitations in verification procedures  our business will always have some level of bad debt expense 
in  our bad debt expense attributable to us revenue was  down from in in addition  as of december   our average days sales outstanding in the us was  and the aging of our us accounts receivable was less than days old  between and days and over days old 
our us bad debt allowance at december  represented of our us accounts receivable balance 
due to the nature of our business  management relies upon the aging of accounts receivable as its primary tool to estimate bad debt expense 
therefore  we reserve for bad debt based solely upon the aging of accounts receivable  without differentiating by payor source 
we write off accounts on an individual basis based on that aging 
we believe our reserve policy allows us to accurately estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
if  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
intangible assets we also consider our accounting policy regarding intangible assets to be a critical accounting policy given the significance of intangible assets as compared to our total assets and the changes in accounting for intangible assets required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which was issued by the financial accounting standards board on july  and was adopted by us as of january  sfas no 
requires the cessation of amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires that goodwill and all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually 
we adopted this standard on january   determining that our reporting units are at the operating segment country level  and that the majority of our intangible assets  which consist primarily of contracts to manage certain facilities  have indefinite useful lives 
neither the transitional impairment tests performed as of january   nor the annual tests for impairment performed in each succeeding year  identified any impairment of the carrying value of any reporting unit or of any indefinite lived intangible assets 
in addition  we continue to review the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances change in a manner that indicates their carrying values may not be recoverable 
discontinued operations effective september   we sold our spanish operations  receiving proceeds of million  net of a million tax payment made in the fourth quarter of collection of a portion of the sales proceeds was deferred until january  at which time we expect to collect an additional million in cash 
we recorded an after tax gain of million on the sale  which is reflected in discontinued operations 
the results of our spanish operations have been reclassified  for and all prior periods presented  to discontinued operations 
acquisitions  equity investments and development projects during  six surgery centers and two surgical hospitals developed by us in the united states opened and began performing cases 
effective december  we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in san antonio  texas  for approximately million in cash 
effective november   we acquired specialty surgicenters  inc  which operates four surgical centers  and concurrently acquired a portion of the minority ownership interests in one of these facilities for aggregate consideration of approximately million in cash 
we subsequently acquired a portion of the minority ownership interest in another one of these facilities for approximately million 
effective october   we acquired same day surgery  llc  which owns five multi specialty surgery centers in metropolitan chicago  and concurrently acquired a portion of the minority ownership interests in four of these facilities for approximately million in cash 
effective august   we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in dallas  texas in which we had previously owned a noncontrolling interest  for million in cash 
effective july   we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in reading  pennsylvania  for approximately million in cash 

table of contents effective may   we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in austintown  ohio  in which we had previously owned a noncontrolling interest  for million in cash 
effective january   we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in torrance  california in which we had previously owned a noncontrolling interest 
the million cost was paid in cash in december we also engage in investing transactions that are not business combinations  consisting primarily of purchases and sales of noncontrolling equity interests in surgical facilities and the investment of additional cash in surgical facilities under development 
during the year ended december   these transactions resulted in net cash outflows totaling million  of which million was paid to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a surgical hospital and an ambulatory surgery center in oklahoma city  oklahoma  million to acquire additional ownership in a surgery center in los angeles  california  and million to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a surgery center near baltimore  maryland 
during the year ended december   these transactions resulted in net cash outflows totaling million  of which million was paid to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a surgery center in torrance  california  million was paid to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a recently constructed facility in dallas  texas  and million of previously deferred purchase price was paid to the former owners of a facility in a suburb of dallas  texas based on the financial performance of that facility 
during  three surgery centers and one surgical hospital developed by us in the united states opened and began performing cases 
during june  we acquired a interest in an ambulatory surgery center in austin  texas for million in cash 
during april  we acquired a private surgical hospital in london  england for approximately million million  of which the payment of approximately million million remains deferred pending the resolution of certain contingencies 
during  four surgery centers and two private surgical hospitals developed by us in the united states opened and began performing cases 
in december  we acquired an additional of a surgery center in torrance  california  in which we had previously been a minority owner  for million in cash  bringing our total ownership in the facility to as of december  and triggering our consolidation of the facility in our financial statements 
in october  we acquired an interest in a surgery center in lyndhurst  ohio  for million in cash 
in august  with an effective date of july   we acquired an additional interest in a surgery center in arlington  texas arlington for total consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million of our common stock  bringing our total ownership interest in the center to 
because we own a majority of a subsidiary that owns a majority of the surgery center and maintains effective control through this ownership interest and through our operation of the center pursuant to a management contract  we consolidated the results of arlington s operations in our financial statements 
in june  we acquired a interest in a surgery center in middleburg heights  ohio  a suburb of cleveland  for million in cash 
in may  we acquired a interest in a surgery center in corpus christi  texas for million in cash 
in march  we acquired surgicoe corporation  which owned  managed  and developed surgical facilities in georgia  oklahoma  and texas 
we paid the shareholders of surgicoe approximately million in cash 

table of contents sources of revenue revenues primarily include net patient service revenue for the facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes  which are typically those in which we have ownership interests of greater than or otherwise maintain effective control  management and administrative services revenue  consisting of the fees that we earn from managing the facilities that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes and the fees we earn from providing certain consulting and administrative services to physicians 
our consolidated revenues and expenses do not include the management fees we earn from operating the facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes as those fees are charged to subsidiaries and thus eliminate in consolidation 
the following table summarizes our revenues by type and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  net patient service revenue management and administrative services revenue total revenue net patient service revenue consists of the revenues earned by facilities we consolidate for financial reporting purposes 
these revenues increased as a percentage of our total revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding prior year period  primarily as a result of our increasing the number of facilities we consolidate for financial reporting purposes by eleven from december  to december  while we also added eleven unconsolidated facilities during this time period  the revenues we derive from unconsolidated facilities are limited to fees we earn for managing their operations  and thus adding an unconsolidated facility generally increases our revenues by far less than adding a consolidated facility 
this shift in percentages was minimal for the twelve month period ended december  given that we only added four consolidated facilities compared to seven unconsolidated facilities during our management and administrative services revenues are earned from the following types of activities years ended december  management of surgical facilities consulting and other services provided to physicians and related entities total management and administrative service revenues the following table summarizes our revenues by operating segment years ended december  united states united kingdom total revenues earned in the united kingdom increased as a percentage of our overall revenues in  primarily due to the weakening us dollar 
the dollar weakened against the british pound by during the dollar weakened by during  the impact of which was offset by the growth of our us facilities 

table of contents equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates the following table reflects the summarized results of the unconsolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method of accounting dollars in thousands years ended december  total revenues depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  net net income long term debt uspi s equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates uspi s implied weighted average ownership percentage based on affiliates net income uspi s implied weighted average ownership percentage based on affiliates debt unconsolidated facilities operated at period end our weighted average percentage ownership in our unconsolidated affiliates is calculated as uspi s equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates divided by the total net income of unconsolidated affiliates for each respective period 
this percentage is lower during the twelve months ended december  than in year ended and  primarily as a result of losses incurred at facilities recently opened or under development 
our weighted average percentage ownership in our unconsolidated affiliates is calculated as the total debt of each unconsolidated affiliate  multiplied by the percentage ownership uspi held in the affiliate as of the end of each respective period  divided by the total debt of all of the unconsolidated affiliates as of the end of each respective period 
results of operations the following table summarizes certain statements of income items expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  total revenues equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization operating income minority interests in income of consolidated entities interest and other expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations net income 
table of contents executive summary during we continued to grow our existing facilities as well as to develop new facilities and to add others selectively through acquisition 
we also disposed of our spanish operations in september  resulting in an after tax gain of million and net cash of million  much of which was spent on acquiring us based facilities during the fourth quarter  when we invested million in acquiring ownership interests in operational and developing facilities in the united states 
on an overall basis  we continue to experience increases in the volume of services we are providing and in the average rates at which our facilities are reimbursed for those services  resulting in revenue growth at the facilities we owned during both and same store facilities 
at most of our facilities  these revenue increases have outpaced increases in operating expenses  resulting in improvements in most facilities operating margins as compared to the prior year 
however  slower revenue growth  driven by reductions in reimbursement levels in some markets  and the performance of four facilities  two of which were recently opened and two of which wound down operations before relocating near the end of  have adversely impacted our overall operating margins during  most significantly during the second half of the unfavorable impact of these factors more than offset the improved same store operating margins and the leveraging of our corporate overhead  resulting in our overall operating margin decreasing in by basis points  as compared to the prior year 
we continue to pursue the strategy of having a hospital partner  where practical  in addition to physician partners in each local us market  which we believe improves the long term potential of our surgical facilities 
the overall proportion of our facilities that have a hospital partner continues to grow  and all but one of the facilities we are currently developing involve a hospital partner 
revenues increases in the volume of surgical cases in the us and of patient admissions for our hospitals in the united kingdom continue to drive increases in our revenues  as does an increase in the average rate of reimbursement for the surgeries performed at our us facilities 
during the third and fourth quarters of  our domestic case volumes and average rate of reimbursement grew at slower rates than in the first six months of the year 
while overall case growth remained strong in  our case volume was adversely affected by two primary factors 
first  the lapse of a managed care contract in one market during the third quarter of led to our performing fewer cases at certain surgery centers 
second  domestic case volume grew more slowly overall as two of our facilities wound down their operations before relocating to newer buildings and being merged into joint venture relationships with hospital partners near the end of our average rate of reimbursement is being adversely impacted by new  lower rates of reimbursement for workers compensation cases performed at our surgery centers in california and texas  which went into effect in january and september  respectively  and additionally by the lapse of the managed care contract described above 
nevertheless  the growth of our same store facilities  summarized in the following table  continues to be the most significant component of our overall increase in revenues 
years ended december  united states facilities net revenue surgical cases net revenue per case united kingdom facilities net revenue using actual exchange rates net revenue using constant exchange rates 
table of contents growth in same store facilities  compared to the prior year 
our overall domestic same store growth in net revenue per case was favorably impacted by the growth at our eight same store surgical hospitals  which on average perform more complex cases than ambulatory surgery centers 
for the year ended  the net revenue per case of our same store ambulatory surgery centers excluding surgical hospitals increased compared to the corresponding prior year period 
this rate of growth was slower than in prior years largely as a result of the workers compensation reimbursement changes and lapse of the managed care contract described above 
measures current year using prior year exchange rates 
we have experienced strong year over year growth at the highgate facility since acquiring it during the second quarter of as well as steady increases in the revenues of the oncology center on the campus of our parkside facility  which became operational during the third quarter of joint ventures with not for profit hospitals the addition of new facilities continues to be more heavily weighted to us surgical facilities with a hospital partner  both as we initiate joint venture agreements with new systems and as we add facilities to our existing arrangements 
facilities have been added to hospital joint ventures both through construction of new facilities de novos and through our contribution of our equity interests in existing facilities into a hospital joint venture structure  effectively creating three way joint ventures by sharing our ownership in these facilities with a hospital partner while leaving the existing physician ownership intact 
all but one of the six facilities we are currently constructing involve a hospital partner  as do all of the other projects currently in the earlier stages of development 
the following table summarizes our facilities as of december   and united states facilities with a hospital partner without a hospital partner total us facilities united kingdom facilities spain facilities total facilities operated change from prior year end de novo newly constructed acquisition sale of spanish operations total increase in number of facilities at december   physicians own a portion of all of these facilities 
we sold all nine of our spanish facilities during the third quarter of facility operating margins on an overall basis  the increases in revenue at our same store facilities have continued to outpace the increases in operating expenses  resulting in improved operating margins at most of our facilities during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
however  several factors are contributing to a reduction in operating margins at some facilities  particularly during the third and fourth quarters of  which has caused our overall same store operating margins to increase by a smaller amount for the year ended december  as compared to and the downward pressure on revenues in some markets  as discussed above  was not in the aggregate accompanied by a corresponding decrease in personnel and facility 
table of contents costs 
while some of the factors involved  such as the lower operating margins generated at two surgical hospitals we opened during the second quarter of  are not expected to be permanently significant factors  reductions in reimbursement due to factors such as the workers compensation rate decreases in california and texas  and the lapse of the managed care contract discussed above could occur elsewhere in the future 
the following table summarizes changes in our same store operating margins see footnote below year ended december  united states facilities with a hospital partner bps bps bps without a hospital partner total us facilities united kingdom facilities bps bps bps operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by total revenues 
this table aggregates all of the same store facilities we operate using of their results 
this does not represent the overall margin for uspi s operations in either the us or western europe because we have a variety of ownership levels in the facilities we operate  and facilities open for less than a year are excluded from same store calculations 
the greatest increases in revenues during were achieved at locations that earn lower margins than the average for our uk facilities 
the margins of the highgate facility  which we acquired during the second quarter of  and of the parkside oncology center we opened during the third quarter of increased in compared to  but they remain lower than the margins of our other two uk facilities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by growth of our us same store facilities  which performed more surgical cases and received an average of approximately more per case in than in this us growth rate was slower than in the prior year largely as a result of decreases in rates of reimbursement for workers compensation cases in california and texas and due to the lapse of a managed care contract in one market 
our same store uk facilities revenue excluding exchange rate fluctuations increased in as activity increased at the hospital and cancer center we added during additionally  revenues increased by million in due to our acquiring facilities or significantly increasing our ownership level in facilities we already operated  and by million due to the us dollar being weaker against the british pound in than in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of growth in case volumes and improved operating margins at our same store facilities 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased as a percentage of revenues from to primarily as a result of our same facility margin improvement and leveraging of corporate overhead being more than offset by the unfavorable impact of two surgical hospitals we opened during the second quarter of  which are not yet operating at capacity 
our new and newly expanded facilities  particularly the surgical hospitals  hire staff and become fully equipped for a relative high number of surgical cases in their initial months of operations  but the case volumes are not high enough initially to result in operating margins that are as favorable as those generated by our more mature facilities 
in addition  we experienced revenue reductions due to reimbursement factors discussed above and due to the relocation of two facilities that were not accompanied by proportional decreases in operating expenses 

table of contents operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating income  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year  primarily as a result of our improved same facility operating margins and leveraging of corporate overhead being more than offset by the lower margins generated at our recently opened facilities and the slower growth of revenues discussed above 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this amount increased due primarily as a result of depreciation of assets added through acquisitions and newly opened facilities 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to our increased revenue 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our borrowing a portion of the costs of developing and expanding facilities 
other expense  net of other income increased million  or  to million of other expense for the year ended december  from million of other income for the year ended december   primarily due to the million loss on early termination of credit facility  which management elected to terminate upon receiving net cash proceeds of million from the sale of the spanish operations 
minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our adding a net total of consolidated facilities during and additionally due to the increased profitability of our existing facilities 
provision for income taxes of million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december   compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  the lower tax rate in resulted from revisions in estimates of various federal and state tax deductions made in connection with the preparation of our tax returns for net income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase of  or million  results primarily from the increased revenues and improved economies of scale related to expenses discussed above 
effective september  we sold our spanish operations 
as a result  our income statement reflects the historical results of our spanish operations in discontinued operations for both years 
in addition  our income statement reflects  in discontinued operations  the million gain on the sale of the spanish operations 
including the gain on the sale of our spanish operations  our net income increased from million in to million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by growth of our us same store facilities  which performed more surgical cases and received an average of approximately more per case in than in our same store uk facilities revenue excluding exchange rate fluctuations increased in additionally  revenues increased by million in due to our acquiring facilities or significantly increasing our ownership level in facilities we already operated  and by million due to the us dollar being weaker against the british pound in than in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of growth in case volumes and improved operating margins at our same store facilities 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  
table of contents operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to from  primarily as a result of increasing revenue base  operating efficiencies at our facilities and improved economies of scale as we expanded 
operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating income  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily as a result of improved operating margins at our facilities and the leveraging of our corporate overhead expenses over the increased revenue 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this amount increased due primarily as a result of depreciation of assets added through acquisitions and newly opened facilities 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to our increased revenue 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our borrowing a portion of the costs of acquiring and developing facilities 
other expense  net of other income increased more than million  to million of other income for the year ended december  from less than million of expense for the year ended december   primarily due to a nonrecurring gain in due to a favorable resolution of a contingency 
provision for income taxes was a net expense of million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december   compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our us operations  which have a slightly higher tax rate than our us operations  representing a larger percentage of overall pretax income in than in net income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this million improvement results primarily from the increased revenues and improved economies of scale related to expenses discussed above 
effective september  we sold our spanish operations 
as a result  our income statement reflects the historical results of our spanish operations in discontinued operations for both years 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated million of cash flows from operating activities as compared to million during and million during included in the million from is a benefit of million  which is not expected to recur  resulting from the collection of receivables in connection with our modifying contracts under which we provide certain administrative services to physicians  eliminating the financing of accounts receivable from the scope of services we provide 
a significant element of our cash flows from operating activities is the collection of accounts receivable 
collections efforts for accounts receivable are conducted primarily by our personnel at each facility or in centralized service centers for some metropolitan areas with multiple facilities 
these collection efforts are facilitated by our patient accounting system  which prompts individual account follow up through a series of phone calls and or collection letters written days after a procedure is billed and at day intervals thereafter 
bad debt reserves are established in increasing percentages by aging category based on historical collection experience 
generally  the entire amount of all accounts remaining uncollected days after the date of service are written off as bad debt and sent to an outside collection agency 
net amounts received from collection agencies are recorded as recoveries of bad debts 
during the year ended december   our net cash required for investing activities was million  consisting primarily of million for the purchase of businesses and million for the purchase of 
table of contents property and equipment  partially offset by after tax proceeds of million from the sale of our spanish operations 
the million primarily represents purchases of new businesses  net of cash received  and incremental investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the most significant of these transactions were million paid to acquire same day surgery  llc  which owns five surgical centers in chicago  illinois and to concurrently acquire a portion of the minority ownership interests in four of these facilities  million paid to acquire specialty surgicenters  inc  which operates four surgical centers  and to acquire a portion of the minority ownership interests in two of these facilities  million paid to acquire a controlling interest in a surgery center in san antonio  texas  million paid to acquire a controlling interest in a surgery center in reading  pennsylvania  million to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a surgical hospital and surgery center in oklahoma city  oklahoma  million paid to acquire a controlling interest in a surgery center in austintown  ohio  in which we had previously owned a noncontrolling interest  million to acquire additional ownership in a surgery center in los angeles  california  million paid to acquire a controlling interest in a surgery center in dallas  texas  in which we had previously owned a noncontrolling interest  and million of other transactions 
approximately million of the property and equipment purchases related to ongoing development projects  and the remaining million primarily represents purchases of equipment at existing facilities 
the million of cash used in investing activities was funded primarily with the proceeds of the sale of our spanish operations and the cash flows from operations noted above 
net cash used during the year ended december  by financing activities totaled million and resulted primarily from our investees scheduled principal repayments more than offsetting the amounts they borrowed to finance a portion of their capital expenditures 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared to million at december  and net working capital was million at december  as compared to million in the prior year 
the increases in cash and cash equivalents and in working capital from december  to december  were primarily due to the proceeds of the september sale of our spanish operations not being fully deployed by december  on september   we terminated our primary us revolving credit facility  under which no amounts were outstanding 
we initiated this termination in advance of the scheduled maturity date of november given our positive operating cash flows coupled with our receipt  after taxes  of approximately million in cash related to the sale of our spanish operations

at december   total outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement were approximately million which represents total borrowings net of scheduled repayments of million that have been made under the agreement  and approximately million was available for borrowing  primarily for capital projects specified in the agreement 
borrowings under the united kingdom credit facility bear interest at rates of to over libor and mature in april we pledged the capital stock of our uk subsidiaries to secure borrowings under the united kingdom credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit agreements as of december  
table of contents in october  we received  after offering costs of approximately million  net proceeds of approximately million from an offering of  shares of our common stock  which included  shares attributable to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
in december  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due we received net proceeds of million after offering costs of million and a discount of million 
the notes  which mature on december   accrue interest at payable semi annually on june and december commencing on june  and were issued at a discount of million  resulting in an effective interest rate of 
the senior subordinated notes are subordinate to all senior indebtedness and are guaranteed by uspi and uspi s wholly owned subsidiaries domiciled in the united states 
the company may redeem all or part of the notes on or after december  upon not less than nor more than days notice 
the redemption price would be the following percentages of principal amount  if redeemed during the month period commencing on december of the years set forth below period redemption price the company may also redeem the notes at any time prior to december   by paying the principal amount of all outstanding notes plus the greater of a of the principal amount or b the excess of the present value of the notes and all interest that would accrue through december  over the principal amount of the notes 
the company is obligated to offer to purchase the notes at of the principal amount upon the occurrence of certain change of control events 
in addition  the company is obligated to apply the proceeds of the sales of the spanish operations within one year to the company s operations or to repurchase the notes 
by december   we had already applied million of the spanish sale proceeds to the acquisition and development of surgical facilities  and we expect to apply the remaining million of proceeds to acquisitions  development  or other operations within the one year period 
any redemptions of the notes require payment of all amounts of accrued but unpaid interest 
our contractual cash obligations as of december  may be summarized as follows payments due by period within beyond contractual cash obligations total year years and years and years in thousands long term debt obligations principal plus interest senior subordinated notes uk credit facility other debt at operating subsidiaries capitalized lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations amounts shown for long term debt obligations and capital lease obligations include the associated interest 
for variable rate debt  the interest is calculated using the december  rates applicable to each debt instrument 

table of contents our operating subsidiaries  many of which have minority owners who share in the cash flow of these entities  have debt consisting primarily of capitalized lease obligations 
this debt is generally non recourse to uspi  the parent company  and is generally secured by the assets of those operating entities 
the total amount of these obligations  which was million at december   is included in our consolidated balance sheet because the borrower or obligated entity meets the requirements for consolidated financial reporting 
our average percentage ownership  weighted based on the individual subsidiary s amount of debt and capitalized leased obligations  of these consolidated subsidiaries was at december  additionally  our unconsolidated affiliates that we account for under the equity method have debt and capitalized lease obligations that are generally non recourse to uspi and are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   the total obligations of these unconsolidated affiliates under debt and capital lease obligations was approximately million 
our average percentage ownership  weighted based on the individual affiliate s amount of debt and capitalized lease obligations  of these unconsolidated affiliates was at december  uspi or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries had collectively guaranteed million of the million in total debt and capital lease obligations of our unconsolidated affiliates as of december  these unconsolidated affiliates are limited partnerships  limited liability partnerships or limited liability companies that own operational surgical facilities or surgical facilities that are under development 
none of these affiliates provide financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support for us 
they also do not engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services with us 
moreover  we do not believe that they expose us to any of their liabilities that are not otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we are not obligated to fund losses or otherwise provide additional funding to these affiliates other than as we determine to be economically required in order to successfully implement our development plans 
currently  uspi and its affiliates have five surgery centers and one private surgical hospital under construction and eleven additional surgery centers in the planning stage in the united states 
costs to develop a short stay surgical facility  which include construction  equipment and initial operating losses  vary depending on the range of specialties that will be undertaken at the facility 
our affiliates have budgeted an average of million for development costs for each of the five surgery center projects and approximately million for the surgical hospital project 
development costs are typically funded with approximately debt at the entity level with the remainder provided as equity from the owners of the entity 
we have made substantially all of the equity contributions to which we are obligated for four of these projects under construction and are obligated to invest an additional million for the other two projects under construction  but we may choose to invest additional funds in these or other projects in additionally  as each of these facilities becomes operational  each will have obligations associated with debt and capital lease arrangements 
our acquisition and development program will require substantial capital resources  which we estimate to range from million to million per year over the next three years 
during the first two months of  we paid approximately million to acquire  in individually immaterial transactions  additional ownership in nine facilities we already operated 
our acquisition and development activities primarily include the development of new facilities  buyups of additional ownership in facilities we already operate  and acquisitions of additional facilities 
these activities also include  in some cases  payments of additional purchase price to the sellers of acquired facilities based upon the resolution of certain contingencies or based upon acquired facilities achieving certain financial targets 
we currently estimate that we will pay approximately million related to these obligations 
of this amount  million  which is payable during  is based on contingencies that have been resolved and accordingly has been accrued as an increase to intangible assets and other accrued expenses in our december  balance sheet 
the remaining million represents our current estimate of amounts that may be payable in subsequent years and has not been accrued in our financial statements 
it is also possible we may have to pay the buyers of our spanish operations up to approximately million million plus interest related to a spanish tax contingency for which we indemnified the buyers  although we do not presently believe the likelihood of our making any such payment is probable  as discussed more fully in the notes to our financial statements 
in addition  the operations of our existing surgical facilities will require ongoing capital expenditures 
we believe that existing funds  cash flows 
table of contents from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  and borrowings under capital lease arrangements at newly developed or acquired facilities will provide sufficient liquidity for the next twelve months 
thereafter  we may require additional debt or equity financing for our acquisitions and development projects 
there are no assurances that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we will be required to curtail our acquisition and development program 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based payments using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and instead requires companies to recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the expense will be measured as the fair value of the award at its grant date based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest  and recorded over the applicable service period 
in the absence of an observable market price for a share based award  the fair value would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
the requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for our third quarter beginning july  and apply to all awards granted  modified or cancelled after that date 
the standard also provides for different transition methods for past award grants  including the restatement of prior period results 
we are finalizing our decision regarding which transition method we will elect to use and also are finalizing our determination of the exact amount by which the adoption of sfas no 
r will adversely impact our consolidated net income 
besides the effect of employee stock options  for which the historical pro forma impact is shown in note to the our financial statements  our net income may be adversely impacted by expense arising from our employee stock purchase plan espp  depending on the exact rules we have in place for our espp at the time sfas no

prior to the effective date of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
historically  we have not held or issued derivative financial instruments other than the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps for portions of our borrowings under credit facilities with commercial lenders as required by the credit agreements 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
our financing arrangements with commercial lenders are based on the spread over prime  libor or euribor 
at december   million of our total outstanding notes payable was the senior subordinated notes  which were issued in december at a discount and bear interest at a fixed rate of  million was in other fixed rate instruments and the remaining million was in variable rate instruments 
accordingly  a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would result in additional annual expense of million 
the senior subordinated notes  which represent of our total fixed rate debt at december   are considered to have a fair value  based upon recent trading  of million  which is approximately million higher than the carrying value at december  our united kingdom revenues are a significant portion of our total revenues 
we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally  including foreign currency exchange risk and taxes and regulatory changes 
our united kingdom operations operate in a natural hedge to a large extent because both expenses and revenues are denominated in local currency 
additionally  our borrowings and capital lease obligations in the united kingdom are currently denominated in local currency 
historically  the cash generated from our operations in the united kingdom has been utilized within that country to finance development and 
table of contents acquisition activity as well as for repayment of debt denominated in local currency 
accordingly  we have not generally utilized financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
in september  we sold our spanish operations 
by agreement with the buyer  we will not receive approximately million related to the sale until january in september  we entered into a forward contract with a currency broker to lock in the receipt of million in january  when we receive the euro denominated payment of million 
inflation and changing prices have not significantly affected our operating results or the markets in which we perform services
