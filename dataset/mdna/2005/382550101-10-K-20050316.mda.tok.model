item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the goodyear tire rubber company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires and rubber products with one of the most recognized brand names in the world 
we have a broad global footprint with manufacturing facilities in countries 
through december   our business was run through seven operating segments north american tire  european union tire  eastern europe  middle east and africa tire eastern europe tire formerly known as eastern europe  africa and middle east tire  latin american tire  asia pacific tire formerly known as asia tire  engineered products  and chemical products 
in  we had net income of million  compared to significant net losses for and of million as restated and  million as restated  respectively 
the net loss in included a non cash charge of billion as restated to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the improvement in compared to is due in part to a decrease in net after tax rationalization charges of million  an after tax gain from a settlement with certain insurance companies related to coverage for environmental matters of million  a decrease in net after tax charges for accelerated depreciation and asset writeoffs of million  a decrease in net after tax charges for general and product liability discontinued products of million as restated  and an increase in net favorable tax adjustments of million 
earnings in also benefited from an increase in segment operating income in each of our operating segments  as set forth below year ended december  restated in millions segment operating income north american tire european union tire eastern europe  middle east and africa tire latin american tire asia pacific tire engineered products chemical products in particular  our results are highly dependent upon the results of our north american tire segment  which accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in in recent years  north american tire results have been negatively impacted by several factors  including over capacity which limits pricing leverage  weakness in the replacement tire market  increased competition from low cost manufacturers  a decline in market share and increases in medical and pension costs 
in  north american tire s segment operating income improved to million on sales of approximately billion 
the improvement was due primarily to sustained improvement in pricing and a shift in product mix toward more profitable goodyear brand tires 
additional improvement was a result of savings from rationalization programs  lower benefit costs and increased sales in the consumer replacement market and commercial markets 
in addition  our second largest segment  european union tire  which accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in  had its segment operating income improve to million on sales of approximately billion 
approximately of the increase in segment operating income from to was attributable to 
table of contents currency translation  primarily the euro 
the improvement in european union tire also reflected improved pricing and product mix 
although our north american segment s performance improved in  it contributed just of our total segment operating income on of total segment sales  due primarily to legacy costs for north american retirees such as pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
in contrast  our latin american and eastern europe tire segments represented only of our total segment sales in  while approximately of our total segment operating income came from these segments 
as a result  increasing competition and unexpected changes in government policies or currency values in these regions could have a disproportionate impact on our ability to sustain profitability 
effective january   chemical products was integrated into north american tire 
the integration will not change how we report net income 
during  million  or  of chemical products sales and of its segment operating income resulted from intercompany transactions 
beginning with the first quarter of  our total segment sales will no longer reflect these intercompany sales 
in addition  the segment operating income previously attributable to chemical products intercompany transactions will no longer be included in the total segment operating income that we report 
higher raw material costs  particularly for natural rubber  continue to negatively impact our results 
raw material costs in our cost of goods sold in increased by approximately million from we expect that raw material costs will increase between and in compared to a key indicator of our operating performance is share of sales  especially in our two largest regions  north america and western europe 
listed below is our estimated share of sales in each of these two regions for our two primary tire markets original equipment and replacement 
north america western europe estimated share estimated share of sales of sales original equipment replacement the above percentages are estimates only and are based on a combination of industry publications and surveys and internal company surveys 
in north america  our share of sales in the replacement segment was comparable to our share in our share of sales in the replacement market increased for the goodyear brand while share of sales for the dunlop brand decreased 
our share of sales in the north american original equipment market channel declined compared to due to our selective fitment strategy in the consumer original equipment business 
in western europe  our share of replacement market sales decreased in all segments compared to oe market share increased in western europe due primarily to gains in the commercial market 
we continue to have a significant amount of debt 
on december   our debt including capital leases on a consolidated basis was billion  compared to billion at december  as a result of our increased debt level and higher average interest rates  our interest expense has continued to increase  reaching million in  compared to million in and million as restated in we anticipate undertaking refinancing activities in order to address billion and billion of long term debt maturing in and  respectively 
in addition  refinancing activities will address expected minimum required contributions to our domestic pension plans of approximately million to million in and million to million in  and the need to enhance our financial flexibility and ensure adequate liquidity 
in particular  our million european credit facilities mature on april  and must be either extended or refinanced 
as part of our refinancing efforts  we may seek to access the capital markets  although our current credit ratings may restrict our ability to do so 
failure to obtain new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
in addition  we continue to review potential asset sales 
we remain subject to a securities and exchange commission sec investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement of our historical financial statements 
we are cooperating fully 
table of contents with the sec and have provided requested information as expeditiously as possible 
because the sec investigation is currently ongoing  the outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
in may  following the conclusion of certain internal investigations initiated by our audit committee  our external auditors advised us that the circumstances they previously identified to us as collectively resulting in a material weakness in october had each individually become a material weakness 
our external auditors further identified an additional material weakness resulting from intentional overrides of internal controls by middle managerial personnel  particularly related to european union tire and workers compensation liability in the united states  which our internal investigation had identified and brought to the auditor s attention 
item a of this form k provides a discussion of remediation activities undertaken relative to these previously identified material weaknesses and management s conclusions as to their status of december  in addition  item a of this report discusses management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting under the sarbanes oxley act of that report concludes that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of december   and cites two material weaknesses in our internal controls 
management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm 
we are currently implementing a remediation plan to address these matters 
our results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be adversely affected in future periods by loss of market share or lower demand in the replacement market or from the original equipment industry  which would result in lower levels of plant utilization that would increase unit costs 
also  we could experience higher raw material and energy costs in future periods 
these costs  if incurred  may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in today s highly competitive market 
our future results of operations are also dependent on our ability to i successfully implement cost reduction programs to address  among other things  higher wage and benefit costs  and ii where necessary  reduce excess manufacturing capacity 
we are unable to predict future currency fluctuations 
sales and earnings in future periods would be unfavorably impacted if the us dollar strengthens against various foreign currencies  or if economic conditions deteriorate in the united states or europe 
continued volatile economic conditions or changes in government policies in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods 
we may also be impacted by economic disruptions associated with global events including war  acts of terror and civil obstructions 
results of operations consolidated all per share amounts are diluted net sales in were billion  compared to billion as restated in and billion as restated in net income of million  per share  was recorded in a net loss of million as restated  per share as restated  was recorded in a net loss of billion as restated  per share as restated  was recorded in  primarily resulting from a non cash charge of billion as restated  per share as restated to establish a valuation allowance against our net federal and state deferred tax assets 
net sales net sales in increased approximately billion from the increase was due primarily to the consolidation of two affiliates deemed to be variable interest entities  south pacific tyres spt and tire wheels assemblies t wa  in january the consolidation of these businesses increased net sales in by approximately billion 
additionally  improved pricing and product mix improvements in all sbus  primarily in north american tire  increased net sales by approximately million 
higher unit volume in north american tire  latin american tire  eastern europe tire and european union tire  as well as higher volume in engineered products and chemical products  had a favorable impact on net sales of approximately million 
currency translation  mainly in europe  favorably affected net sales by approximately million

interest expense interest expense in was million  compared to million in and million as restated in interest expense increased in from due to higher average debt levels  higher average interest rates and the april  restructuring and refinancing of our credit facilities 
interest expense increased in from as restated due to higher average debt levels 
while we expect interest expense to increase in due to higher interest rates and higher average debt levels  we expect that the billion refinancing we announced in february will partially offset this increase by reducing the amount over libor we pay to borrow under the refinanced facilities

net 
table of contents foreign currency exchange gain in as restated benefited by approximately million from currency movements on us dollar denominated monetary items in brazil 
a loss of approximately million resulting from currency movements on us dollar denominated monetary items in argentina was also recorded in equity in earnings losses of affiliates equity in earnings of affiliates in was income of million  compared to a loss of million as restated in and a loss of million as restated in the improvement in was due primarily to improved results at rubbernetwork 
com and the consolidation of south pacific tyres spt 
our share of losses at spt was included in and spt was consolidated effective january   pursuant to the provisions of fin income taxes for  we recorded tax expense of million on income before income taxes and minority interest in net income of subsidiaries of million

income tax expense in includes net favorable tax adjustments totaling million 
these adjustments related primarily to the settlement of prior years tax liabilities 
in  we determined that earnings of certain international subsidiaries would no longer be permanently reinvested in working capital 
accordingly  we recorded a provision of million for the incremental taxes incurred or to be incurred upon inclusion of such earnings in federal taxable income 
the american job creation act of the act was signed into law in october and replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income 
as we are both an exporter and a domestic manufacturer and in a us tax loss position  this change should have no material impact on our income tax provision 
the act also provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated no later than we have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision 
we do not anticipate that the repatriation of foreign earnings under the act would provide an overall tax benefit to us 
however  we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until our tax position has been more precisely determined and the us congress or the us treasury department provide additional guidance on certain of the act s provisions 
any repatriation of earnings under the act is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is probable that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
as of december   we had not recognized tax benefits of approximately million relating to the reorganization of legal entities in pursuant to the reorganization  our tax payments have been reduced by approximately million through december  should the ultimate outcome be unfavorable  we would be required to make a cash payment for all tax reductions claimed as of that date

if the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the estimated loss 
if the loss is estimated using a range and no point within the range is more probable than another  we record the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claim and were determined after review by our in house counsel  external counsel or a combination thereof 
court rulings on our cases or similar cases could impact our assessment of the probability and estimate of our loss  which could have an impact on our reported results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we record insurance recovery receivables related to our litigation claims when it is probable we will receive reimbursement from the insurer 
specifically  we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past  or in certain of our facilities 
typically  these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in state and federal courts 
due to the potential exposure that the asbestos claims represent  we began using an independent asbestos valuation firm in connection with the preparation of our financial statements 
the firm was engaged to review our existing reserves for pending claims  determine whether or not we could make a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims  and review our method of determining our receivables from probable insurance recoveries 
prior to the fourth quarter of  our estimate for asbestos liability was based upon a review of the various characteristics of the pending claims by an experienced asbestos counsel 
in addition  at that time we did not have an accrual for unasserted claims  as sufficient information was deemed to be not available to reliably estimate such an obligation prior to the fourth quarter of after reviewing our recent settlement history by jurisdiction  law firm  disease type and alleged date of first exposure  the valuation firm cited two primary reasons for us to refine our valuation assumptions 
first  in calculating our estimated liability  the valuation firm determined that we had previously assumed that we would resolve more claims in the foreseeable future than is likely based on our historical record and nationwide trends 
as a result  we now assume that a smaller percentage of pending claims will be resolved within the predictable future 
second  the valuation firm determined that it was not possible to estimate a liability for as many non malignancy claims as we had done in the past 
as a result  our current estimated liability includes fewer liabilities associated with non malignancy claims than were included prior to december a significant assumption in our estimated liability is that it represents our estimated liability through  which represents the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulties in making these estimates  analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future could result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated  and that increase could be significant 
we had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted claims  inclusive of defense costs  totaling million at december  and million as restated at december  the portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims was million at december  and million as restated at december  at december   our liability with respect to asserted claims and related defense costs was million  compared to million as restated at december  
table of contents we maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities 
we record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery 
prior to  we did not record a receivable for expected recoveries from excess carriers in respect of asbestos related matters 
we have instituted coverage actions against certain of these excess carriers 
after consultation with our outside legal counsel and giving consideration to relevant factors  including the ongoing legal proceedings with certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers  their financial viability  their legal obligations and other pertinent facts  we determined an amount we expect is probable of recovery from such carriers 
accordingly  we recorded a receivable during  which represents an estimate of recovery from our excess coverage insurance carriers relating to potential asbestos related liabilities 
the valuation firm also reviewed our method of valuing receivables recorded for probable insurance recoveries 
based upon the model employed by the valuation firm  as of december   i we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of million  compared to million as restated at december   and ii we expect that approximately of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable up to our accessible policy limits through the period covered by the estimated liability 
the receivable recorded consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers 
of this amount  million and million as restated was included in current assets as part of accounts and notes receivable at december  and  respectively 
in addition to our asbestos claims  we are a defendant in various lawsuits related to our entran ii rubber hose product 
during  we entered into a settlement agreement to address a substantial portion of our entran ii liabilities 
the claims associated with the plaintiffs that opted not to participate in the settlement will be evaluated in a manner consistent with our other litigation claims 
we had recorded liabilities related to entran ii claims totaling million at december  and million at december  environmental matters 
we had recorded liabilities totaling million at december  and million as restated at december  for anticipated costs related to various environmental matters  primarily the remediation of numerous waste disposal sites and certain properties sold by us 
our environmental liabilities are based upon our best estimate of the cost to remediate the identified locations 
our process for estimating the costs entails management selecting the best remediation alternative based upon either an internal analysis or third party studies and proposals 
our estimates are based upon the current law and approved remediation technology 
the actual cost that will be incurred may differ from these estimates based upon changes in environmental laws and standards  approval of new environmental remediation technology  and the extent to which other responsible parties ultimately contribute to the remediation efforts 
workers compensation 
we had recorded liabilities  on a discounted basis  totaling million and million as restated for anticipated costs related to workers compensation at december  and december   respectively 
the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience  and current cost trends 
the amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
we periodically update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses 
the increase in the liability from to was due primarily to an increase in reserves for existing claims  reflecting revised estimates of our ultimate liability in these cases  and updated actuarial assumptions related to unasserted claims 
at december   the liability was discounted using the risk free rate of return 
for further information on general and product liability and other litigation  environmental matters and workers compensation  refer to the note to the financial statements no 
 commitments and contingencies 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
generally accepted accounting principles do not permit goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be amortized 
rather  these assets must be tested annually for 
table of contents impairment 
the impairment testing would have to be performed more frequently than on an annual basis as a result of the occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment 
for purposes of our annual impairment testing  we determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units using a valuation methodology based upon an ebitda multiple using comparable companies in the global automotive industry sector and a discounted cash flow approach 
the ebitda multiple is adjusted if necessary to reflect local market conditions and recent transactions 
the ebitda of the reporting units are adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items and corporate charges 
ebitda is based upon a combination of historical and forecasted results 
significant decreases in ebitda in future periods could be an indication of a potential impairment 
additionally  valuation multiples in the global automotive industry sector would have to decline in excess of to indicate a potential goodwill impairment 
goodwill totaled million and other intangible assets totaled million at december  we completed our annual valuation during the third quarter of the valuation indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
at december   we had valuation allowances aggregating billion against all of our net federal and state and some of our foreign net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our us losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net federal and state deferred tax assets under sfas we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of such assets 
pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our recorded liability for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions is based on a number of assumptions  including future health care costs  maximum company covered benefit costs  life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  and future compensation levels 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of outside actuaries 
assumptions about future health care costs  life expectancies  retirement rates and future compensation levels are based on past experience and anticipated future trends  including an assumption about inflation 
the discount rate for our us plans is derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated aa or higher by s p 
the total cash flows provided by the portfolio are similar to the timing of our expected benefit payment cash flows 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our us pension fund over periods of years or more  asset class return expectations and long term inflation 
these assumptions are regularly reviewed and revised when appropriate  and changes in one or more of them could affect the amount of our recorded net expenses for these benefits 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods could be affected 
the discount rate used in determining the recorded liability for our us pension and postretirement plans was for  compared to for and for the decrease in the rate was due primarily to lower interest rates on long term highly rated corporate bonds 
as a result  interest cost included in our net periodic pension cost increased to million in  compared to million in and million in interest cost included in our net periodic postretirement cost was million in

 pensions  other postretirement benefits and savings plans 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents an estimate of the losses expected from our accounts and notes receivable portfolio 
the level of the allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors  including historical loss experience by region  portfolio duration  economic conditions and credit risk quality 
the adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly 
different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million as restated at december  and  respectively

financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was million in  compared to  million in and million in consolidated debt and our ratio of debt to debt and equity follows december  restated in millions consolidated debt debt to debt and equity consolidated debt increased in from primarily due to certain financing actions in including the completion of a million convertible senior notes offering as well as the termination of off balance sheet account receivable securitization programs in europe and the consolidation of vies as defined by fin consolidated debt increased in from due primarily to the april  restructuring and refinancing of our credit facilities  including the termination of our domestic off balance sheet accounts receivable securitization program 
credit sources we had available committed and uncommitted credit facilities totaling billion at december   of which billion were unused  compared to billion and million  respectively  at december  us deposit funded credit facility on august   we refinanced our then existing million us revolving credit facility with a us deposit funded credit facility  which is a synthetic revolving credit and letter of credit facility 
pursuant to the refinancing  the lenders deposited the entire million of the facility in an account held by the administrative agent  and those funds are used to support letters of credit or borrowings on a revolving basis  in each case subject to customary conditions 
the lenders under the new facility will receive annual compensation on the amount of the facility equivalent to basis points over libor  which includes commitment fees on the entire amount of the commitment whether drawn or undrawn and a usage fee on the amounts drawn 

table of contents the full amount of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit or for revolving loans 
the million of letters of credit that were outstanding under the us revolving credit facility as of june  were transferred to the deposit funded credit facility 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the facility and million of letters of credit issued under the facility 
the facility matures on september  our obligations under the deposit funded credit facility are guaranteed by most of our wholly owned us subsidiaries and by our wholly owned canadian subsidiary  goodyear canada inc our obligations under this facility and our subsidiaries obligations under the related guarantees are secured by collateral that includes subject to certain exceptions  perfected first priority security interests in the equity interests in our us subsidiaries and of the equity interests in our non european foreign subsidiaries  a perfected second priority security interest in of the capital stock of goodyear finance holding sa  a luxembourg company  perfected first priority security interests in and mortgages on our us corporate headquarters and certain of our us manufacturing facilities  perfected third priority security interests in all accounts receivable  inventory  cash and cash accounts pledged as security under our asset based facilities  and perfected first priority security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets  including equipment  contract rights and intellectual property 
the bond agreement for our swiss franc bonds due limits our ability to use our us tire and automotive parts manufacturing facilities as collateral for secured debt without triggering a requirement that holders of the bonds be secured on an equal and ratable basis 
the manufacturing facilities indicated above were pledged to ratably secure the bonds to the extent required by the bond agreement 
however  the aggregate amount of our debt secured by these manufacturing facilities is limited to of our positive consolidated shareholders equity 
consequently  the security interests granted to the lenders under the us senior secured funded credit facility are not required to be shared with the holders of debt outstanding under our other existing unsecured bond indentures 
the deposit funded credit facility contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional unsecured and secured indebtedness including a limit  subject to certain exceptions  of million in accounts receivable transactions  make investments and sell assets beyond specified limits 
the facility prohibits us from paying dividends on our common stock 
we must also maintain a minimum consolidated net worth as such term is defined in the deposit funded credit facility of at least billion for quarters ending in and the first quarter of  and billion for each quarter thereafter through september  we are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense to fall below a ratio of to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
in addition  our ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to consolidated ebitda is not permitted to be greater than to at any time 
the deposit funded credit facility also limits the amount of capital expenditures we may make to million in  and  and million in through september  
the amounts of permitted capital expenditures may be increased by the amount of net proceeds retained by us from permitted asset sales and equity and debt issuances 
in addition  unused capital expenditures may be carried over into the next year 
as a result of certain activities  the capital expenditure limit for was increased from million to approximately billion 
our capital expenditures for totaled million 
the capital expenditure carryover from was million  and in the absence of any other transactions  the limit for will be billion 

table of contents billion senior secured asset based credit facilities in april  we entered into senior secured asset based credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of billion  consisting of a million revolving credit facility and an million term loan facility 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million drawn against the term loan asset based facility  compared to million and million  respectively  at december  the facilities mature on march  on february   we added a million term loan tranche to the existing billion facility  which was fully drawn as of december  the million tranche was used partially to prepay our us term loan facility  to repay other indebtedness  and for general corporate purposes 
the facilities mature on march  we pay an annual commitment fee of basis points on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the revolving facility 
loans under the facilities other than the million term loan tranche bear interest at libor plus basis points or an alternative base rate the higher of jpmorgan s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points plus basis points 
the million term loan tranche bears interest at libor plus basis points or an alternative base rate plus basis points 
the basis points on the million term loan tranche decrease to and points  respectively  if the ratings of the tranche improve to at least b or better from moody s and b or better from standard poors 
a borrowing base equal to the sum of a percentage of certain accounts receivable and inventory limits availability under the facilities other than the million term loan tranche 
the calculation of the borrowing base and reserves against inventory and accounts receivable included in the borrowing base are subject to adjustment from time to time by the administrative agent and the majority lenders in their discretion not to be exercised unreasonably 
adjustments would be based on the results of ongoing collateral and borrowing base evaluations and appraisals 
a million availability block further limits availability under the facilities 
if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings under the facilities other than million term loan tranche exceeds the borrowing base  we are required to prepay borrowings sufficient to eliminate the excess or maintain compensating deposits with the agent bank 
the facilities are collateralized by first and second priority security interests in all accounts receivable and inventory of goodyear and its domestic and canadian subsidiaries excluding accounts receivable and inventory related to our north american joint venture with sri 
in addition  effective as of february   collateral included second and third priority security interests on the other assets securing the us facilities 
the facilities contain certain representations  warranties and covenants which are materially the same as those in the us facilities  with capital expenditures of million and million permitted in and through march  respectively 
in addition  we must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth of at least billion for quarters ending in and through march  
consolidated ebitda under our primary credit facilities  we are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense to fall below to as such terms are defined in each of the primary credit facilities for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
in addition  our ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as such terms are defined in each of the restructured credit facilities is not permitted to be greater than to at any time 
consolidated ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results  but rather as a measure of our ability to service debt 
it should not be construed as an alternative to either i income before income taxes  or ii cash flows from operating activities 
our failure to comply with the financial covenants in the primary credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
accordingly  management believes that the presentation of consolidated ebitda will provide investors with information needed to assess our ability to continue to comply with these covenants 
the following table presents the calculation of ebitda and consolidated ebitda for the periods indicated 
other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently than we do 
certain line items are presented as defined in the primary credit facilities  and do not reflect amounts as presented in the consolidated statement of income

million senior secured european facilities our joint venture in europe  goodyear dunlop tires europe bv and subsidiaries gdte is party to a million senior secured revolving credit facility and a million senior secured term loan facility 
these facilities mature on april  at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility and the secured term loan facility was fully drawn 
each of these facilities was fully drawn at december  gdte pays an annual commitment fee of basis points on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the european revolving facility 
gdte may obtain loans under the european facilities bearing interest at libor plus basis points or an alternative base rate the higher of jpmorgan s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points plus basis points 
the collateral pledged under the european facilities includes all of the capital stock of goodyear finance holding sa and certain subsidiaries of gdte  a perfected first priority interest in and mortgages on substantially all the tangible and intangible assets of gdte in the united kingdom  luxembourg  france and germany  including certain accounts receivable  inventory  real property  equipment  contract rights and cash and cash accounts  but excluding certain accounts receivable used in securitization programs  and with respect to the european revolving credit facility  a perfected fourth priority interest in and mortgages on the collateral pledged under the deposit funded credit facility and the asset based facilities  except for real estate other than our us corporate headquarters 

table of contents consistent with the covenants applicable to goodyear in the us facilities  the european facilities contain certain representations  warranties and covenants applicable to gdte and its subsidiaries which  among other things  limit gdte s ability to incur additional indebtedness including a limit of million in accounts receivable transactions  make investments  sell assets beyond specified limits  pay dividends  and make loans or advances to goodyear companies that are not subsidiaries of gdte 
the european facilities also contain certain additional covenants identical to those in the us facilities 
the european facilities also limit the amount of capital expenditures that gdte may make to million in and million in through april  
subject to the provisions in the european facilities and agreements with our joint venture partner  sumitomo rubber industries  ltd 
sri  gdte is permitted to transfer funds to goodyear 
these provisions and agreements include limitations on loans and advances from gdte to goodyear and a requirement that transactions with affiliates be consistent with past practices or on arms length terms 
any amount outstanding under the term facility is required to be prepaid with of the net cash proceeds of all sales and dispositions of assets by gdte and its subsidiaries greater than million  and of the net cash proceeds of debt and equity issuances by gdte and its subsidiaries 
the us and european facilities can be used  if necessary  to fund ordinary course of business needs  to repay maturing debt  and for other needs as they arise 
other foreign credit facilities at december   we had short term committed and uncommitted bank credit arrangements totaling million  of which million were unused  compared to million and million at december  the continued availability of these arrangements is at the discretion of the relevant lender  and a portion of these arrangements may be terminated at any time 
international accounts receivable securitization facilities on balance sheet financing on december   gdte and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new five year pan european accounts receivable securitization facility 
the facility initially provides million of funding  but has the ability to be expanded to million  and will be subject to customary annual renewal of back up liquidity lines 
the new facility replaces an million facility in a subsidiary in france 
the new facility involves the twice monthly sale of substantially all of the trade accounts receivable of certain gdte subsidiaries to a bankruptcy remote french company controlled by one of the liquidity banks in the facility 
these subsidiaries retained servicing responsibilities 
it is an event of default under the facility if the ratio of our consolidated ebitda to our consolidated interest expense falls below to  the ratio of our consolidated senior secured indebtedness to our consolidated ebitda is greater than to  the ratio of gdte s third party indebtedness net of cash held by gdte and its consolidated subsidiaries in excess of million to its consolidated ebitda is greater than to  or for so long as such a provision is in our european credit facilities  our consolidated net worth is less than billion on or prior to march   or is less than billion after march   in each case subject to a day grace period 

table of contents the financial covenants listed above will be automatically amended to conform to the european credit facilities upon the refinancing of the european credit facilities 
the defined terms used in the events of default tests are similar to those in the european credit facilities 
as of december   net cash inflows of million were recorded  representing the amount outstanding and fully utilized under this program 
the program did not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly  this amount is included in consolidated long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet 
net cash outflows of million were recorded in related to the termination of the replaced european accounts receivable securitization programs 
in addition to the pan european accounts receivable securitization facility discussed above  spt and other subsidiaries in australia had transferred accounts receivable under other programs totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
international accounts receivable securitization facilities off balance sheet financing various other international subsidiaries have also established accounts receivable continuous sales programs 
at december   proceeds available to these subsidiaries from the sale of certain of their receivables totaled million 
these subsidiaries retain servicing responsibilities 
million senior secured notes on march   we completed a private offering of million of senior secured notes  consisting of million of senior secured notes due and million of floating rate notes due  which accrue interest at libor plus 
the proceeds of the notes were used to prepay the remaining outstanding amount under the then existing us term loan facility  permanently reduce commitments under the then existing revolving credit facility by million  and for general corporate purposes 
the us term facility had been scheduled to mature in april loans under the retired term facility and the revolving credit facility each bore interest at libor plus 
the notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee the us deposit funded credit facility and asset based credit facilities 
the notes are secured by perfected fourth priority liens on the same collateral securing those facilities pari passu with the liens on that domestic collateral securing the parent guarantees of the european revolving credit facility 
we have the right to redeem the fixed rate notes in whole or in part from time to time on and after march  the redemption price  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  would be   and on and after march   and  respectively 
we may also redeem the fixed rate notes prior to march  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount plus a make whole premium 
we have the right to redeem the floating rate notes in whole or in part from time to time on and after march  the redemption price  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  would be   and on and after march   and  respectively 
in addition  prior to march   we have the right to redeem up to of the fixed and floating rate notes with net cash proceeds from one or more public equity offerings 
the redemption price would be for the fixed rate notes and plus the then applicable floating rate for the floating rate notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the indenture for the senior secured notes contains restrictions on our operations  including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness or liens  paying dividends  making distributions and stock repurchases  making investments  selling assets  and merging and consolidating 
the deposit funded credit facility also limits the amount of capital expenditures we may make to million in  and  and million in through september  
the amounts 
table of contents of permitted capital expenditures may be increased by the amount of net proceeds retained by us from permitted asset sales and equity and debt issuances 
in addition  unused capital expenditures may be carried over into the next year 
as a result of certain activities  the capital expenditure limit for was increased from million to approximately billion 
our capital expenditures for totaled million 
the capital expenditure carryover from was million  and in the absence of any other transactions  the limit for will be billion 
in the event that the senior secured notes have a rating equal to or greater than baa from moody s and bbb from standard and poor s  a number of those restrictions will not apply  for so long as those credit ratings are maintained 
million convertible note offering on july   we completed an offering of million of convertible senior notes due june  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock initially at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equal to an initial conversion price of per share 
the proceeds of the notes were used to repay temporarily a revolving credit facility and for working capital purposes 
million senior secured us term facility at march   all outstanding amounts under the facility were prepaid and the facility was retired 
at december   the balance due on the us term facility was million  due to a partial pay down of the balance during the second quarter of million senior secured us revolving credit facility at august   all outstanding amounts under the facility were prepaid and the facility was retired 
in addition  million of letters of credit issued under the facility were transferred to our million senior secured deposit funded credit facility 
registration obligations we are a party to two registration rights agreements in connection with our private placement of million of convertible notes in july and million of senior secured notes in march the registration rights agreement for the convertible notes requires us to pay additional interest to investors if we do not file a registration statement to register the convertible notes by november   or if such registration statement is not declared effective by the sec by december  the additional interest to investors is at a rate of per year for the first days and per year thereafter 
we failed to file a registration statement for the convertible notes by november   and as a result  will pay additional interest until such time as a registration statement is filed and declared effective 
the registration rights agreement for the senior secured notes requires us to pay additional interest to investors if a registered exchange offer for the notes is not completed by december  the additional interest to investors is at a rate of per year for the first days  increasing in increments of every days thereafter  to a maximum of per year 
because no such exchange offer was completed by december   we will pay additional interest until an exchange offer is completed 
if the rate of additional interest payable reaches per year then the interest rate for the secured notes will be permanently increased by per annum after the exchange offer is completed 

table of contents credit ratings our credit ratings as of the date of this report are presented below s p moody s senior secured asset based facilities bb b european facilities b b million asset based tranche b b million senior secured notes due b corporate rating b b implied senior unsecured debt b b private rating although we do not request ratings from fitch  the rating agency rates our secured debt facilities b and our unsecured debt ccc 
as a result of these ratings and other related events  we believe that our access to capital markets may be limited 
unless our debt credit ratings and operating performance improve  our access to the credit markets in the future may be limited 
moreover  a further reduction in our credit ratings would further increase the cost of any financing initiatives we may pursue 
a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency  and is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
any rating can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 
turnaround strategy we are currently implementing a turnaround strategy for north american tire that will require us to stabilize margins and market shares  simplify the sales and supply chain process  execute key cost cutting strategies  implement brand and distribution strategies  and grow the business through new product introductions and new sales channels 
our ability to successfully implement the cost cutting strategy is also dependent upon our ability to lower costs and increase productivity from levels achieved under the terms of our master contract with the uswa ratified in based in part on success in implementing the turnaround strategy  north american tire had stronger operating results in than in however  additional progress in implementing the turnaround strategy is needed to achieve a satisfactory level of profitability in north american tire 
if the goals of the turnaround strategy are not met  we will not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability  which would impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations and otherwise negatively affect our operations 
there is no assurance that we will successfully implement this turnaround strategy 
in particular  this strategy and our liquidity could be adversely affected by trends that affected the north american tire segment negatively in prior years  including industry overcapacity which limits pricing leverage  weakness in the replacement tire market  increased competition from low cost manufacturers and a related decline in our market share  weak us economic conditions  and increases in medical and pension costs 

table of contents in addition  the turnaround strategy has been  and may continue to be  impacted negatively by higher raw material and energy costs 
during  the market price of natural rubber  one of our most important raw materials  oil  an important feedstock for several other raw materials  increased significantly versus the prior year 
based on a combination of our inventory turns and raw material shipment lead times  market price fluctuations in raw materials typically impact our cgs three to six months subsequent to the raw material purchase date 
furthermore  market conditions may prevent us from passing these increases on to our customers through timely price increases 
we retained the blackstone group lp and bain company to provide consulting advice on the turnaround strategy and other possible strategic initiatives to maximize shareholder value 
future liquidity requirements at december   we had billion in cash and cash equivalents  of which billion was held in the united states and million was in accounts of gdte 
the remaining amounts were held in our other non us operations 
our ability to move cash and cash equivalents among our various operating locations is subject to the operating needs of the operating locations as well as restrictions imposed by local laws and applicable credit facility agreements 
at december   approximately million of cash was held in locations where significant tax or legal impediments would make it difficult or costly to execute monetary transfers 
unused availability under our various credit agreements totaled approximately billion at december  based upon our projected operating results  we expect that cash flow from operations  together with amounts available under our primary credit facilities and other sources of liquidity  will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements through december  including working capital  debt service  pension funding and capital expenditures 
the aggregate amount of long term debt maturing in calendar years and is approximately billion and billion  respectively 
included in the amount for is million related to our primary european credit facilities maturing on april  and our million euro notes due june equivalent to approximately million at december  
in march  billion related to our asset based facilities matures  and the million senior notes are due in december on february  we announced that we intend to refinance approximately billion of our credit facilities  including our billion asset based credit facility  due march   our million asset based term loan  due march   our million deposit funded credit facility  due september   and million in credit facilities for our goodyear dunlop tires europe bv affiliate  due april  we expect to replace these facilities with billion in new five year facilities that will be due in and include a billion asset based credit facility  a billion second lien term loan  and the euro equivalent of million in credit facilities for goodyear dunlop tires europe bv these transactions are subject to market conditions and the execution of definitive documentation and are expected to close in april we expect to record pretax charges of approximately million for the write off of unamortized costs related to the replaced facilities  and the costs of refinancing could be significant 
failure to refinance the european credit facilities or asset based facilities before they mature could have a material adverse affect on our liquidity 
in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed  we plan to seek additional financing in the capital markets 
because of our debt ratings  operating performance over the past few years and other factors  access to the capital markets cannot be assured 
our 
table of contents ongoing ability to access the capital markets is also dependent on the degree of success we have implementing our north american tire turnaround strategy 
successful implementation of the turnaround strategy is also crucial to ensuring that we have sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations 
while we made progress in implementing the turnaround strategy in  there is no assurance that our progress will continue  or that we will be able to sustain any future progress to a degree sufficient to maintain access to capital markets and meet liquidity requirements 
as a result  failure to complete the turnaround strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
future liquidity requirements also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt 
however  a substantial portion of our assets is already subject to liens securing our indebtedness 
as a result  we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 
in addition  unless we sustain or improve our financial performance  our ability to raise unsecured debt may be limited 
in addition to maturing debt  we are required to make contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plans 
these contributions are required under the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act erisa 
although subject to change  we expect to be required by erisa to make contributions to our domestic pension plans of approximately million to million in at the end of  the current interest rate relief measures used for pension funding calculations expire 
if current measures are extended  we estimate that required contributions in will be in the range of million to million 
if new legislation is not enacted  the interest rate used for and beyond will be based upon a year us treasury bond rate  as calculated and published by the us government as a proxy for the rate that could be attained if year treasury bonds were currently being issued 
using an estimate of these rates would result in estimated required contributions during in the range of million to million 
the assumptions used to develop these estimates are described in the commitments and contingencies table below 
we are not able to reasonably estimate our future required contributions beyond nevertheless  we expect that the amount of contributions required in years beyond will be substantial 
in  in addition to required domestic plan contributions  we expect to contribute approximately million to our funded international pension plans 
our postretirement benefit plans will require amounts to cover benefit payments in the future 
benefit payments are expected to be approximately million in  million in and million in these estimates are based upon the plan provisions currently in effect 
total payments are estimated to be approximately billion as calculated on december  the majority of these payments would be made more than five years hence 
the estimated payments do not include an estimated reduction in our obligations totaling approximately million to million resulting from the provisions of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of pursuant to an agreement entered into in  ansell ltd  our joint venture partner in south pacific tyres spt  has the right  subject to certain conditions  during the period beginning august and ending one year later  to require goodyear to purchase ansell s interest in spt 
the purchase price is a formula price based on the earnings of spt  subject to various adjustments 
if ansell does not exercise its right  we may require ansell to sell its interest to us during the days following the expiration of ansell s right at a price established using the same formula 
we are subject to various legal proceedings  including those described in the note to the financial statements no 
 commitments and contingent liabilities 
in the event we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any proceeding  we would be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court 
if we do not have sufficient availability under our facilities to issue a letter of credit to support an appeal bond  we may be required to i pay down borrowings under the facility in order to increase the amount available for issuing letters of credit  or ii deposit cash collateral in order to stay the enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal 
a significant deposit of cash collateral may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
a substantial portion of our borrowings is at variable rates of interest and exposes us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates rise  our debt service obligations would increase 
a significant rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity in future periods 

table of contents dividends on february   we announced that we eliminated our quarterly cash dividend 
the dividend reduction was decided on by the board of directors in order to conserve cash 
under our primary credit agreements  we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock 
commitments and contingencies contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of december  payment due by period as of december  after total st year nd year rd year th year th year years in millions long term debt capital lease obligations interest payments operating leases pension benefits other post retirement benefits workers compensation binding commitments long term debt payments include notes payable and reflect long term debt maturities as of december  the present value of capital lease obligations is million 
these amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements 
payments related to variable debt are based on the six month libor rate at december  plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented 
the amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt 
operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of million  million  million  million  million  and million in each of the periods above  respectively  for a total of million 
net operating lease payments total  million  with a present value of million 
the operating leases relate to  among other things  computers and office equipment  real estate and miscellaneous other assets 
no asset is leased from any related party 
the obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of december  the amounts set forth in the table represent our estimated minimum funding requirements in and for domestic defined pension plans under erisa  and million of expected contributions to our funded international pension plans in although subject to change  we expect to be required by erisa to make contributions to our domestic pension plans of approximately to million in the amount in the table for represents the midpoint of this range plus expected contributions to our funded international plans 
the expected contributions are based upon a number of assumptions  including an erisa liability interest rate of for  and plan asset returns of in at the end of  the current interest relief rate measures used for pension funding calculations expire 
if current measures are extended  we estimate that required contributions in will be in the range of million to million 
if new legislation is not enacted  the interest rate used for and beyond 
table of contents will be based upon a year us treasury bond rate  as calculated and published by the us government as a proxy for the rate that could be attained if year treasury bonds were currently being issued 
using an estimate of these rates would result in estimated required contributions during in the range of million to million 
the estimated amount set forth in the table for represents the mid point of this range 
we likely will be subject to additional statutory minimum funding requirements after we are not able to reasonably estimate our future required contributions beyond due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans  including interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns  what  if any  changes may occur in legislation  and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions 
we expect the amount of contributions required in years beyond will be substantial 
the payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect 
we reserve the right to modify or terminate the plans at any time 
the obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis 
the estimated payments do not include an estimated reduction in our obligations totaling approximately million to million resulting from the provisions of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the payments for workers compensation are based upon recent historical payment patterns 
the present value of anticipated payments for workers compensation is million 
binding commitments are for our normal operations and are related primarily to obligations to acquire land  buildings and equipment 
in addition  binding commitments includes obligations to purchase raw materials through short term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices 
we have recorded long term liabilities for other items including income taxes  general and product liabilities  environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities 
these other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature 
we cannot  with any degree of reliability  determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled 
accordingly  they are not included in the above table 
in addition  the following contingent contractual obligations  the amounts of which can not be estimated  are not included in the above table the terms and conditions of our global alliance with sri as set forth in the umbrella agreement between goodyear and sri provide for certain minority exit rights available to sri commencing in in addition  the occurrence of certain other events enumerated in the umbrella agreement  including certain bankruptcy events or changes in control of goodyear  could trigger a right of sri to require us to purchase these interests immediately 
sri s exit rights  in the unlikely event of exercise  could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sumitomo s interest in the alliance 
pursuant to an agreement entered into in  ansell ltd  our joint venture partner in south pacific tyres spt  has the right  subject to certain conditions  during the period beginning august and ending one year later  to require us to purchase ansell s interest in spt

the base prices are subject to quarterly adjustments for changes in raw material costs and natural gas costs and a one time adjustment for other manufacturing costs 
we do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts 
we generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term  intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices

off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  retained or held a contingent interest in transferred assets  undertaken an obligation under certain derivative instruments  or undertaken any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
we have entered into certain arrangements under which we have provided guarantees  as follows amount of commitment expiration per period total st year nd year rd year th year th year thereafter in millions customer financing guarantees affiliate financing guarantees other guarantees off balance sheet arrangements for further information about guarantees  refer to the note to the financial statements no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix 
within defined limitations  we manage the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
we will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates  and are normally designated as cash flow hedges 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates  and are normally designated as fair value hedges 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions 
at december   the interest rates on of our debt were fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate swap contracts  compared to at december  we also have from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances 
as a result of credit ratings actions and other related events  our access to these instruments may be limited

the sensitivity of our interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis 
the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases 
foreign currency exchange risk we enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment

in addition  the principal and interest on our swiss franc bonds due and million of the euro notes due are hedged by currency swap agreements 
contracts hedging the swiss franc bonds and the euro notes are designated as cash flow hedges 
contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation
