overview we provide employee internet management eim software products that enable organizations to analyze  report and manage how their employees use computing resources  including internet access  instant messaging im  peer to peer file sharing  network bandwidth and desktop applications 
our primary product offering is the websense enterprise software application  our central policy engine and management console 
websense enterprise gives organizations the ability to enhance security  improve employee productivity  conserve network bandwidth and mitigate potential legal liability by identifying potential risks and rapidly configuring and implementing policies to manage their employees internet access and use of software applications 
in  we released our first software product  websense internet screening system  and since that time  we have focused our business on developing and selling employee internet management solutions 
websense enterprise now serves as a platform for related websense add on modules  such as the premium groups  real time security updates  bandwidth optimizer  instant messaging im attachment manager  and client policy manager 
websense enterprise supports a variety of reporting options that allow organizations to document and analyze patterns of employees use of computing resources 
we currently derive all of our revenue from subscriptions to the websense enterprise solution including add on modules  and expect this trend to continue in the future as more offerings are added to the websense enterprise platform 
during  we derived of revenue from international sales compared with for  with the united kingdom comprising approximately of our total revenue in both years 
we believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity and we are continuing to expand our international operations  particularly in selected countries in the european  asia pacific and latin american markets 
we sell websense enterprise through both indirect and direct channels 
sales through indirect channels currently account for more than of our revenue  and our strategy is to continue to rely on indirect sales channels for a significant majority of our sales 
as described elsewhere in this report  we recognize revenue from subscriptions to websense enterprise  including add on modules  on a monthly straight line basis over the term of the subscription 
we recognize the operating expenses related to these sales as they are incurred 
these operating expenses include sales commissions  which are based on the total amount of the subscription contract and are fully expensed in the period the product is delivered 
operating expenses have continued to increase as compared with prior periods due to expanded selling and marketing efforts  continued product research and development and investments in administrative infrastructure to support subscription sales that we will recognize as revenue in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
when a purchase decision is made for websense enterprise  customers enter into a subscription agreement  which is generally  or months in duration and for a fixed number of users 
other services such as upgrades enhancements and standard post contract technical support services are sold together with websense enterprise and provided throughout the subscription term 
we recognize revenue on a monthly straight line basis  commencing with the month the subscription begins  over the term of the subscription agreement provided collectibility is reasonably assured 
upon entering into a subscription arrangement for a fixed or determinable fee  we electronically deliver access codes to users and then promptly invoice customers for the full amount of their subscriptions 
payment is due for the full term of the subscription  generally within days of the invoice 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
upon expiration of the subscription  customers who wish to re subscribe typically must do so at then current rates to continue using websense enterprise 
our revenue is significantly influenced by new and renewal subscriptions  and a decrease in subscription amounts could negatively impact our future revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to pay their invoice s 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
deferred tax assets 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
factors considered by us included our earnings history  projected earnings based on current operations  and projected future taxable income in excess of stock option deductions 
however  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged against income in the period such determination was made 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation of our deferred tax assets 
tax contingency reserve 
significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated income tax provision and evaluating our us and foreign tax positions 
it is our policy to maintain tax contingency reserves for tax audit issues that are likely to occur and can reasonably be estimated 
we review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits  additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues or rendering of court decisions affecting a particular tax issue 
tax reserve contingencies and changes to the reserves are evaluated and recorded in our tax provision in the period in which the above noted events occur 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods shown 
years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income years ended december  and revenue revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of the addition of new  renewed and upgraded subscriptions from our customers 
approximately of subscription revenue recognized in was derived from renewal business 
we expect total revenue growth amounts in to exceed total revenue growth in  although the percentage revenue growth rate may be lower in than in as a result of the increasing overall revenue base 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of the costs of content review  technical support and infrastructure costs associated with maintaining our databases 
cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with additional personnel in our technical support and database groups 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in the future as we support the growth and maintenance of our databases as well as the technical support needs of our customers 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue remained unchanged at during the years ended and we expect that cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  will remain below of revenue for the foreseeable future 
gross margin gross margin increased to million in from million in the increase was due to increased revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin remained unchanged at for the years ended and we expect that gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  will remain in excess of of revenue for the foreseeable future 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits related to personnel engaged in selling  marketing and customer support functions  along with costs related to public relations  advertising  promotions and travel as well as allocated facilities costs and depreciation expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in selling and marketing expenses of million was primarily due to increased headcount costs and related travel and allocated costs as well as higher commission and co op marketing expenses related to higher sales levels 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as more personnel are added to support our expanding selling and marketing efforts worldwide and as increased sales result in higher overall sales commission expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers  contract programmers  allocated facilities costs and equipment depreciation 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily a result of increased compensation costs as well as allocated costs to support our expanding list of technology partners  the enhancements of websense enterprise and additional products 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as a result of our continued enhancements of websense enterprise and additional products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for our executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  third party professional service fees and allocated facilities and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of an increase in professional accounting fees driven primarily by compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and allocated costs and additional personnel needed to support our growing operations 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods  reflecting growth in operations  increasing expenses associated with being a public company and expansion of our international operations 
we may also incur increased general and administrative expense in connection with our announced search for a chief executive officer to succeed mr 
carrington 
other income  net net other income decreased to million in from million in the decrease is due primarily to lower interest rates realized on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities despite increased balances as of december  as compared with december  the lower interest rates are substantially the result of our strategy beginning in the second quarter of to purchase lower interest tax exempt investments in order to maximize the after tax return on our investments 
also contributing to the decrease were realized losses from settled foreign currency forward contracts 
the majority of our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are tax exempt 
we expect the majority of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will continue to be held in tax exempt investments during the foreseeable future 
provision for income taxes in  united states and foreign income tax expense was million as compared to million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the annual effective tax rate for was lower than the effective tax rate primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal income tax rate  an increase in tax exempt interest income and an increase in federal and state research and development tax credits 
in and thereafter  we anticipate that our effective tax rate may decrease due to benefits derived from lower tax rates associated with foreign income 
years ended december  and revenue revenue increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily a result of the addition of new customers and increased sales to existing customers 
approximately of subscription revenue recognized in was derived from renewal business 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with additional personnel in our technical support and database groups 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue remained unchanged at during the years ended and gross margin gross margin increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin remained unchanged at during the years ended and operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in selling and marketing expenses of million was primarily due to increased headcount costs as well as increased commission expenses related to higher sales levels 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily a result of personnel added during to support our expanded list of technology partners  the enhancements of websense enterprise  including the development and launch of websense enterprise v  and additional products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to the addition of personnel to support our growing operations  both domestically and internationally 
amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation was not significant in and was million in the decrease in the amortization expense was primarily due to the accelerated method of amortization that we have applied since our initial public offering 
deferred stock based compensation was fully amortized as of december  other income  net net other income decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates realized on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities despite increased balances as of december  as compared with december  the lower interest rates were substantially the result of the lower interest rate environment combined with our strategy to maximize the after tax return on our investments by purchasing lower interest tax exempt investments beginning in the second quarter of as of december   the majority of our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were tax exempt  compared to no such investments at december  provision for income taxes in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  primarily attributable to the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the release of our valuation allowance offset these taxes as well as the provision for federal and california income taxes  which resulted in an effective net benefit rate of for during  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million  for an effective tax rate of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  investments in marketable securities of million and retained earnings of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to an increase in our net income and an increase in deferred revenue subscription amounts in excess of recognizable revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
our operating cash flow and revenue are significantly influenced by subscription renewals and a decrease in subscription renewals would negatively impact our operating cash flow and revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared with net cash used in investing activities of million in the million increase in cash used by investing activities in was primarily due to more purchases of marketable securities offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities 
net cash used by financing activities was million in compared with net cash used by financing activities of million in the million decrease in net cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to an increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options as well as the issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase program which offset the use of million in for the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
we have operating lease and software license commitments of approximately million in  million in  million in and million in a significant majority of our operating lease commitments are related to our corporate headquarters lease  which was renewed in april  and was most recently amended in july to add additional space for our corporate headquarters and to extend the lease through the lease renewal incentives resulted in no rent payments in the third and fourth quarters of and escalating rent payments from to the rent expense related to our corporate headquarters lease renewal is recorded monthly on a straight line basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
future minimum annual payments under non cancelable operating leases and software licenses at december  are as follows in thousands operating leases software licenses total as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
on april   we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
the repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions 
depending on market conditions and other factors  purchases under this program may be commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program  for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
summarized quarterly data unaudited the following tables present unaudited quarterly financial information for the eight quarters ended december  we believe this information reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the following information in addition to other information in this report before you decide to purchase our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently deem to be material and that we believe are specific to our company and our industry 
in addition to these risks  our business may be subject to risks currently unknown to us 
if any of these or other risks actually occurs  our business may be adversely affected  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
because we expect to derive a substantial portion of our future revenue from subscription fees for websense enterprise and related add on products  any failure of this product to satisfy customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance will seriously harm our business 
a substantial portion of our revenue comes from subscriptions to websense enterprise and its related premium groups and we expect this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  if for any reason revenue from websense enterprise or the add on products declines or does not grow as rapidly as we anticipate  our operating results and our business will be significantly impaired 
if websense enterprise or the add on products fail to meet the needs of our existing and target customers  or if they do not compare favorably in price and performance to competing products  our growth will be limited 
our future financial performance also will depend  in part  on our ability to diversify our offerings by successfully developing  introducing and gaining customer acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of websense enterprise  including add on application modules such as client policy manager  real time security updates  bandwidth optimizer and instant messaging attachment manager 
we may not be successful in achieving market acceptance of any new products that we develop or of enhanced versions of websense enterprise 
moreover  increased emphasis on the sale of our add on products could distract us from sales of our core websense enterprise offering  negatively impacting our overall sales 
any failure or delay in diversifying our existing offerings  or diversification at the detriment to our core websense enterprise offering  could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future success depends on our existing customers renewing and purchasing additional subscriptions to websense enterprise and the related add on products 
our future success depends on achieving substantial revenue from customer renewals for subscriptions to websense enterprise and the related add on products 
subscriptions for websense enterprise typically have durations of  or months 
our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions upon expiration 
we may be unable to generate significant revenue from renewals 
in order to maintain our revenue we must be successful in selling renewal subscriptions 
our future success also depends on our ability to sell further subscriptions to existing customers in order to add additional seats or product offerings within their respective organizations 
as a result  to increase our revenue we must sell our existing customers additional subscriptions for websense enterprise and the add on products to get greater coverage of their workforces 
this may require increasingly costly sales efforts targeting senior management and other management personnel associated with our customers internet infrastructure 
we face increasing competition  which places pressure on our pricing and which could prevent us from increasing revenue or maintaining profitability 
in addition  we may face competition from better established companies that have significantly greater resources 
the market for our products is intensely competitive and is likely to become even more so in the future 
our current principal competitors frequently offer their products at a significantly lower price than our products  which has resulted in pricing pressures on sales of our product and potentially could result in the commoditization of employee internet management  or eim  products 
we also face increasing competition from security solutions providers who may add eim modules or features to their product offerings 
if we are unable to maintain the current pricing on sales of our products or increase our pricing in the future  our profitability could be negatively impacted 
in addition  pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales  reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our current principal competitors include companies offering web filtering products  such as surfcontrol plc  secure computing  symantec corporation  cyberguard corporation  computer associates and trend micro  companies integrating web filtering into specialized security appliances  such as sonicwall  e technologies  blue coat systems and internet security systems  companies offering web security solutions  such as symantec corporation  and companies offering desktop security solutions such as microsoft corporation  cisco systems  internet security systems  and check point software 
we also face current and potential competition from vendors of internet servers  operating systems and networking hardware  many of which now  or may in the future  develop and or bundle eim or other competitive products with their products 
we compete against  and expect increased competition from  anti virus software developers  traditional network management software developers and web management service providers 
we may face new competition from companies offering quality of service solutions  such as packeteer  companies with a direct presence on computer desktops  such as microsoft  and companies offering desktop management solutions  such as altiris 
if eim functions become standard features of internet related hardware or software  the demand for our products will decrease 
furthermore  even if our products provide greater functionality and are more effective than certain other competitive products  potential customers might accept this limited functionality in lieu of purchasing our products 
in addition  our own indirect sales channels may decide to develop or sell competing products instead of our products 
many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages  such as greater name recognition and larger marketing budgets and resources  established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases  and substantially greater financial  technical and other resources 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
for all of the foregoing reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
sales to customers outside the united states have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue  and we expect this trend to continue  which exposes us to risks inherent in international sales 
we market and sell our products outside the united states through value added resellers  distributors and other resellers 
international sales represented approximately of our total revenue in and approximately in  and international sales increased in absolute dollars in compared with as a key component of our business strategy  we intend to expand our international sales  but success cannot be assured 
in addition to the risks associated with our domestic sales  our international sales are subject to the following risks dependence on foreign distributors and their sales channels  localization of our products and our ability to properly categorize and filter websites containing foreign languages  laws and business practices favoring local competitors  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  including tax laws and regulations  foreign currency fluctuations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties  and regional economic and political conditions 
such factors could have a material adverse effect on our future international sales 
any reduction in international sales  or our failure to further develop our international distribution channels  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our international revenue is currently denominated in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our products more expensive for international customers  which could harm our business 
beginning in  we anticipate billing certain international customers in foreign currencies 
this may increase our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates since we cannot be assured of receiving the same us dollar equivalent as when we bill exclusively in us dollars 
we engage in currency hedging activities with the intent of limiting the risk of exchange rate fluctuation 
if we fail to properly forecast rate fluctuations these activities could have a negative impact 
the market for our products continues to emerge  and if we are not successful in promoting awareness of the need for our products and of our websense brand  our growth may be limited 
based on our experience with potential customers  we believe that many corporations do not recognize or acknowledge the existence or scope of problems caused by misuse or abuse of the internet or of network computers 
in addition  there may be a time limited opportunity to achieve and maintain a significant share of the market for eim and our other products due in part to the emerging nature of these markets and the substantial resources available to our existing and potential competitors 
if employers do not recognize or acknowledge these problems  then the market for our products may develop more slowly than we expect  which could adversely affect our operating results 
developing and maintaining awareness of our websense brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products 
furthermore  we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops 
successful promotion of our websense brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to develop reliable and useful products at competitive prices 
if we fail to successfully promote our websense brand  or if our expenses to promote and maintain our websense brand are greater than anticipated  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our products ratably over the term of the subscription  downturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our revenue 
we expect that nearly all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will come from subscriptions to websense enterprise and add on application modules 
upon execution of a subscription agreement  we invoice our customers for the full term of the subscription agreement 
we then recognize revenue from customers monthly over the terms of their subscription agreements  which typically have durations of  or months 
as a result  a majority of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into and paid for during previous quarters 
because of this financial model  the revenue we report in any quarter or series of quarters may mask significant downturns in sales and the market acceptance of our products 
we may not be able to develop acceptable new products or enhancements to our existing products at a rate required by our rapidly changing market 
our future success depends on our ability to develop new products or enhancements to our existing products that keep pace with rapid technological developments and that address the changing needs of our customers 
although our products are designed to operate with a variety of network hardware and software platforms  we will need to continuously modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in internet related hardware  software  communication  browser and database technologies 
we may not be successful in either developing such products or timely introducing them to the market 
in addition  uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies  or modifications to existing platforms or technology could increase our research and development expenses 
the failure of our products to operate effectively with the existing and future network platforms and technologies will limit or reduce the market for our products  result in customer dissatisfaction and seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 
our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and development personnel 
we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our products and technologies 
we do not have employment agreements with a majority of our executive officers  key management or development personnel and  therefore  they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty 
in january  john carrington  our chief executive officer  and our board of directors initiated a succession process to identify a new chief executive officer for websense before january there is no deadline for this process and our intention is for mr 
carrington to retain his current role as chief executive officer until a successor is identified  and to retain his role as chairman of the board following the transition 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of one or more of our key employees could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in such an event we may be unable to recruit personnel to replace these individuals in a timely manner  or at all  on acceptable terms 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past  and will likely vary in the future primarily as the result of fluctuations in our billings  revenues and operating expenses 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future as we expand our selling and marketing activities  increase our research and development efforts and hire additional personnel 
in addition  our operating expenses historically have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate in the future  as the result of the factors described below and elsewhere in this quarterly report concentration of marketing expenses for activities such as trade shows and advertising campaigns  concentration of general and administrative expenses  such as recruiting expenses and professional services fees  concentration of research and development costs  and concentration of expenses associated with commissions paid on sales of subscriptions to our products 
as a result  our results of operations may not meet the expectations of current or potential investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock may decline 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control  including announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by our competitors  demand for our products  including fluctuations in subscription renewals  fluctuations in revenue from our indirect sales channels  changes in the pricing policies of our competitors  and changes in government regulations 
in addition  the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us  changes in our pricing policies  quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses  and our technological capabilities to accommodate the future growth in our operations or our customers 
further  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price of the stock of many internet related companies  and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
a number of publicly traded internet related companies have current market prices below their initial public offering prices 
market fluctuations such as these may seriously harm the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action suits have been filed following periods of market volatility in the price of a company s securities 
if such an action were instituted  we would incur substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which would seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we acquire any companies or technologies in the future  they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies  services and technologies in the future 
we have not made any acquisitions or investments to date  and therefore our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven 
although we review the records of companies or businesses we are interested in acquiring  even an in depth review may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its capabilities and deficiencies 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating operations  technologies  services and personnel  diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations  risk of entering new markets  potential loss of key employees  and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities  our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock 
as a result  if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments  our business and prospects may be seriously harmed 
we must develop and expand our indirect sales channels to increase revenue and improve our operating results 
we currently sell a significant majority of our products indirectly 
we intend to continue to rely on our indirect sales channels for a significant majority of revenue 
we depend on our indirect sales channels  including value added resellers  distributors  and providers of managed internet services  to offer our products to a larger customer base than can be reached through a direct sales effort 
we will need to expand our existing relationships and enter into new relationships to increase our current and future market share and revenue 
we may be unable to maintain and expand our existing relationships or enter into new relationships on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our existing relationships or enter into new relationships  we would lose customer introductions and co marketing benefits and our operating results could suffer 
our reliance on indirect sales channels could result in reduced revenue growth because we have little control over our value added resellers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
our indirect sales channels accounted for more than of our revenue in and we anticipate that sales from our various indirect sales channels  including value added resellers  distributors  providers of managed internet services and others  will continue to account for a significant majority of our total revenue in future periods 
none of these parties is obligated to continue selling our products or to make any purchases from us 
our ability to generate increased revenue depends significantly upon the ability and willingness of our indirect sales channels to market and sell our products to organizations worldwide 
if they are unsuccessful in their efforts or are unwilling or unable to market and sell our new product offerings such as client policy manager  real time security updates  bandwidth optimizer and im attachment manager  our operating results will suffer 
we cannot control the level of effort these parties expend or the extent to which any of them will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
some of our indirect sales channels also market and sell products that compete with our products or may decide to do so in the future 
we may not be able to prevent these parties from devoting greater resources to support our competitors products and or eliminating their efforts to sell our products 
any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and establish our websense brand 
intellectual property is critical to our success  and we rely upon trademark  copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our websense brand 
any of our trademarks may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
we currently have only two issued patents in the united states and one corresponding issued patent internationally  and we may be unable to obtain further patent protection in the future 
in addition  any issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages  or may be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available 
the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as united states laws  and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate 
as a result our means of protecting our proprietary technology and brands may not be adequate 
furthermore  despite our efforts  we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property  including the misappropriation or misuse of the content of our proprietary database of websites 
any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 
the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents  trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows 
our technologies and products may not be able to withstand any third party claims or rights against their use 
any intellectual property claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle  and could divert management attention from executing our business plan 
our database categories and our process for classifying websites and software applications within those categories are subjective  and we may not be able to categorize websites and software applications in accordance with our customers expectations 
we may not succeed in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our customers expectations 
we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases 
our customers may not agree with our determinations that particular websites and software applications should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases 
in addition  it is possible that our filtering processes may place objectionable material in categories that are generally unrestricted by our users internet and computer access policies  which could result in employees having access to such material in the workplace 
any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation 
furthermore  we select our categories based on content we believe employers want to manage 
we may not now  or in the future  succeed in properly identifying the categories of content that employers want to manage 
any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites and software applications according to our customers expectations will impair the growth of our business and our efforts to increase brand acceptance 
failure of our products to work properly could impact sales  increase costs  and create risks of potential negative publicity and legal liability 
because our products are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of complex network environments  they may have errors or defects that users identify after deployment  which could harm our reputation and our business 
in addition  products as complex as ours frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
we have from time to time found errors in versions of our products  and we may find such errors in the future 
the occurrence of errors could adversely affect sales of our products  divert the attention of engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
in addition  because customers rely on our products to manage employee behavior  any significant defects or errors in our products may result in negative publicity or legal claims 
negative publicity or legal claims could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the capability of our products to report internet data retrieval requests and software application execution requests along with the workstations from which they originated may result in negative publicity or legal claims based on potential privacy violations 
our databases may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet 
the success of our products depends on the breadth and accuracy of our databases 
although our databases currently catalog more than million websites and over  software applications and executable files  they contain only a portion of such material that exists 
in addition  the total number of websites and software applications is growing rapidly  and we expect this rapid growth rate to continue in the future 
our databases and database technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites and software applications  especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages 
further  the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality  features and reliability of our databases 
because our products primarily can only manage access to websites and software applications included in our databases  if our databases do not contain a meaningful portion of relevant content  the effectiveness of websense enterprise will be significantly diminished 
any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet will impair the market acceptance of our products  which in turn will harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our worldwide income tax provisions and other tax accruals may be insufficient if any taxing authorities assume taxing positions that are contrary to the company s positions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and for our accruals for other state  federal and international taxes such as sales and vat taxes 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany arrangements to share revenue and costs 
in such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing  which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities 
although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final exposure of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and other tax accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits  or other tax accruals  in the period in which such determination is made  and consequently  on our net income for such period 
from time to time  we are also audited by various state  federal and international authorities relating to tax matters 
we fully cooperate with all audits  but defend our positions vigorously 
our audits are in various stages of completion  however  no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit and appeals process 
as each audit is concluded  adjustments  if any  are appropriately recorded in our financial statements in the period determined 
to provide for potential tax exposures  we maintain allowances for tax contingencies based on reasonable estimates of our potential exposure with respect to the tax liabilities that may result from such audits 
however  if the reserves are insufficient upon completion of any audits  there could be an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to changes in financial accounting standards  which may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct business 
accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition have been the subject of frequent interpretations  significantly affecting the way we sell our products 
future changes in financial accounting standards  including pronouncements relating to revenue recognition  may have a significant effect on our reported results  including reporting of transactions completed before the effective date of the changes 
in december  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which will be effective in our third quarter of fiscal sfas r will result in our recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
under this standard  we generally do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we issue under our stock option plans or the discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plans 
under the new rules  we are required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards  this will lead to substantial additional compensation expense 
this change will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
note to our consolidated financial statements in this report provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during fiscal  and in addition  the adoption of this standard could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool  which could  in turn  hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees 
our systems may be vulnerable to security risks or service disruptions that could harm our business 
although we have taken measures to secure our systems against security risks and other causes of disruption of electronic services  our servers are vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins and service disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to process customer requests 
such events could be very expensive to remedy  could damage our reputation and could discourage existing and potential customers from using our products 
evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely 
as internet commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal  state or foreign agencies becomes more likely 
such regulation is likely in the areas of user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services 
taxation of internet use or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed 
laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection or processing of personal or consumer information could affect our activities 
furthermore  any regulation imposing fees for internet use could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet commerce  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our growth could strain our personnel and infrastructure resources  and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth  we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 
we continue to experience rapid growth in our operations  which has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively 
this will require us to hire and train additional personnel to manage our expanding operations 
in addition  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures 
if we fail to successfully manage our growth  we will be unable to execute our business plan 
because competition for our target employees is intense  we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 
to execute our growth plan  we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
we need to hire additional personnel in virtually all operational areas  including selling and marketing  research and development  operations and technical support  customer service and administration 
competition for these personnel is intense  especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet related products 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have 
if we fail to attract new personnel or retain and motivate our current personnel  our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as some provisions of delaware law  may discourage  delay or prevent third parties from acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board  with each board member serving a staggered three year term 
it also provides that stockholders may not fill board vacancies  call stockholder meetings or act by written consent 
our bylaws further provide that advance written notice is required prior to stockholder proposals 
each of these provisions makes it more difficult for stockholders to obtain control of our board or initiate actions that are opposed by the then current board 
additionally  we have authorized preferred stock that is undesignated  making it possible for the board to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights and preferences that could impede the success of any attempted change of control 
delaware law also could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
section of the delaware general corporation law may have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of the shares of common stock held by our stockholders 
we do not intend to pay dividends 
we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since we have been a publicly traded company 
we currently intend to retain any future cash flows from operations to fund growth and  do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments  municipal securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  changes in interest rates over time will  however  affect our interest income 
for the year ended december   all of our billings  including those billed by our operations in ireland  were denominated in our functional currency  which is the us dollar 
working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries are kept in the local currencies in which they do business 
beginning in  we anticipate billing certain international customers in foreign currencies  however we do not expect the foreign currency billings to represent more than of our total billings during we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets and liabilities 
our objective is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had committed to six foreign currency forward contracts to purchase euro and british pounds for million 
our euro commitment represents  euros at a weighted average forward rate of 
our british pound commitment represents  british pounds at a weighted average forward rate of 
the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts was million at december  all of the foreign currency forward contracts will be settled before march
