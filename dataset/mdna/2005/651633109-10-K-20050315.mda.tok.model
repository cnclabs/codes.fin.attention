application of critical accounting policies newmil s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and follow general practices within the banking industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
newmil s significant accounting policies are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in notes to consolidated financial statements and in management s discussion and analysis  provide information on how significant assets are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the balance sheet 
note describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the provision and allowance for loan losses section of management s discussion and analysis 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is regularly evaluated for impairment  in which case its carrying value would be reduced through a charge to earnings for any impairment 
core deposit and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are also regularly evaluated for impairment 
the valuation techniques used to determine the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in acquisitions and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates  which are used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations

during the period from to an improving economic climate and prudent credit risk management resulted in a significant decline in net charge offs  as compared with the period from to  during which time many of newmil s borrowers experienced financial difficulties 
in newmil s net charge offs were  compared to  for and  for and  for during the preceding six and one half fiscal years  from through  net charge offs averaged  annually adjusted for a  net recovery during the six months ended december  as compared to  annually for fiscal years through due to the large losses and high level of non performing assets through and as of june  the allowance for loan losses at that date was  over the next six years the provision was  less than charge offs 
in  through net charge offs were  and there was no provision for loan losses 
the following table provides a comparison of allowance for loan losses and non performing assets data for and with historical data from     and  which demonstrates the wide range in levels of non performing assets and net charge offs over these periods 
december  june  dollars in thousands loans  net allowance for loan losses non performing assets non performing loans ratios of allowance to gross loans non performing assets to gross loans although newmil achieved loan growth  before allowance and deferred fees costs  of million  newmil made no provision for loan losses during loan growth was concentrated primarily in family residential mortgages  commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans  net charge offs as a percent of average loans were negligible  and non performing loans remained stable and at a historically low level 
consequently  for the ratio of newmil s allowance for loan losses to total loans declined to from at december   at december   at december  and at june  similarly  newmil s ratio of non performing loans to total gross loans continued to remain historically low  and actually declined to at december   compared to at december   at december   at december  and at june  the ratio of past due loans including non performing loans to total loans declined to at december  when compared with at december  and at december  the ratio of past due loans was at december  and at june  for additional discussion on loan quality see non performing assets 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the broad categories of the loan portfolio and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans 
although the allowance has been allocated among loan categories for purposes of the table  it is important to recognize that the allowance is applicable to the entire portfolio 
furthermore  charge offs in the future may not necessarily occur in these amounts or proportions

newmil determines its allowance and provisions for loan losses based upon a detailed evaluation of the loan portfolio through a process which considers numerous factors  including estimated credit losses based upon internal and external portfolio reviews  delinquency levels and trends  estimates of the current value of underlying collateral  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in lending policy  current economic conditions and historical loan loss experience over a to year economic cycle 
determining the level of the allowance at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods  and therefore management takes a relatively long view of loan loss asset quality measures 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information that are often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in the light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in management s judgment newmil remains adequately reserved both against total loans and non performing loans at december  the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved by the bank s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the allowance for loan losses is computed by segregating the portfolio into various risk rating and product categories 
some loans have been further segregated and carry specific reserve amounts 
all other loans that do not have specific reserves assigned are reserved based on a loss percentage assigned to the outstanding balance 
the percentage applied to the outstanding balance varies depending on the loan s risk rating and product category  as well as present economic conditions  which have or may adversely affect the financial capacity and or collateral values supporting the loan 
during management refined its distribution process for allocating reserves 
this refinement resulted in an increased distribution of reserves to those portions of the portfolio from that which was previously categorized as general unallocated 
due to favorable market demand conditions and commercial collateral valuation growth arising from regional economic activities during and  management updated its valuations of loan reserves in  factored with improved credit quality of criticized and classified loans resulted in an increase in the general unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses at december  management also determined  based on its review of all components of the bank s loan portfolio  economic data  industry trends and other factors  that the remaining general unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december  in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies could require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank was examined by the state of connecticut s department of banking in july and the fdic in july and no additions to the allowance were requested as a result of these examinations 
non interest income non interest income increased  in  due primarily to an increase in deposit account service charge revenues precipitated by internal growth 
the principal categories of non interest income are as follows years ended december  dollars in thousands change service charges on deposit accounts gains on sales of loans  net loan servicing increase in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance other total non interest income the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in reflects increased transaction volume resulting from growth in transaction deposit accounts and an increase in the fee schedule during the period 
during gains from sales of residential mortgage loans decreased by  due to decreased loan sales  million in compared with million in loans originated for sale are pre arranged on an individual loan basis at commitment and are sold servicing released 
the decrease in loan servicing fees in results from portfolio run off 
newmil did not acquire any loan servicing assets during the decline in the increase in the cash surrender values of bank owned life insurance was due to the effects of lower market interest rates during as compared with the decrease in other non interest income in was primarily due to lower commissions received on official checks and money orders 
the bank began clearing its own official checks and money orders in house in this has the effect of replacing commission income with an increase in deposit balances 
operating expenses operating expenses increased  in the principal categories of operating expenses are as follows years ended december  dollars in thousands change salaries employee benefits occupancy equipment marketing professional  collection and oreo amortization of intangible assets other operating total operating expenses the increase in salaries expense in was primarily due to year over year salary increases and lower deferred loan origination expense attributable to lower loan origination activity  offset somewhat by decreased residential mortgage commissions expense and a lower accrued bonus expense

also contributing were lower costs related to health benefits primarily attributable to a lesser number of employees covered during the period and a decrease in payroll taxes offset somewhat by higher supplemental retirement costs and slightly higher employee k contributions due to an increase in the number of participants in the period 
the decrease in occupancy expense was due to mostly to a decrease in building maintenance and repairs  offset partially by increased rent  utilities and other occupancy costs 
equipment expense decreased due to a decline in computer hardware  software  furniture and equipment depreciation expense during the period  offset somewhat by higher maintenance contracts on equipment and computer hardware and software 
marketing expense increased as a result of higher deposit advertising campaigns during professional fees decreased during due primarily to a decline in consulting engagements from the period that included cost control and fee income initiatives that exceeded increases related to audit  accounting expense  legal and other professional collection costs 
the decline in amortization expense for intangible assets was due to lower scheduled amortization of core deposit intangibles arising from the nutmeg acquisition in november the increase in other operating expense was due to a greater extent to costs related from printing  telecommunications  atm expense  franchise taxes and to increases in various other operating expense line items

the factors contributing to deposit growth in and began to abate in  as the equity markets staged a strong recovery and the availability of other investment alternatives with higher perceived future returns increased 
deposit growth in and was partially fueled by the negative returns in the equities markets resulting in an outflow of funds from the equities markets and into the banking system 
this event temporarily reversed the disintermediation process that prevailed during the long bull market  and newmil benefited from this shift 
also contributing to newmil s deposit growth in and and an increase in its market share was its nutmeg acquisition november and deposit run off at adjacent competitor branches operated by large regional multi state banks involved in bank acquisitions

the junior subordinated debentures  which are the sole assets of the trust  are unsecured obligations of newmil and generally are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all present and future senior and subordinated indebtedness and certain other financial obligations of newmil 
the trust preferred securities have an original term of years and bear a fixed coupon of for the first five years  and thereafter  a floating rate coupon that will reset quarterly at three month libor plus 
interest on the securities is payable quarterly 
newmil may redeem the trust preferred securities  in whole or in part  on or after march   or earlier under certain conditions 
the subordinated debentures bear the same terms and conditions as the trust preferred securities 
newmil paid  in connection with the issuance of the trust preferred securities and this amount is being amortized over the estimated life of the underlying securities 
the net proceeds qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual cash obligations in the normal course of business  newmil enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
contractual obligations at december   include long term debt  operating leases  contractual purchases and certain pension and other benefit plans 
for a further discussion regarding operating leases see note the accompanying table summarizes newmil s off balance sheet lending related financial instruments and significant cash obligations  by remaining maturity  at december  newmil s lending related financial instruments include commitments that have maturities over one year 
those commitments maturities are estimated to mature over a five year period 
contractual purchases include commitments for future cash expenditures  primarily for services and contracts that reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable 
excluded from the following table are a number of obligations to be settled in cash  primarily in under one year 
these obligations are reflected in newmil s consolidated balance sheet and include deposits  federal home loan bank borrowings and repurchase agreements that settle within standard market timeframes

at december   newmil s liquidity ratio  as represented by cash  short term available for sale securities  marketable assets  the ability to borrow against held to maturity securities and loans through unused fhlb and other short term borrowing capacity  of approximately million  to net deposits and short term unsecured liabilities  was  well in excess of newmil s minimum policy guideline of 
at december   newmil had outstanding commitments to fund new loan originations of million  construction mortgage commitments of million and unused lines of credit of million 
these commitments can be met in the normal course of business 
newmil believes that its liquidity sources will continue to provide funding sufficient to support operating activities  loan originations and commitments  and deposit withdrawals 
asset liability management and market risk newmil is exposed to interest rate risk  caused by changes in interest rates  affecting its loans  securities  deposits and borrowings 
newmil has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  market risk or equity price risk 
newmil s asset liability committee and investment committee of the board of directors are responsible for the financial management of net interest income  liquidity  capital and other such activities 
the primary objective of newmil s interest rate risk management process is to minimize the volatility to earnings from changes in interest rates 
newmil manages interest rate risk by structuring its balance sheet to attempt to maximize overall profitability  increase revenue  and achieve the desired level of net interest income while managing interest sensitivity risk and liquidity 
newmil manages interest rate risk within limits approved by the board of directors using an earnings simulation model that simulates earnings over a specified time horizon to measure the amount of short term earnings at risk under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
newmil also uses balance sheet gap analysis to measure and monitor its short  medium and long term interest rate positions or exposures 
newmil s earnings simulation analysis incorporates numerous assumptions about balance sheet changes  including growth and product mix  prepayments  product pricing and the behavior of interest rates 
earnings simulation modeling includes assumptions that are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions  and management s strategies  among other factors 
its purpose is to provide management with a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
newmil s policy guideline seeks to ensure that changes in net income over a twelve month horizon under interest rate scenarios that incorporate a and basis point change in the overnight federal funds rate will not exceed and  respectively  as compared with the current overnight federal funds rate scenario 
should earnings simulation amounts deviate by more than these limits  management is required to take remedial action 
newmil tailors its earnings simulation test scenarios to suit current market conditions and interest rate expectations 
because december  interest rates were at historically low levels  newmil performed earnings simulations to test for an immediate basis point and basis point change in the overnight federal funds rate and a gradually rising basis point change in the overnight federal funds rate over the forecast horizon 
based on the results of the december  earnings simulation model and assuming that management does not take action to alter the outcome  newmil would expect net income over the next twelve months to decrease by if the overnight federal funds rate decreased immediately by basis points  and decrease by if the overnight federal funds rate increased immediately by basis points  and decrease by if the overnight federal funds rate increased gradually by basis points as compared with the results of the no change in rates base case forecast over the next twelve months 
due to the numerous assumptions in the simulation analysis  actual results will differ from estimated results 
factors other than changes in interest rates could also impact net income 
a significant factor in determining newmil s ability to maintain its net interest margin in a changing interest rate environment is its ability to manage its core deposit rates 
essentially all newmil s deposit base is composed of local retail deposit accounts that tend to be somewhat less sensitive to moderate interest fluctuations than other funding sources and  therefore  provide a reasonably stable and cost effective source of funds 
the entry of new competitors into newmil s market area or renewed disintermediation of deposits fueled by a resurgence in the equities markets may pressure newmil to change its loan and deposit pricing which may negatively affect newmil s net interest margin 
newmil structures its loan and securities portfolios to provide for portfolio re pricing consistent with its interest rate risk objectives 
the following table sets forth newmil s gap position at december   measured in terms of the volume of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities that are subject to re pricing in future time periods 
for the purposes of this analysis  money market and savings deposits have been presented in the within month category and now account deposits have been presented in the after year category  although the interest rate elasticity of money market  savings and now deposits cannot be tied to any one time category 
non accrual loans and overdrafts have been presented in the non interest bearing category 
significant variations may exist in the degree of interest rate sensitivity between individual asset and liability types within the re pricing periods presented due to differences in their re pricing elasticity relative to changes in the general level of interest rates 
december  within within non dollars in thousands within after interest months months years years bearing total assets securities cash due from banks loans  net other assets total assets source of funds deposits demand non interest bearing now accounts money market savings other certificates of deposit federal home loan bank advances repurchase agreements long term debt other liabilities stockholders equity total sources of funds cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap percent of total assets at december   newmil s one year cumulative gap was liability sensitive  amounting to million  or of assets 
a liability sensitive gap implies that newmil s net interest margin could be adversely affected by a sudden increase in interest rates 
capital resources during shareholders equity increased million  or  to million  while book value per share increased from at december  to at december  the increase in shareholders equity resulted from net income of million  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and a  tax benefit from the exercise of non qualified stock options  offset  in part  by dividend payments of million  net unrealized losses of million on securities available for sale  net of taxes  and treasury stock purchases of million 
repurchases of common stock on april   newmil announced its intention to repurchase  or  of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market and unsolicited negotiated transactions  including block purchases 
the purpose of newmil s repurchase plan is to offset the future dilution from shares issued upon the exercise of stock options under newmil s stock option plans  and for general corporate purposes 
during newmil repurchased  shares of common stock for total consideration of million  or per average share under the share repurchase plan announced on april  capital requirements newmil and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements established  respectively  by the federal reserve board the frb and the fdic 
at december   newmil s leverage capital ratio was and its tier i and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively 
at december   the bank s leverage capital  and tier i and total risk based capital ratios were  and  respectively 
at december   the bank s leverage capital  and tier i and total risk based capital ratios were  and  respectively 
newmil and the bank are categorized as well capitalized 
a well capitalized institution  which is the highest capital category for an institution as defined by the prompt corrective action regulations issued by the fdic and the frb  is one which maintains a total risk based ratio of or above  a tier risk based ratio of or above and a tier leverage ratio of or above  and is not subject to any written order  written agreement  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
dividend restrictions in april newmil increased its quarterly dividend payment to per share 
during the years ended december  and total dividends of and per share  respectively  were paid 
newmil believes that the payment of cash dividends to its shareholders is appropriate  provided that such payment considers newmil s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of newmil or the bank 
the continued payment of cash dividends by newmil will be dependent on newmil s future core earnings  financial condition and capital needs  regulatory restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors of newmil 
newmil s ability to pay dividends is dependent on the bank s ability to pay dividends to newmil 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and other payments by the bank to newmil 
under connecticut law the bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on its common stock except from its net profit for the current year and retained net profits for the preceding two years 
consequently  the maximum amount of dividends payable by the bank to newmil at december  was million 
in some instances further restrictions on dividends may be imposed on newmil by the federal reserve bank 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements on march   the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
application of accounting principles to loan commitments sab 
sab summarizes the views of the sec staff regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments 
the sec staff believes that in recognizing a loan commitment  entities should not consider expected future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan until the servicing asset has been contractually separated from the underlying loan by sale or securitization of the loan with the servicing retained 
the provisions of sab are applicable to all loan commitments accounted for as derivatives and entered into subsequent to march  the adoption of this staff accounting bulletin did not have a material impact on results of operations  financial position  or liquidity of newmil 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 share based payment 
the statement requires entities to measure the cost of employees services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
however  no compensation expense is recognized for equity instruments that do not vest 
the estimated grant date fair value of employee share options must be determined using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
the notes to the financial statements will include additional disclosures to assist users of the financial statements in understanding the nature of share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
the effective date of the statement for newmil is july  all public entities will be required to apply the statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under statement for either recognition or proforma disclosure purposes 
under the stock option plans currently in place at newmil  and assuming similar amounts of options are granted to directors as in prior years and that no options are granted to employees  since no option grants are contemplated  and using the current valuation assumptions with respect to the dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected lives  newmil expects the impact of this statement to have no effect on net income for and to reduce net income by approximately  or per share  for and thereafter 
in december  a bill was signed into law that expands medicare benefits  primarily adding a prescription drug benefit for medicare eligible retirees beginning in the law also provides a federal subsidy to companies that sponsor post retirement benefit plans that provide prescription drug coverage 
in may  fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of was issued which provides accounting guidance on implementing the effects of the act 
newmil s postretirement benefit plan does provide prescription drug benefits 
newmil has reviewed the prescription drug benefits provided under its postretirement benefit plan and has determined that such benefits are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d under the act  however  based on the limited number of retirees eligible for the plan and the limited prescription drug benefits paid  by the plan  the costs of qualifying for the subsidy will exceed the benefit provided by the subsidy 
therefore  the provisions of fsp are expected to have no impact on the financial statements of newmil and  accordingly  the apbo and net periodic postretirement benefit cost included in its financial statements do not reflect the effects of the act on the company s postretirement benefits plan 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  determining the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under sfas including individual securities and investments in mutual funds and to investments accounted for under the cost method 
the provisions of this eitf were originally effective for reporting periods beginning after june  however  on october   the fasb issued staff position no 
eitf  deferring the effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue the delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairment as required by existing authoritative literature 
newmil adopted the disclosure requirements of eitf as of december   which were not affected by staff position newmil does not believe that the application of the recognition guidance in paragraphs of eitf issue will have a material impact on newmil s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices newmil s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate 
sharp decreases in real estate prices have  in past years  resulted in significant loan losses and losses on real estate acquired 
inflation  or disinflation  could significantly affect newmil s earnings in future periods
