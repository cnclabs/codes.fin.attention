the company has embarked on a growth strategy that encompasses acquisitions  the reduction of risk associated with certain large customer concentrations and the enhancement of cross selling of its product among the company s channels of distribution 
the company believes that this strategy will improve overall performance and profitability of operations 
for the fiscal year ended february   the company achieved its highest level of sales at million  representing an increase of over the previous year 
however  the company s gross profit was adversely impacted by the inability to pass through price increases on its raw material and finished goods 
the company maintains inventory levels based on anticipated demand from its customers taking into consideration the lead time necessary to receive product from the company s suppliers 
the company pays such suppliers on open account based on negotiated terms with the supplier 
the company grants credit to its customers based on their credit worthiness and selling arrangement 
the company generally maintains its inventory at a level to insure prompt delivery to its customers and to provide safety stock levels necessitated by the longer lead times of its foreign suppliers

as described in note c to the consolidated financial statements  the prior year financial statements have been restated 
accounting policies and estimates significant accounting policies are contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following are our most critical accounting policies which are those that require complex judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales when the merchandise is shipped and title has passed to the customer  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
the company provides for estimated costs of future anticipated product returns based on historical experience  when the related revenues are recognized 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs including volume based incentives 
inventory obsolescence the company maintains reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assessments about current and future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were to be less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 

table of contents accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable are principally due from home centers or flooring accessory distributors 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer s financial condition  and collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are due at various times based on each customer s credit worthiness and selling arrangement 
the outstanding balances are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the customer s previous loss history  the customer s ability to pay its obligations and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes the company is required to estimate income tax in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure and deferred income taxes to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts each year end 
the company must then consider the likelihood that the deferred tax asset will be recoverable from future taxable income and to the extent that the company believes that recoverability is not likely  the company establishes a valuation allowance
