lake outsources its manufacturing to third party suppliers 
for more than a year  lake has sold certain communications products to the company in the ordinary course of its business 
key performance indicators that we use to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance include revenues  costs and gross margins  and cash flows 
inter tel recognizes revenue from the following significant sources of revenue end user sales and sales type leases through our direct sales offices and government and national accounts division 
we recognize revenue from sales of systems and services to end user customers upon installation of the systems and performance of the services  respectively  allowing for use by our customers of these systems 
we defer pre payments for communications services and recognize these pre payments as revenue as the communications services are provided 
for our sales type lease accounting  we record the discounted present values of minimum rental payments under sales type leases as sales  net of provisions for continuing administration and other expenses over the lease period 
we record the lease sales at the time of system sale and installation as discussed above for sales to end user customers  and upon receipt of the executed lease documents 
the net rental streams are sold to funding sources on a regular basis with the income streams discounted by prevailing like term rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from such leases are also recorded as net sales 

table of contents dealer and var sales 
for shipments to dealers and other distributors  our revenue is recognized as products are shipped and services are rendered  because the sales process is complete 
title to these products passes when goods are shipped free on board shipping point 
resale of long distance 
we recognize revenue from long distance resale services as services are provided 
software sales 
we recognize revenues from sales of software  such as our new linktivity products discussed above upon shipment to dealers or end users 
maintenance and software support 
maintenance and software support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance or support agreement 
costs and gross margins 
our costs of products sold primarily consist of materials  labor and overhead 
our costs of services performed consist primarily of labor  parts and service overhead 
total costs of goods and services sold increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to in compared to in this margin improvement was attributable to several factors  including a higher proportion of recurring revenues from existing customers in our direct sales offices and government and national accounts division  increased maintenance and services revenues as a percentage of total sales  higher software content in our products  cost containment efforts  product design improvements  and efficiencies achieved with our manufacturing vendors 
sales of systems through our direct sales organization typically generate higher gross margins than sales through our dealers and vars  primarily because we recognize both the wholesale and retail margins on these sales 
conversely  sales of systems through our dealers and vars typically generate lower gross margins than sales through our direct sales organization  although direct sales typically require higher levels of selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  our long distance services and datanet products typically generate lower gross margins than sales of software and system products 
for revenues recognized under sales leases  we record the costs of systems installed as costs of sales 
our margins may vary from period to period depending upon distribution channel  product and software mix 
in the event that sales through our direct sales offices increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could improve 
conversely  in the event net sales to dealers or sales of long distance services increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could decline 
our operating results depend upon a variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders received during a period  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels  general economic conditions and world events impacting businesses  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us and our competitors  pricing pressures  the cost and effect of acquisitions and the availability and cost of products and components from our suppliers 
historically  a substantial portion of our net sales in a given quarter has been recorded in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of such net sales in the last two weeks of the quarter 
there are several factors which attribute to this pattern  including the following customer leases generally expire at end of the month and commence at the beginning of the month  which naturally leads to end of period sales 
these factors apply to both end user and dealer sales 
internal sales compensation programs for our sales personnel are linked to revenues and the sales commissions generally increase at accelerated rates as sales volumes increase 
sales performance bonuses are also frequently tied to quarter end and year end performance targets  providing incentives to sales personnel to close business before the end of each quarter 
some price discounting to our dealer channel occurs during the last month of a quarter or year  and some dealers purchase consistently to take advantage of potential pricing discounts or end of quarter promotions 
dealer buying habits have been consistently applied for years 
in addition  we are subject to seasonal variations in our operating results  as net sales for the first and third quarters are frequently lower than those experienced during the fourth and second quarters  respectively 
followed this historical pattern and we do not anticipate a significant change in this trend 
cash flows 
at december   inter tel s cash and short term investments totaled million 
we also maintain a million unsecured  revolving line of credit with bankone  na  which is available through june  and ordinarily used to support international letters of credit to suppliers  if 
table of contents necessary 
historically  our primary source of cash has come from net income plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expenses 
we have generated cash from continuing operations in every year since in  and  the company received net proceeds from stock offerings  offset in part by cash expended to repurchase the company s common stock 
in addition  inter tel historically has paid cash for capital expenditures of property and equipment or acquisitions 
inter tel has also received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe our working capital and credit facilities  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to develop and expand our business operations  to finance acquisitions of additional resellers of telephony products and other strategic acquisitions or corporate alliances  to fund the special dividend of per share to shareholders of record on march   to repurchase shares of the company s common stock pursuant to a board approved repurchase program of up to million announced in february  and to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
our consolidated revenues from all sources had declined slightly from to  but at a lower rate than the decline in revenues of some of our primary competitors in the business communications systems market 
however  during  net sales increased by million  or compared to net sales for the years ended december  were million 
the decline in net sales in resulted from the effect of general economic conditions and our customers appeared less willing to spend significantly on business communications systems 
the increase in net sales in can be attributed in part to new sales offices acquired during the year  new product releases and improved sales in our long distance resale division 
however  we can provide no assurance that net sales will continue to increase in the future  as we believe businesses may continue to be reluctant to significantly increase spending on enterprise communications systems in the near future 
we believe that enterprises continue to be concerned about their ability to increase revenues and profitability  due in part to the uncertain economic environment of the past few years 
to maintain or improve profitability  we believe that businesses have attempted to reduce costs and capital spending 
we expect continued pressure on our ability to generate or expand sales and it is not clear whether enterprise communications spending will improve in the near term 
we cannot predict the nature  timing and extent of future enterprise investments in communications systems and as a result  if our net sales will increase 
the markets we serve have been characterized by rapid technological changes and increasing customer requirements 
we have sought to address these requirements through the development of software enhancements and improvements to existing systems and the introduction of new systems  products  and applications 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of net sales in  compared to million  or of net sales in the increases in research and development expenses during were primarily attributable to the planned increases in engineering headcount and third party outsourcing of selected development costs in connection with our efforts to accelerate development of new products and software 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars relative to the prior year as we continue to develop and enhance existing and new technologies and products  however  these expenses may vary as a percentage of net sales 
inter tel s research and development efforts over the last several years have been focused primarily on the development of  and enhancements to  our axxess system  including adding new applications  enhancing and developing new ip convergence applications and new sip and ip endpoint technology  developing unified communications applications  developing presence management applications  and developing speech recognition and text to speech applications 
more recently  inter tel s research and development efforts have been focused on the development of the new inter tel network communications family of products  next generation lan enabled telephony platforms  cost reductions of our multi protocol ip endpoints  and the integration of the linktivity web collaboration technology into many of our applications 
we offer our customers a package of lease financing and other services under the name total solution formerly  totalease 
total solution provides our customers lease financing  maintenance and support services  fixed price upgrades and other benefits

net sales increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of million 
the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in sales through our direct sales offices including leasing revenues  dealer network  international  datanet and local and long distance divisions  offset in part by a decrease in sales from our national and government accounts division 
sales from our direct sales offices including leasing revenues increased million or in compared to sales to our dealer network increased by million or in compared to international revenues increased by million or in compared to sales from our datanet division  which sells networking products through our direct sales offices  government and national accounts division and dealer channel  increased million  or in compared to sales from our government and national accounts division decreased slightly by or million  in compared to sales from our local and long distance resale and network services division  increased  or million in to million compared to million in sales increased in our local  long distance resale and network services division despite downward price pressure and significant competition 
increased sales volume has allowed netsolutions  our long distance reseller  to offer more competitive pricing  which improved sales to our existing customer base

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales in  compared to million  or of net sales  in gross profit and gross margin increased in compared to as a result of several factors  including higher software content in our products  cost containment efforts  product design improvements  and efficiencies achieved with our manufacturing vendors 
in addition  during  recurring revenues increased million  or  and our gross margins are generally higher with recurring revenues because we incur lower materials costs compared to new installations 
recurring revenues from existing customers include net sales from maintenance and other services  software additions and or upgrades  support  training and hardware products such as video conferencing  headsets wired and wireless  networking products and speakerphones 
our business communications platforms allow for system migration without the complete change out of hardware  which enables us to offer enhancements and new solutions through software only upgrades to our existing customers 
sales from local and long distance and network services nsg  which includes inter tel netsolutions netsolutions and network services agency nsa  increased by  or million  in compared to although gross margin is generally lower in our long distance division compared to our consolidated gross margin  our gross margin on commissions on network services through nsa generally exceed consolidated gross margin 
the gross margins in nsg decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to lower volume of higher margin nsa revenues  offset in part by improved gross margins in our long distance resale operations due to more favorable pricing with vendors on higher resale volumes 
sales from long distance and network services increased by  or million  in compared to however  sales from nsa decreased  or million  in compared to  which partially offset our overall increase in consolidated gross margin 
the decease in sales from nsa is largely due to changes in to our commission compensation structure from one of our rbocs 
this division generally receives commissions on network services we sell as an agent for rbocs and these sales carry little to no equipment costs and generated margins of approximately in compared to in the decrease in sales from this division therefore partially offset our overall increase in consolidated gross profit and margins 
the overall increases in consolidated gross margin noted above were also offset in part by continued competitive pricing pressures in our direct sales offices  government and national accounts and dealer channels in  including pricing discounts or special competitor promotions on telephone system and software sales and related equipment 
our margins may vary from period to period depending upon distribution channel  product and software mix 
in the event that sales through our direct sales offices increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could improve 
conversely  in the event net sales to dealers or sales of long distance services increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could decline 
sales of scrap were not significant during the year ended december  and had no effect on gross margin 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of net sales in  compared to million  or of net sales in included in research and development expenses in and was amortization of patents totaling  in each period 
the increases in research and development expenses during were primarily attributable to the increased engineering headcount and third party outsourcing of selected development costs in connection with our efforts to accelerate development of new products and software 
to a lesser extent  the increases were also attributable to increased research and development spending related to our development of convergence applications and new sip and ip endpoint technology 
in  research and development expenses were directed principally toward the continued development of converged features on the axxess system  development of the new inter tel converged systems and software  unified messaging and voice processing software  speech recognition and text to speech applications  call center applications  unified communications applications  ip endpoint development  and certain cti and ivr applications and sip applications 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars relative to the prior year as we continue to develop and enhance existing and new technologies and products 
these expenses may vary  however  as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars to million in  an increase of compared to million in however  these expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in 
table of contents the increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increased expenses associated with the increases in consolidated net sales in compared to  compensation and benefits cost increases of million due to increased headcount and higher costs of health benefits  and additional costs related to the opening and operation of new sales offices in philadelphia  tennessee  south carolina  pittsburgh and las vegas totaling million 
higher net sales in our direct sales offices including acquisitions and long distance resale division led to increased selling expenses and commission costs in relative to such costs in in  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the greater leverage of fixed expenses on the higher volume of sales  relative to our consolidated bad debt costs decreased in compared to and also decreased as a percentage of total net sales  based on improved credit and collections on existing accounts receivable 
we expect for the foreseeable future selling  general and administrative expenses will increase sequentially in absolute dollars assuming we increase sales and continue to enhance existing and develop new technologies and products 
these expenses may vary  however  as a percentage of net sales

the write off of japan consisted of the recognition of the valuation allowance and japanese loss  as well as a tax benefit for the write off of the investment 
the company will write off an estimated million of intercompany receivables for which the japanese subsidiary will have corresponding income for the forgiveness of debt 
this income will be offset by net operating loss carryforwards 
the tax benefit is or approximately million 
in prior years the tax benefit of the japanese operations were offset by a valuation allowance due to historical losses and an inability to project future income by management 
net deferred tax liabilities increased in primarily due to accelerated depreciation of fixed assets  temporary differences relating to leases in our total solution program and utilization of taxable losses which decreased the net operating loss carryforward deferred asset 
the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets is due to the bonus depreciation of enacted in the jobs creation act 
this acceleration of depreciation expenses ceases for new purchases after december  the combination of accelerated depreciation and leasing transactions gave rise to a net operating loss in these losses were carried back to and carried forward to and the remaining million of deferred tax asset is expected to be fully utilized in the effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately  without taking into consideration the effect of the lake acquisition 
the rate is expected to be lower than the effective tax rate primarily due to the removal of the effect on taxes of the e rate settlement and write off of japan operations

this net operating loss created deferred assets for net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credit carryforwards  each of which is separately identified in the components of deferred tax assets and liabilities schedule included in note j to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect these carryforwards to be fully utilized by our effective income tax rate for was not significantly impacted by these carryforwards 
net income 
net income for decreased to million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  including the litigation settlement in the decrease was primarily attributable to income from net proceeds of an arbitration settlement in the net proceeds from this arbitration settlement were approximately million after taxes  or per diluted share for the year ended december  excluding the litigation settlement  we would have reported net income of million  or per diluted share in the decrease in net income of in  excluding the settlement  was primarily the result of lower profits on a lower volume of sales  higher research and development expenses and higher amortization costs  offset by higher gross profit margins described in further detail above 
other charges 
set forth herein is a further description of the items reflected in other charges during the years ended december  and  as well as subsequent events and activity occurring through inter tel 
net comm services vianet 
during the second quarter of  inter tel recorded a pre tax charge associated with inter tel 
net operations of million million after tax  related to the write down to net realizable value of network equipment and lease termination costs of certain redundant facilities 
the reserves established at the time of the write down have been fully utilized as of december  on july   inter tel sold of the stock of inter tel 
net  inc to comm services corporation for a note of million  collateralized by comm services stock  other marketable securities of the shareholders of comm services and of the net assets of inter tel 
net 
in connection with the sale of of inter tel 
net  we assessed the fair value of the remaining investment in inter tel 
net 
pursuant to sfas  we recorded a charge as of the close of the second quarter of of million million after tax associated with the impairment of our investment in inter tel 
net 
after the 
table of contents impairment charge  the carrying value of our investment the note receivable from comm services plus the ownership interest in comm services totaled million as of december  the charge was primarily non cash 
inter tel s management has not participated in the management of inter tel 
net since its partial sale in july as a result  since july   we have accounted for the remaining inter tel 
net comm services investment using the cost method of accounting 
on december   comm services entered into a merger agreement with vianet 
inter tel s investment in comm services was converted to approximately of vianet stock and as a result  vianet assumed the loan for the purchase and inter tel continued to hold collateral from the former shareholders of comm services until march during  the net investment in the notes receivable and interest in vianet formerly comm services was written down by million and was recorded in other assets at a carrying value of approximately million as of december   which approximated management s estimate of the related collateral value at that time 
during  and  inter tel 
net entered into operating lease agreements totaling approximately million from an equipment vendor for network equipment and software 
the lease agreements required inter tel 
net to purchase vendor maintenance on their products 
inter tel originally guaranteed the indebtedness 
in february  we executed an agreement with vianet and this vendor releasing inter tel from its guarantee of any and all of these obligations  and inter tel and vianet released the vendor from claims arising from the failure of the network equipment and software previously leased 
as part of this agreement  inter tel also received payment from the vianet shareholders of million  in exchange for the release of the remaining collateral and as payment of the loan 
inter tel had also retained a collateral interest in a vianet shareholder s variable forward option contract that matured in april and may of  and for which we received no value for the collateral interest 
after an adjustment of  in related to a recovery of our investment and adjustment of projected costs to actual costs associated with the write down in the vianet investment  the estimated value received in this transaction was equivalent to our remaining investment value  less accruals for potential obligations to the vendor discussed above 
inter tel retains its ownership interest in vianet and will account for the remaining investment interest of approximately in vianet using the cost method of accounting 
at december  and  our net investment in vianet was recorded at no value 
executone 
on january  inter tel purchased certain computer telephony assets and assumed certain liabilities of executone information systems  inc executone 
the executone transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired  of which million million after taxes was written off as purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the executone acquisition  we sold executone s manufacturing assets and liabilities to varian of tempe  arizona at a net book value of million 
during the second quarter of  we decided to close the primary executone facility in milford  connecticut and to recognize a restructuring charge related to our exit plan and closure of the executone operations 
we have accounted for the restructuring of the executone operations  including severance and related costs  the shut down and consolidation of the milford facility and the impairment of assets associated with the restructuring 
we finalized our plan for the exiting of activities and the involuntary termination or relocation of the employees 
accrued costs associated with this plan were estimates  although the original estimates made for the second quarter of for reserve balances have not changed significantly as of december  exit costs associated with the closure of the milford facility also included liabilities for building  furniture and equipment lease  and other contractual obligations 
we are liable for the lease on the milford buildings through january  various other furniture  computer and equipment leases terminated on varying dates through september to date  we have entered into sublease agreements with third parties to sublease portions of the facility 
the reserve for lease and other contractual obligations is identified in the table below 
the total restructuring charge from this event totaled million

inflation currency fluctuation inflation and currency fluctuations have not previously had a material impact on inter tel s operations 
international procurement agreements have traditionally been denominated in us currency 
moreover  a significant amount of contract manufacturing has been or may be moved to alternative sources 
the expansion of international operations in the united kingdom and europe and increased sales  if any  in ireland  europe and australia as a result of the lake acquisition could result in higher international sales as a percentage of total revenues  however  international revenues do not currently represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes increase in cash and equivalents cash and equivalents at beginning of year cash and equivalents at end of year at december   cash and equivalents and short term investments totaled million  which represented an increase of approximately million from the million total at december  in addition  long term investments in marketable debt securities totaled million at december   compared to no long term investments in marketable debt securities at december  or in prior years 
we maintain a million unsecured  revolving line of credit with bankone  na  which is available through june  under the credit facility  we have the option to borrow at a prime rate or adjusted libor 
table of contents interest rate 
historically  we have used the credit facility primarily to support international letters of credit to suppliers 
a portion of our cash balances may be used for  among other things  acquisitions  strategic alliances  working capital and general corporate purposes 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from net income plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expenses  provision for losses on receivables and leases  increased deferred income taxes and the change in operating assets and liabilities 
cash generated by the increase in deferred income taxes in totaled million compared to million in cash provided by the change in operating assets and liabilities was million in  compared to million used in operating assets and liabilities in the primary factors for cash provided by operating accounts in was a decrease in the income tax receivable  an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  offset in part by an increase in inventories  increased accounts receivable and increased net investment in sales leases 
we expect to expand sales through our direct sales office and dealer networks  which is expected to require the expenditure of working capital for increased accounts receivable  inventories and net investment in sales leases 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   primarily in the form of million used to purchase held to maturity investments  million used in capital expenditures and million used in acquisitions and other investments  which was partially offset by the net reduction in short term investments of million 
cash used in capital expenditures and in acquisitions and other investments totaled million and million  respectively in cash was provided by sales of short term investments net of purchases of million in as compared to million used in purchasing short term investments net of sales and maturities in we anticipate continued capital expenditures during  principally relating to expenditures for equipment  personal computers and management information systems used in operations  facilities expansion and acquisition activities 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during compared to million in net cash used for cash dividends totaled million in and million during cash provided by the exercise of stock options and stock issuances pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan totaled million in and million in although we did not expend cash for stock repurchases in  we expended approximately  for stock repurchases during funded by existing cash balances 
repayment of our long term debt for the year was  compared to  in during  we reissued treasury shares through stock option exercises and issuances  with the proceeds received totaling more than the cost basis of the treasury stock reissued 
accordingly  the difference was recorded as an increase to retained earnings 
during  we reissued treasury shares through stock option exercises and issuances  with the proceeds received totaling less than the cost basis of the treasury stock reissued 
accordingly  the difference was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings 
we offer to our customers lease financing and other services  including our totalsolution formerly totalease program  through our inter tel leasing  inc subsidiary 
we fund our total solution program in part through the sale to financial institutions of rental payment streams under the leases 
sold lease rentals totaling and million remained unbilled at december  and december   respectively 
such financial institutions have the option to require us to repurchase such income streams  subject to limitations  in the event of defaults by lease customers and  accordingly  we maintain reserves based on loss experience and past due accounts 
although we to date have been able to resell the rental streams from leases under the totalsolution program profitably and on a substantially current basis  the timing and profitability of lease resales could impact our business and operating results  particularly in an environment of fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty 
if we are required to repurchase rental streams and realize losses thereon in amounts exceeding our reserves  our operating results will be adversely affected 
on january   the company received court approval of a civil settlement agreement the civil settlement and a criminal plea agreement the plea agreement with the united states of america  each dated as of december  and disclosed on that same date 
the court approval of the civil settlement and plea agreement resolves the investigation of the department of justice into the participation of inter tel technologies  inc  the company s wholly owned subsidiary technologies in a federally administered e rate program to connect schools and libraries to the internet 
in connection with the civil settlement  technologies agreed to pay a penalty of  and forego the collection of certain accounts receivable 
table of contents of  related to technologies participation in the e rate program 
in connection with the plea agreement  technologies entered guilty pleas to charges of mail fraud and an antitrust violation 
under the plea agreement  technologies agreed to pay a fine of  and observe a three year probationary period  which will  among other things  require technologies to implement a comprehensive corporate compliance program 
the resolution is currently expected to cost inter tel approximately million in total  including criminal fines  civil settlement and restitution  uncompensated e rate work  accounts receivable forgiveness  and related remaining attorneys fees and other expenses 
the payments constituting the primary components of the settlement are not tax deductible 
the effect of the resolution on fourth quarter results of operations was a reduction to net income by approximately million  after considering accounts receivable reserves previously accrued and an income tax benefit of approximately million related to attorneys fees and other expenses 
in addition  on january   inter tel technologies received notification from the federal communications commission that the technologies subsidiary was temporarily suspended from participation in the e rate program pending a proposed debarment 
technologies has contested the scope and length of the proposed debarment from the e rate program  but there can be no assurance that technologies will be successful in this regard 
revenues in relating to inter tel technologies participation in the e rate program were not significant 
the existence and disclosure of the civil settlement  plea agreement and fcc notice may have already caused competitive harm to inter tel  and these matters may further harm inter tel s business 
we believe our working capital and credit facilities  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to develop and expand our business operations  to finance acquisitions of additional resellers of telephony products and other strategic acquisitions or corporate alliances  to fund the special dividend of per share to shareholders of record on march   to repurchase shares of the company s common stock pursuant to a board approved repurchase program  and to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
however  to the extent additional funds are required in the future to address working capital needs and to provide funding for capital expenditures  expansion of the business or additional acquisitions  we will seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance additional financing will be available when required or on acceptable terms 
contractual obligations we had the following contractual obligations outstanding amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands total less than year years years after years december  operating lease obligations  primarily for building and equipment leases totals at december  total contractual obligations do not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
noncancellable operating leases are primarily for buildings 
certain of the operating leases contain provisions for renewal options and scheduled rent increases 
at december   future minimum commitments under noncancellable leases  including our headquarters facility and a year lease for our research and development facility and month lease for our distribution and support facility  are as follows  thereafter  beginning in  we leased a milford  connecticut building in connection with the executone acquisition 
the lease expired on january   and we did not renew that lease 
the costs included in the milford operating lease are  in and are reflected in the operating lease obligation totals noted above 
in connection with the executone charge taken in  we included in the charge the anticipated lease costs through the lease termination date  offset by expected sublease receipts 
the total costs included in operating lease obligations referred to above  which are associated with the milford lease  total million in and  in purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purpose of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on inter tel and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our forecasted manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for four months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

table of contents the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
in connection with the acquisition of the rights to certain developed technology for a capitalized purchase price of million included in purchased intangible assets during the year ended december   the company entered into an arrangement with the selling entity under which the selling entity would perform additional development activities on a cost reimbursement basis 
under the terms of the arrangement  the selling entity could also earn bonus payments totaling up to  for meeting certain development milestones 
milestone bonuses totaling  for the year ended december  were achieved and expensed as research and development costs 
technological feasibility of the underlying technology has not yet been achieved to provide for viable product sales 
as of december   the remaining milestone bonus of  is dependent on future events and is not considered to be probable or reasonably estimable 
the following table summarizes details of the expenses in connection with this technology investment recorded during the respective periods in thousands milestone bonus payments development activities on a cost reimbursement basis totals off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that involve unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
however  we offer to our customers lease financing and other services through our inter tel leasing  inc subsidiary 
we fund our total solution program in part through the sale to financial institutions of rental payment streams under the leases 
such financial institutions have the option to require us to repurchase such income streams  subject to limitations  in the event of defaults by lease customers and  accordingly  we maintain reserves based on loss experience and past due accounts 
for more information regarding our lease portfolio and financing  please see liquidity and capital resources above and notes a and d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
the company applies the provisions of sab to all revenue transactions 
sab supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the primary purpose of sab is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the issuance of sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling 
table of contents price is both fixed and determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably probable 
revenue derived from sales of systems and services to end user customers is recognized upon primary installation of the systems and performance of the services  respectively  allowing for use by our customers of these systems 
pre payments for communications services are deferred and recognized as revenue as the communications services are provided 
for shipments to dealers and other distributors  our revenues are recorded as products are shipped and services are rendered  because the sales process is complete 
these shipments are primarily to third party dealers and distributors  and title passes when goods are shipped free on board shipping point 
long distance services revenues are recognized as service is provided 
we provide a number of incentives  promotions and awards to certain dealers and other distributors 
these incentives primarily represent discounts which are recognized as a reduction of sales  advertising allowances and awards which are recognized as marketing expense and management assistance which is expensed as incurred 
revenues for sales of software to dealers or end users are generally recognized upon shipment 
revenues related to software support and maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the life of the support or maintenance agreements 
sales leases 
for our sales type lease accounting  we follow the guidance provided by fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases and fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
we record the discounted present values of minimum rental payments under sales type leases as sales  net of provisions for continuing administration and other expenses over the lease period 
we record the lease sales at the time of system sale and installation pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 as discussed above for sales to end user customers  and upon receipt of the executed lease documents 
the costs of systems installed under these sales leases are recorded as costs of sales 
the net rental streams are sold to funding sources on a regular basis with the income streams discounted by prevailing like term rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from such leases are recorded as net sales 
we establish and maintain reserves against potential recourse following the resales based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
the allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments and recourse liability at the end of the year represents reserves against the entire lease portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as required 
these reserves are either netted in the accounts receivable  current and long term components of net investments in sales leases on the balance sheet  or included in long term liabilities on our balance sheet for off balance sheet leases 
historically  our reserves have been adequate to cover write offs 
during the year ended december   our total reserve for losses related to the lease portfolio declined from to  primarily as a result of improved write off experience and accounts receivable agings 
should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate in the future  additional reserves in amounts that could be material to the financial statements could be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
inter tel follows sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
purchase prices of acquired businesses that are accounted for as purchases have been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates 
based on these values  the excess purchase prices over the fair value of the net assets acquired were allocated to goodwill 
on january   inter tel began accounting for goodwill under the provisions of sfas nos 
and and discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
as of december   inter tel had gross goodwill of million and accumulated amortization of million 
inter tel completed five acquisitions in and one in and has not recorded any amortization for these acquisitions on amounts allocated to goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
the company performs an annual impairment test on goodwill using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
in addition  the company will perform impairment tests during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have incurred 
inter tel performed the first step of the required impairment tests for goodwill as of december  and 
table of contents determined that goodwill is not impaired and it is not necessary to record any impairment losses related to goodwill 
in  million of the company s goodwill  net of amortization  relates to the company s principal segment and million relates to the network services segment 
there is only one reporting unit ie  one component as defined in paragraph of sfas within each of the company s two operating segments as defined in paragraph of sfas therefore  the reporting units are identical to the segments 
fair value has been determined for each segment in order to determine the recoverability of the recorded goodwill 
at december   the company primarily considered an allocated portion of the market capitalization for the entire company using average common stock prices in determining that no impairment has occurred 
this allocated market capitalization value far exceeded the net carrying value of the goodwill included in the financial statements 
therefore  the second step for potential impairment was unnecessary 
the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of its purchased intangible assets  all of which are subject to amortization  each reporting period 
any changes to estimated remaining lives prospectively effect the remaining period of amortization 
in addition  the purchased intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
a loss would be recognized for any excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value 
as of december   inter tel had gross purchased intangible assets of million and accumulated amortization of million 
at december  and december   goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million  respectively 
other acquisition related intangibles  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million at december  and million at december  accumulated amortization through december was million  including million of accumulated amortization attributable to goodwill and million of accumulated amortization of other acquisition related intangibles 
accumulated amortization through december  was million  including million of accumulated amortization attributable to goodwill and million of accumulated amortization of other acquisition related intangibles 
other acquisition related intangibles  comprised primarily of developed technology year lives  customer lists year lives and non competition agreements year lives  are amortized on a straight line basis 
the useful lives for developed technology are based on the remaining lives of patents acquired or the estimated useful life of the technology  whichever is shorter 
the useful lives of the customer lists are based on the expected period of value for such lists 
the useful lives for non competition agreements are based on the contractual terms of the agreements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
additional reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for our sales type leases  discussed above in sales leases 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
in evaluating our allowance we consider accounts in excess of days old as well as other risks in the more current portions of the accounts included 
if the financial condition of our customers or channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost principally on a standard cost basis  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method or market 
significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory and we make our assessment primarily on a significant product by product basis and whether such products turned in the immediately preceding twelve month period  adjusted for expected changes in projected sales or marketing demand 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or obsolete  or because the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet estimated future needs 
we consider criteria such as customer demand  product life cycles  changing technologies  slow moving inventory and market conditions 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in estimating our reserves for obsolescence  we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a month period and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated month demand  as well as evaluating reserves for specific classifications of inventory  including new  used and staged inventory for specific customers 
if actual customer demand  product life cycles  changing technologies and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 

table of contents income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at december   our gross deferred tax asset was million 
numerous taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax positions taken by businesses 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these jurisdictions 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense would result 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss  or can estimate a minimum amount of a loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending claims and litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our claims and pending litigation  revise our estimates and accrue for any losses to the extent that they are probable and the amount is estimable 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
however  at december   management did not believe that the ultimate impact of various claims and pending litigation would have a materially adverse impact on the company 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment 
this statement is a revision to sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
this statement will require us to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements  and is effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  sfas no 
r permits public companies to choose between the following two adoption methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the apb no 
intrinsic value method and recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options or the employee stock purchase plan shares 
as proposed  companies would be required to recognize an expense for compensation costs related to share based payment arrangements  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  valuation of employee stock options under sfas no 
r is similar to sfas no 
 with some exceptions 
for 
table of contents information about what our reported results of operations and earnings per share would have been had we adopted sfas no 
 see the discussion under the heading stock based compensation in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
due to timing of the release of sfas no 
r  we have not yet completed the analysis of the ultimate impact that this new pronouncement will have on the results of operations  nor the method of adoption for this new standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our non trading investment portfolio 
inter tel maintains a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents typically maturing in three months or less as of the date of purchase 
inter tel makes investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the company also maintains short term and long term investments 
those investments that are classified as available for sale have been recorded at fair value  which approximates cost 
those investments that are classified as held to maturity have been recorded at cost and amortized to face value 
short term investments include certificates of deposit  auction rate certificates  auction rate preferred securities  municipal preferred securities  federal agency issues and mutual funds 
the auction rate securities are adjustable rate securities with dividend rates that are reset periodically by bidders through periodic dutch auctions generally conducted every to days by a trust company or broker dealer on behalf of the issuer 
the company believes these securities are highly liquid investments through the related auctions  however  the collateralizing securities have stated terms of up to thirty one years 
the long term investments consist of federal agency issues 
both the short term and the long term instruments are rated a or higher by standard poor s ratings group  or equivalent 
the company s short term investments are intended to establish a high quality portfolio that preserves principal  meets liquidity needs  avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to the company s investment guidelines and market conditions 
given the short term nature of the majority of these investments  and that we have no borrowings outstanding  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
lease portfolio 
we offer to our customers lease financing and other services  including our total solutions program  through our inter tel leasing subsidiary 
we fund these programs in part through the sale to financial institutions of rental payment streams under the leases 
upon the sale of the rental payment streams  we continue to service the leases and maintain limited recourse on the leases 
we maintain reserves for loan losses on all leases based on historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
although to date we have been able to resell the rental streams from leases under our lease programs profitably and on a substantially current basis  the timing and profitability of lease resales could impact our business and operating results  particularly in an environment of fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty 
if we were required to repurchase rental streams and realize losses thereon in amounts exceeding our reserves  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
see liquidity and capital resources in management s discussion and analysis and notes a and d of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our lease portfolio and financing 
impact of foreign currency rate changes 
we invoice the customers of our international subsidiaries primarily in the local currencies of our subsidiaries for product and service revenues 
inter tel is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes have not historically been significant 
the march acquisition of entities in ireland could increase our exposure to foreign currency rate changes
