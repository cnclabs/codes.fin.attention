see statements of changes in partners capital and comprehensive income in item for further details 
alliance holding is required to distribute all of its available cash flow  as defined in the alliance holding partnership agreement  to its unitholders 
the decrease in available cash flow and distributions in reflects the million in charges taken during the second half of for mutual fund matters and legal proceedings 
the third quarter distribution was declared prior to the recording of the charge 
over the next two quarters  distributions were reduced  reflecting the million in charges 
commencing in the second quarter  quarterly distributions returned to traditional levels in relation to cash flow 
cash and cash equivalents were zero at december    and cash inflows from alliance capital distributions received were offset by cash distributions paid to unitholders  income taxes paid and the movement in other working capital items 
management believes that the cash flow from its investment in alliance capital will provide alliance holding with the financial resources to meet its capital obligations 
commitments and contingencies see note of the alliance holding financial statements contained in item alliance capital executive overview we provide diversified investment management services to institutional clients  high net worth clients and retail investors 
at december   we had client assets under management of billion invested in growth and value equities  blended equities  fixed income and passive services 
our strategy is to leverage our extensive research capabilities by providing innovative and time tested wealth management solutions to help our clients achieve investment success and peace of mind 
through our sanford c 
bernstein co  llc subsidiary  we also provide in depth research  portfolio strategy and trade execution services to institutional clients 
importantly  we are striving to ensure that our firm s culture is one in which client interests are always placed first and the highest ethical standards are maintained 
our revenues are primarily earned for managing the investment assets of our clients 
these revenues vary with the total value of our assets under management  which increase or decrease depending upon capital market appreciation or depreciation  investment returns achieved for clients  and asset inflows or outflows from new and existing clients 
substantially all of the equity market gains in occurred during the fourth quarter 
both our us and us equity including both growth and value services performed well 
specifically  our large cap growth  disciplined growth  and mid cap growth equity services outperformed their respective benchmarks 
also  our separately managed account programs continued to perform well 
we believe our investment performance is generally competitive 
in  we continued to focus on growing our business globally 
assets under management for our non us services grew by to billion in and assets managed for our non us clients increased by to billion 
we believe that our greatest opportunities for long term asset growth continue to be in non us markets 
accordingly  we are building our already significant presence in these markets  leveraging our existing relationships with clients and third party consultants 
we believe that few managers can match the depth and breadth of our capabilities in research  asset management and client service  providing us with significant competitive advantages 
growth in our institutional investment management services unit was due to significant flows into our global value equity and blend services  resulting from our strong investment performance 
for the year  global and non us institutional inflows increased by to billion  but were offset by billion in us outflows 
in the us  despite improved investment performance in us growth equity services  we continued to experience client attrition 
however  our fixed income services experienced net asset inflows of approximately billion  primarily from axa affiliates 
our retail services unit continued to experience net redemptions  primarily in large cap growth equities  due in part to non competitive long term investment performance 
we changed our management team and repositioned our retail offerings  the benefits of which we are just beginning to realize 
this year  we reduced our fund management fees  simplified our prospectus disclosures and initiated a multi year process to rationalize the funds we offer to clients 
our separately managed account programs experienced continued strong investment performance 
our alliancebernstein wealth strategies series  launched in  surpassed billion in assets under management 
despite our progress in  our market share in us long term retail funds remains depressed 
during the year  we entered into an agreement to sell our cash management services unit to federated investors  which we estimate will result in a capital gain of approximately per alliance holding unit in contingent payments received from federated in the five years following the closing of the transaction are expected to largely offset the loss of that business s anticipated profit contribution 
in our private client services unit  we opened new offices in boston  philadelphia and tampa in  for  we plan to open three additional offices 
we also increased the number of financial advisors by to effective january   we eliminated transaction charges on us equity services for many of our private clients  while increasing our asset based fees 
our institutional research services unit experienced double digit revenue growth during in the us  increased market share more than offset lower pricing experienced throughout the industry 
we also experienced strong revenue growth in our london operations  established in the expansion of our trading capabilities in us and us markets has enabled us to capture additional market share 
most importantly  we continue to deliver high quality  in depth research as recognized in major investor polls  thereby enabling us to retain a leadership position in the industry 
recent declines in commission rates charged by broker dealers are likely to continue and may accelerate 
increasing use of electronic trading networks which permit investors to execute securities transactions at a fraction of typical full service broker dealer charges and pressure on broker dealers by funds and institutional investors are likely to result in a significant decline in commission rates  which would  in turn  reduce the securities transaction revenues generated by our institutional research services unit 
another significant initiative that benefits all of our clients is our continued investment in research  a core competency of our firm 
we have a broad foundation in fundamental and quantitative research 
our fundamental research includes comprehensive industry and company coverage from growth  value and fixed income perspectives 
our current focus in quantitative research is based on three areas finding and exploiting pricing anomalies in the capital markets  solving complex investment planning problems  and utilizing portfolio construction tools to optimize global portfolios 
assets under management our assets under management as of december  and previous years have been reclassified by investment service and distribution channel  including the fixed income components of balanced accounts previously reported in equity  to better align publicly reported assets under management with our internal reporting 
as a result  approximately billion in assets under management were reclassified from equity billion from growth equity and billion from value equity to fixed income 
in addition  certain fixed income assets managed for insurance company clients previously reported at cost are now being reported at market value  resulting in approximate increases in fixed income assets under management of between billion and billion at each reporting date

capital resources and liquidity the following table identifies selected items relating to capital resources and liquidity change change in millions  except per unit amounts as of december partners capital cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december cash flow from operations proceeds from exercise of options capital expenditures purchases of alliance holding units distributions paid available cash flow distributions per alliance capital unit the significant factors affecting the change in partners capital year to year are net income and proceeds from the exercise of options to acquire alliance holding units  both increasing partners capital  and cash distributions paid to unitholders  decreasing partners capital 
alliance capital is required to distribute all of its available cash flow  as defined in the alliance capital partnership agreement  to its unitholders 
the decrease in available cash flow and distributions in reflects the million in charges taken during the second half of for mutual fund matters and legal proceedings 
the third quarter distribution was declared prior to recording the charge 
thus  over the next two quarters  distributions were withheld until we earned back the distribution paid in the third quarter of commencing in the second quarter of  quarterly distributions returned to traditional levels in relation to cash flow 
cash and cash equivalents increased million and million in and  respectively  and decreased million in cash inflows are primarily provided from operations and from the proceeds from the exercise of options for alliance holding units 
significant cash outflows are cash distributions paid to unitholders  purchases of alliance holding units to fund deferred compensation plans and capital expenditures 
on january   we deposited an additional million in united states treasury bills in a special reserve account pursuant to rule c requirements 
on january   we withdrew million in united states treasury bills from a special reserve account pursuant to rule c requirements 
contingent deferred sales charge our mutual fund distribution system the system includes a multi class share structure that permits our open end mutual funds to offer investors various options for the purchase of mutual fund shares  including both front end load shares and back end load shares 
for front end load shares  abirm pays sales commissions to financial intermediaries distributing the funds from the conventional front end sales charge it receives from investors at the time of sale

debt and credit facilities total available credit  debt outstanding  and weighted average interest rates as of december  and were as follows december  credit available debt outstanding interest rate credit available debt outstanding interest rate in millions senior notes commercial paper revolving credit facility extendible commercial notes other n a n a total in august  we issued million notes senior notes pursuant to a shelf registration statement under which we may issue up to million in senior debt securities 
the senior notes mature in and are redeemable at any time 
the proceeds from the senior notes were used to reduce commercial paper and credit facility borrowings and for other general partnership purposes 
in september  we entered into an million five year revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks and other lenders 
of the million total  million is intended to provide back up liquidity for our million commercial paper program  with the balance available for general purposes 
under this revolving credit facility  the interest rate  at our option  is a floating rate generally based upon a defined prime rate  a rate related to the london interbank offered rate libor or the federal funds rate 
the revolving credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  require us to meet certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with the covenants as of december  at december   we maintained a million extendible commercial notes ecn program as a supplement to our million commercial paper program 
ecns are short term uncommitted debt instruments that do not require back up liquidity support 
our substantial equity base and access to public and private debt  at competitive terms  should provide adequate liquidity for our general business needs 
management believes that cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and alliance capital units or alliance holding units will provide us with the financial resources to meet our capital obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below 
guarantees in february  alliance capital signed a million agreement with a commercial bank  under which we guaranteed certain obligations in the ordinary course of business of scbl 
in the event scbl is unable to meet its obligations in full when due  alliance capital will pay the obligations within three days of being notified of scbl s failure to pay 
this agreement is continuous and remains in effect until payment in full of any such obligation has been made by scbl 
during  we were not required to perform under the agreement and at december  had no liability outstanding in connection with the agreement 
aggregate contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions debt operating leases  net of sublease commitments accrued compensation and benefits minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries total certain of our deferred compensation plans provide for election by participants to invest a portion of their deferred compensation awards in alliance holding units and make notional investments in company sponsored mutual funds 
during the first two months of  we made purchases of company sponsored mutual funds totaling million to fund our future obligations resulting from participant elections with respect to awards 
we previously purchased alliance holding units with an aggregate value of approximately million to fund awards that have since been forfeited 
these alliance holding units were held in a deferred compensation trust as of december  to fund our future obligations to participants who elected to invest a portion of their awards in alliance holding units 
we expect to make contributions to our qualified profit sharing plan of approximately million in each of the next four years 
we are required to contribute additional amounts to our qualified  noncontributory  defined benefit plan by january  we currently estimate this amount to be million and expect to make this contribution during the fourth quarter of any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as payables to broker dealers  brokerage clients  and our mutual funds and accounts payables and accrued expenses are excluded from the table above 
accrued compensation and benefits amounts above exclude liabilities due within one year and accrued pension expense 
contingencies see note of alliance capital s consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of our mutual fund distribution system and related deferred sales commission asset  certain legal proceedings to which we are a party  and mutual fund investigations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
deferred sales commission asset management tests the deferred sales commission asset for impairment quarterly  or monthly when events or changes in circumstances occur that could significantly increase the risk of impairment of the asset 
significant assumptions utilized to estimate the company s future average assets under management and undiscounted future cash flows from back end load shares include expected future market levels and redemption rates 
market assumptions are selected using a long term view of expected average market returns based on historical returns of broad market indices 
at december   management used average market return assumptions of for fixed income and for equity to estimate annual market returns 
higher actual average market returns would increase undiscounted future cash flows  while lower actual average market returns would decrease undiscounted future cash flows 
future redemption rate assumptions were determined by reference to actual redemption experience over the five year  three year and one year periods ended december  based on the actual redemption rates  including increased redemption rates experienced more recently  management used a range of possible annual redemption rates of   and at december   calculated as a percentage of the company s average assets under management of back end load shares 
an increase in the actual rate of redemptions would decrease undiscounted future cash flows  while a decrease in the actual rate of redemptions would increase undiscounted future cash flows 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated quarterly  or monthly when events or changes in circumstances occur that could significantly increase the risk of impairment of the asset 
estimates of undiscounted future cash flows and the remaining life of the deferred sales commission asset are made from these assumptions and the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the recorded value of the deferred sales commission asset 
management considers the results of these analyses performed at various dates 
as of december   management determined that the deferred sales commission asset was not impaired 
if management determines in the future that the deferred sales commission asset is not recoverable  an impairment condition would exist and a loss would be measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is determined using management s best estimate of future cash flows discounted to a present value amount 
goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is tested annually  at september  for impairment 
significant assumptions are required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include determining whether the estimated fair value of alliance capital  the reporting unit  exceeds its book value 
there are several methods of estimating alliance capital s fair value  which includes valuation techniques such as market quotations and discounted expected cash flows 
in developing estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation technique  business growth rate assumptions are applied over the estimated life of the goodwill asset and the resulting expected cash flows are discounted to arrive at a present value amount that approximates fair value 
as of september   the impairment test indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
also  as of december   management believes that goodwill was not impaired 
however  future tests may be based upon different assumptions which may or may not result in an impairment of this asset 
any impairment could reduce materially the recorded amount of the goodwill asset with a corresponding charge to our earnings 
intangible assets acquired intangibles are recognized at fair value and amortized over their estimated useful lives of twenty years 
intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
a present value technique is applied to management s best estimate of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of intangible assets 
estimated fair value is then compared to the recorded book value to determine whether an impairment is indicated 
the estimates used include estimating attrition factors of customer accounts  asset growth rates  direct expenses and fee rates 
we choose assumptions based on actual historical trends that may or may not occur in the future 
as of december   management believes that intangible assets were not impaired 
however  future tests may be based upon different assumptions which may or may not result in an impairment of this asset 
any impairment could reduce materially the recorded amount of intangible assets with a corresponding charge to our earnings 
loss contingencies management continuously reviews with legal counsel the status of regulatory matters and pending or threatened litigation 
we evaluate the likelihood that a loss contingency exists in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires a loss contingency to be recorded if it is probable and reasonably estimable as of the date of the financial statements 
based on our evaluation  except as described in note of alliance capital s consolidated financial statements in item  no contingency losses have been recorded as of december  and accounting pronouncements see note of alliance capital s consolidated financial statements in item forward looking statements certain statements provided by management in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the most significant of these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the performance of financial markets  the investment performance of sponsored investment products and separately managed accounts  general economic conditions  future acquisitions  competitive conditions and government regulations  including changes in tax rates 
we caution readers to carefully consider such factors 
further  such forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
for further information regarding these forward looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ  see risk factors in item any or all of the forward looking statements that we make in this form k or any other public statements we issue may turn out to be wrong 
it is important to remember that other factors besides those listed in risk factors could also adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
the forward looking statements referred to in the preceding paragraph include statements regarding the outcome of litigation and the effect on future earnings of the sale of our cash management services unit to federated investors  inc sale 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  and excessive judgments do occur 
though we have stated that we do not expect certain legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial condition  any settlement or judgment on the merits of a legal proceeding could be significant  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the effect of the sale on future earnings  resulting from contingent payments to be received in future periods  will depend on the amount of net revenue earned by federated during these periods on assets under management maintained in federated s funds by our former cash management clients 
the amount of capital gain realized upon closing the transaction depends on the transaction expenses we incur and on an initial payment by federated  some of which would  in certain circumstances  need to be returned
