item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional geographic data 
micros s significant international business and presence expose the company to certain market risks  such as currency  interest rate and political risks 
with respect to currency risk  the company transacts business in different currencies through its foreign subsidiaries 
the fluctuation of currencies impacts sales and profitability 
frequently  sales and the costs associated with those sales are not denominated in the same currency 
in addition as of june   the company did invest in one financial instrument for zar south african rand million forward contract which is designed to protect against foreign currency fluctuations 
given the fact that the company transacts business in many different currencies  adverse declines in certain currencies can sometimes be offset by favorable advances in other currencies 
the company transacts business in approximately twenty seven currencies in fiscal year  approximately twenty three in fiscal year  and approximately twenty three in fiscal the relative currency mix over the past three years was as follows year ended june  of reported revenues june exchange rates revenues by currency united states dollar european euro british pound sterling australia dollar japanese yen all other currencies total calculated using average exchange rates for the year 
average weighted twelve month exchange rates for all other currencies 
the company has evaluated the impact of a change  both upward and downward  of the euro in relation to the us dollar 
a increase in the value of the euro in relation to the us dollar versus the euro would  in fiscal year  have increased annual revenues by approximately million or  while a decline in the value of the euro in relation to the us dollar would  in fiscal year  have reduced annual revenues by approximately million or 
this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact of exchange rate changes on either cost of sales  operating expenses  or income taxes and accordingly  is not necessarily an indicator of the impact of potential exchange rate changes on net income 
additionally  the company is subject to interest rate fluctuations in foreign countries to the extent that the company elects to borrow in the local foreign currency 
in the past  this has not been an issue of concern as the company has the capacity to elect to borrow in other currencies with more favorable interest rates 
while the company has not to date invested in financial instruments designed to protect against interest rate fluctuations  the company will continue to evaluate the need to do so in the future 
further  the company s committed line of credit bears interest at a floating rate of interest 
the company does not invest in financial instruments designed to protect against interest rate fluctuations  although it will continue to evaluate the need to do so in the future 
finally  the company is subject to political risk  due in part to the instability in various areas of the world including the middle east and worldwide threat of terrorism  especially in developing countries with uncertain or unstable political structures or regimes 
contributing to this risk factor is the adverse impact that political instability has on the travel and tourism industries 
the company is also subject to the effects of and changes in  laws and regulations  other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations 
patents the company holds one through its jtech subsidiary  and is currently applying for patents on certain technologies developed in its operations 
in general  the company believes that  historically  its competitive position has not been materially dependent upon patent protection 
the technology used in the design and manufacture of most of the company s hardware products is largely licensed or purchased from third parties 
with respect to the company s software products  it historically has relied on nondisclosure agreements and applicable us and foreign copyright and trademark laws for protection 
in the us and in most other countries  it is believed that both statutory and common law has provided and will continue to provide the company with sufficient protection 
there are risks that third party entities  including competitors  could attempt to misappropriate the company s intellectual property 
given these potential risks  the company has implemented procedures to monitor misappropriation of its intellectual property 
if a misappropriation is detected  the company will pursue appropriate legal action 
fluctuations and customers the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future depending upon various factors  including the timing of new product introductions  changes in the pricing and promotion policies of the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products and the capital expenditure budgets of its customers 
political uncertainty and world turmoil  created by unpredictable factors  eg  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  and the volatile and unpredictable political climate in the middle east  will continue to adversely impact travel and tourism and therefore the company s quarterly operating results 
moreover  the company has experienced increased seasonality of its business  given the significant volume of international sales 
in particular  with the european summer holidays  the company generally experiences lower sales volume in the first fiscal quarter relative to other quarters 
the company also experiences a stronger than average sales volume in the second fiscal quarter due to the holiday season for the retail products and services 
additionally  with the relative slowdown in corporate buying at the beginning of the calendar year  which is micros s third fiscal quarter  seasonal weakness for the third quarter ending march has been experienced 
therefore  the company believes that quarter to quarter historic comparisons of its results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
no single customer accounts for or more of the company s consolidated revenues  nor is any material portion of the company s business subject to renegotiation of profits at the election of the us federal government 
in fiscal years and  the company was party  directly and indirectly  to certain contracts with the us federal government  which such contracts contained standard termination for convenience clauses 
in fiscal years and the company s us government related revenue was approximately and  respectively 
the company does not anticipate any material adverse financial impact if the us government elected to exercise its rights under termination for convenience clause 
environmental matters the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws and does not anticipate that environmental compliance will have a material effect on its future capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position with respect to any of its operations 
backlog the company generally has a backlog of approximately two months revenue  substantially all of which is cancelable at any time before shipment 
as of june   and  the backlog totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
historically only an immaterial portion of the backlog existing as of the first day of the fiscal year is not recognized in such fiscal year 
business and investment risks  information relating to forward looking statements given the factors below  there remains uncertainty as to whether the company can enjoy revenue or profitability growth in the next year 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that any particular level of growth is reasonable or can be achieved 
in addition  due to the always competitive nature of the market  the company continues to experience gross margin pressure on its products and service offerings  and the company does not expect any material product and service margin improvement 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sufficiently increase sales of its higher margin products  including software  to prevent future declines in the company s overall gross margin 
moreover  micros s financial results in any single quarter are dependent upon the timing and size of customer orders and the shipment of products for large orders 
large software orders from customers may account for more than an insignificant portion of earnings in any quarter 
the customers with whom micros does the largest amount of business are expected to vary from year to year as a result of the timing of the roll out of each customer s system 
furthermore  if a customer delays or accelerates its delivery requirements or a product s completion is delayed or accelerated  revenues expected in a given quarter may be deferred or accelerated into subsequent or earlier quarters 
the market price of micros common stock is volatile  and may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in micros s quarterly operating results and other factors  eg  announcements of technological developments or new products by micros  customer roll outs  technological advances by existing and new competitors  and general market conditions in the hospitality and retail industries 
in addition  conditions in the stock market in general and shares of technology companies in particular have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of companies 
certain statements contained herein not based on historical facts are forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that involve risks and uncertainties 
examples of such forward looking statements include the statements in item  business  regarding anticipated expansion of our arrangement with mci regarding our frankfurt data center and the termination of our manufacturing relationship with sci  in item  properties  regarding the anticipated availability of additional space  in item  legal proceedings  regarding the likely effect of litigation on our results of operations or financial position  in a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and item  business  regarding the anticipated impact of fluctuations in interest rates and in currency exchange rates  and in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading liquidity and capital resources that the company s sources of cash are sufficient to provide the working capital needs of the company for the next months and that fiscal property  plant and equipment expenditures are expected to be approximately million higher than in fiscal past performance is not necessarily a strong or reliable indicator of future performance 
actual results could differ materially from past results  estimates  projections  or forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  micros 
primary risks are disclosed in the company s press releases and periodic sec filings 
some of the additional risks and uncertainties include the following weakness in the hospitality and tourism industries as a result of the ever present threat of terrorist attacks as most recently experienced in the london subway attacks of july  and july  and the uncertain political situation in the middle east and parts of asia  environmental and health disasters  including the tsunami disaster in asia and katrina  the hurricane that devastated parts of louisiana and mississippi in september environmental and health crises have a material and adverse impact on the company s business  as not only is there a material reduction in tourism for the pendency of the crises  but there is a mid term adverse impact on the buying patterns of the customers located in the affected areas  potentially unfavorable adverse economic conditions arising from the us involvement in iraq and war on terrorism this is especially true in the hospitality and tourism industry  where geo political instability has a material adverse impact 
given the adverse impact on the travel and hospitality industry as a result of the iraqi situation  micros has experienced delays in certain purchases 
there can be no guarantee that this slow down will be only short term  micros s actions in connection with the continued and increasing price and product competition in many product areas  principally hardware both proprietary hardware and hardware that micros resells  and the pressure on profit margins for those items  difficulties or delays in the development  production  testing and marketing of products  including a failure to deliver new products and technologies when scheduled  announced or generally anticipated  the failure of customers to accept these products or technologies when planned  any defects in products  micros s inability to differentiate its products  and a failure of manufacturing efforts  whether internal or through micros s third party manufacturing entities  the inherent difficulties in accurately forecasting buying patterns especially since more than an insignificant portion of the business is not major account business that cannot be easily predicted  and appropriately staffing and preparing for fluctuations in buying demand  implementation and operation of a cost effective service structure capable of servicing increasingly complex software systems in more remote locations  additional costs and expenses associated with servicing and supporting open systems  which generally incorporate third party software products the support and service of which may be more difficult and costly  difficulty in operating  maintaining and repairing centrally hosted systems  such as central reservation and centrally hosted property management systems  and centrally hosted reporting systems such as mymicros 
net  unanticipated manufacturing  supply  service or labor difficulties experienced by micros s vendors  including those that may result in a disruption or discontinuation of the services or products provided to micros  or difficulties in the manufacturing relationship certain of the facilities where micros products are manufactured may have union workers who may participate in work slow downs or stoppages  unanticipated quality or production difficulties at ges  micros s supplier of its workstation hardware pos terminal  and the soon to be released hardware platform  the technological risks of large customer rollouts  especially where the deployments involve newer technology or third party software  and installations where the customer contracts with micros to provide  the ability to respond quickly and cost effectively to the introduction of new technologies  including internet based technologies  because almost half of micros s sales are outside the us  micros s results could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in countries in which it does business  and emerging markets in which there tend to be significant growth  and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries  adverse fluctuations in foreign currencies in particular  the euro and pound  each of which constitutes a currency in which material amounts of business are transacted  ongoing economic and political turmoil and instability in countries where micros maintains a direct sales and service presence  including  for example  argentina and brazil  the ability of micros to recruit and retain qualified accounting and auditing staff  the failure of which could result in excessive third party accounting and auditing costs and expenses in connection with compliance with the sarbanes oxley legislation  including section thereof  the ability of micros to recruit and retain engineers and other highly skilled personnel  although micros attempts to protect its proprietary technology through a combination of trade secrets  copyright  trademark law  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures  these protections will not preclude competitors from developing products with features similar to micros s products  the costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings  settlements and investigations  claims  and changes in those items  and developments or assertions by or against micros relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses  the effects of  and changes in  laws and regulations  other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations  insofar as legislative change can affect local operations and the features that may have to be incorporated into the company s software sets  managing expenses  including those over which the company exercises little or no control  such as health care costs and compliance with new legislation  unanticipated taxation issues  including the imposition of tariffs by the wto and other governing bodies in an effort to deter or penalize us imports 
finally  there are ongoing legal risks to which the company is subject  some of which are difficult to predict  expect or assess 
two such legal risks are as follows alleged patent infringement on occasion  micros will receive unsolicited letters from entities which offer a license to a patent  and sometimes go as far as to suggest that micros may be infringing the patent 
in those instances  micros will assess the validity of the claims and the purported patent  and determine whether a license is appropriate or necessary 
if micros concludes that a license is not necessary  there is a risk that micros could be subject to legal action 
as of september   there is no such pending legal action 
recently  however  hundreds of merchants throughout the country  some of which license software products from micros and datavantage  have received patent licensing letters from an alleged patent holder in connection with credit card transaction processes 
the alleged patent holder has pursued litigation against several of these merchants  one of which to date is a customer of micros 
while micros strongly believes that its technology does not infringe the patent of the above alleged patent holder  micros may incur costs in defense of these matters  or other patent matters 
credit card fraud 
credit card issuers have promulgated credit card security guidelines in their ongoing effort to battle credit card fraud 
micros continues to work with credit card issuers to assure that its products comply with these security guidelines 
there can be no assurances  however  that the micros products are invulnerable to unauthorized access or hacking 
additionally  there can be no guarantee that micros s customers implement all of the credit card security features which micros has introduced  or that the customer maintains the appropriate level of firewall protection 
when there is unauthorized access to credit card data which results in loss  there is the potential that parties could seek damages from micros 
currently  there is no litigation in which damages have been sought from micros in connection with credit card fraud 
however  micros has received a demand for payment where a customer incurred an alleged loss in connection with credit card theft 
micros believes it has no liability in this instance  and in any event  the alleged loss is not material

critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those that impact revenue recognition and those related to capitalized software  intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for obsolescence  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue consists of software license revenue  hardware revenue  and service revenue 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop 
software license revenue  hardware revenue and service support revenue are generally recognized when the four basic criteria of sop are met as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the company considers a contract signed by both parties of the agreement or a purchase order received from the customer persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered delivery occurs when media containing the licensed program is provided to a common carrier fob shipping point or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
fixed or determinable fee the company considers the license fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and is payable within twelve months of delivery 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  the company recognizes the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
the company considers service fees to be fixed or determinable if the service fee or rates for time and material contracts are not subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is probable the company performs a credit review for significant transactions at the time the arrangement is executed to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if the company expects that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if the company determines that collection is not probable  revenue recognition is deferred until collection 
costs related to shipping and handling are included in cost of sales 
the company reduces revenue for estimated customer returns and allowances 
hardware hardware revenue is recognized at the time of shipment 
software if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  recognition of the software revenue is deferred until the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
in addition  if a third party can install the software  revenue is recognized when shipped  with an appropriate deferral for any undelivered software contract elements 
however  if the company is the sole party that has the proprietary knowledge to install the software  revenue is recognized upon installation and when ready to go live  with an appropriate deferral for any undelivered software contract elements 
fees are allocated to the various elements of software license agreements using the residual method prescribed by sop  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe of fair value for our services including maintenance agreements are based upon separate sales of those arrangements  which are consistently applied 
under the residual method  the company defers revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue when the basic criteria in sop are met 
typically  payments for software licenses are due within twelve months of the agreement date 
when software license agreements call for escalating payment terms  or payment terms of twelve months or more from the delivery date  software revenue is recognized as payments become due and only if all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
service service revenue consists of maintenance support  installation revenue and customer specific development work 
maintenance support is initially recorded as deferred service revenue and is recognized ratably over the contract term 
installation services  which include project management  systems planning  design and implementation  customer configurations  training and assistance activating our products are recognized as the work is performed 
our software is ready to use by the customer upon receipt 
while many of our customers may choose to tailor the software to fit their specific needs or require our assistance activating our programs  our implementation services do not typically involve significant customization to or development of the underlying source code 
when the company provides services deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software products licensed or the licensed software requires significant production  modification or customization  the company recognizes revenue under the completed contract method in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
once acceptance occurs  revenue is recognized for all delivered elements based on vsoe  and maintenance service revenue is deferred over the contract period 
the completed contract method of accounting is preferred over the percentage of completion method as the production cycles are usually not long term less than one year 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on customer payment practices and history  inquiries  credit reports from third parties and other financial information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
capitalized software development costs software development costs for software products to be licensed to others  incurred before establishing technological feasibility  are charged to operations and included in research and development costs 
software development costs incurred after establishing technological feasibility and purchased software costs are capitalized on a product by product basis until the product is available for general release to customers  at which time amortization begins 
annual amortization  charged to cost of sales  is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets the company evaluates long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when indicators of impairment are present  the company compares the fair value of the assets based on the undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate to the book value of the assets 
if the fair value is less than book value  the asset is impaired and an impairment loss would be recognized by the company 
the impairment loss represents the excess of book value over fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or market values if available 
finite lived purchased intangible assets are being amortized over their respective useful lives  which range from one to ten years 
the company did not recognize any impairment losses on long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets  during the last three fiscal years ended june  goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was effective for the company in fiscal year  prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets 
the company assesses whether goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
during the first quarter of its fiscal year 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its book value 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on a weighting of the income and market approaches to value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if goodwill is impaired  the company would recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
trademarks are the company s only indefinite lived purchased intangible asset 
trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing their fair value to book value 
the company estimates the fair value of trademarks using an income approach to value  and would recognize an impairment loss if the estimated fair value of a trademark is less than its book value 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if the company encounters events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill and or trademarks has been impaired 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and or trademarks is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  the company makes estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying reporting units 
the company also considers its market capitalization on the date the analysis is performed 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
if the company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which the determination is made
