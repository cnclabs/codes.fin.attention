item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements and risk factors you should read the following discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information in this form k report 
the discussions under the subheadings review of market segments and geographies below are in local currency unless indicated otherwise 
management considers local currency growth an important measure because by excluding the volatility of exchange rates  underlying volume growth is clearer 
as used below  indicates that we have rounded the relevant data up or down to the nearest one half percentage point 
dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands  unless otherwise indicated  except per share dollar amounts 
in addition  per share dollar amounts are discussed on a diluted basis 
the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on current company management expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially 
the company is subject to risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  regulatory approval and market acceptance of new technologies  changes in product mix and product pricing and in interest rates and cost of raw materials  the company s success in enforcing its patents and protecting its proprietary products and manufacturing techniques and its ability to achieve the savings anticipated from its cost reduction initiatives  global and regional economic conditions and legislative  regulatory and political developments  and domestic and international competition in the company s global markets 
business reorganization during fiscal year  the company undertook to reorganize its business structure into three underlying vertically integrated business units life sciences  comprising medical and biopharmaceuticals  aeropower  comprising aerospace and the machinery equipment portion of the current general industrial segment  and process technologies  comprising general industrial s food beverage  fuels chemicals  power generation  municipal water divisions and microelectronics 
this reorganization is continuing and management has decided to further integrate the industrial businesses aeropower and process technologies to form one vertically integrated industrial business unit 
thus  in the future the company s new structure will consist of two vertically integrated business units life sciences and industrial 
each business unit will have integrated support functions and responsibility for global manufacturing  sales and marketing  research and development  and finance functions to enable the company to better meet its customers needs and in order to achieve greater efficiencies and profit growth 
this revised organizational structure is in contrast to the former matrix organizational structure where  within each geography  these functions supported the market based part of the matrix on a shared basis as opposed to being directly vertically integrated into these business units 
it is expected that once the reorganization is complete  senior management of the company  including the company s chief executive officer  will manage the company and make key decisions about the allocation of company resources based on the two business units 
the company s sales subsidiaries will continue to sell life sciences and industrial products 
as such  overhead costs of these subsidiaries have been  and will continue to be  shared by the businesses 
since the company is in the process of changing its management approach  organizational structure  operating performance assessment and internal business unit financial reporting  a change to the manner in which the company presents segment information in its financial statements may result 
the accounting and financial reporting systems at each of the company s entities  as well as at the corporate office  are being assessed for conversion to support the strategic reorganization of the business and the requirements of management in the new structure 
additionally  certain of the internal segment financial reporting accounting principles utilized in the measurement and evaluation of the profitability of the company s business units such as the allocation of shared overhead costs are also being reassessed for consistency with the underlying reorganized structure of the business 

back to contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from estimates 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
see also the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies 
purchase accounting and goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with sfas no 
is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
there are various methods used to estimate the value of tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
there are also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the company performs goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  the company could be required to strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal years  and revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when contractual terms have been fulfilled 
long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete them 
the cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change  including anticipated losses 
such revisions could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when collection becomes doubtful 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  management reserves an amount believed to be uncollectible 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost principally on the first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
these adjustments are estimates which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
recoverability of available for sale investments other than temporary losses relating to available for sale investments are recognized in earnings when management determines that the recoverability of the cost of the investment is unlikely 
such losses could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
management considers numerous factors  on a case by case basis  in evaluating whether the decline in market value of an available for sale security below cost is other than temporary 
such factors include  but are not limited to  i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer of the investment  and iii whether the company s intent to retain the investment for the period of time is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

back to contents pension plans the company sponsors pension plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined ie  defined benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the liabilities and expense 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
pension expense associated with our defined benefit plans was  in fiscal year  which was based on a weighted average discount rate of calculated using the projected benefit obligation and a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of calculated using the fair value of plan assets 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by basis points  projected pension expense in fiscal year would have increased approximately  the discount rates used for defined benefit plans are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds in each country eg  in the eg  moody s aa or better 
if the weighted average discount rate was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased by approximately  accrued expenses and contingencies management estimates certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
the accrual requiring the most judgmental estimation relates to environmental proceedings 
environmental accruals are recorded based upon historical costs incurred and estimates for future costs of remediation and on going legal expenses which have a high degree of uncertainty 
when no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other  the low end of the range is accrued 
self insured workers compensation insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed including applied loss development factors as well as historical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
differences between estimates and assumptions and actual results could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such a determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such determination is made 

back to contents on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the act 
as of july   we have not provided deferred taxes on  of undistributed foreign subsidiaries earnings since substantially all such earnings were expected to be permanently invested in foreign operations 
the range of reasonably possible amounts  based upon law  that are being considered for repatriation due to the aforementioned provision is between zero and  the related potential range of income tax is between zero and  the extent to which we ultimately take advantage of this provision depends on a number of factors  including the manner in which funds will be utilized and the ability to obtain financing abroad 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results sales for the fiscal year increased to billion from billion in fiscal year exchange rates increased reported sales in the year by  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and to a lesser extent the british pound and japanese yen 
in local currency ie  had exchange rates not changed year over year  sales increased 
overall  pricing reduced sales by in the year and as such  the overall volume increase was 
sales in our biopharmaceuticals segment  which has benefited from strong demand in the biotechnology sector  grew in local currency in the year 
general industrial sales were up  fueled by double digit growth in our municipal water and fuels chemicals submarkets  while microelectronics sales increased 
sales in our aerospace segment were down due to the timing of large projects 
sales in our medical segment were down reflecting a weakness in our north american blood filtration business 
by geography  sales in the western hemisphere grew  driven by strong growth in biopharmaceuticals and general industrial 
these gains were partly offset by shortfalls in medical and aerospace 
sales in asia increased  with all segments contributing to this gain  with the exception of aerospace 
growth in general industrial sales in asia was particularly strong at 
in europe  sales were flat as growth in our life sciences business was offset by shortfalls in microelectronics and general industrial municipal water  machinery equipment and power generation 
we expect overall sales in local currency to grow in the mid single digit range in fiscal year for a detailed discussion of sales  refer to review of market segments and geographies 
cost of sales in the year  as a percentage of sales  was as compared to in fiscal year  reflecting the impact of increased systems business ie  which have lower gross margins as well as pricing reductions in our medical business  partly offset by savings generated from our cost reduction initiatives 
we expect cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  to improve slightly in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  improved to in fiscal year as compared to last year 
in fiscal year  savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives see discussion below and reduced bonus levels were partly offset by costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance and the ongoing vertical integration of our businesses 
foreign currency translation is estimated to have increased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately  in fiscal year excluding the impact of foreign exchange  selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales improved basis points as compared with fiscal year we continue to move forward with our cost reduction initiatives core 
at the beginning of fiscal year  we expected to achieve  in savings for the full year related to our indirect expenditure cost reduction initiatives and other initiatives that focus on our cost of manufacturing 
the majority of these savings were to be generated in the second half of fiscal year these programs generated about  in savings in the first half of fiscal year  however  in the third and fourth quarters we saw a lower rate of savings than originally expected which  coupled with price increases for steel  plastics  energy costs and freight  reduced our expected savings 
we estimate that savings generated  net of these cost increases  approximated  for the full fiscal year we are expecting continued improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal year research and development expenses decreased  in dollars and to of sales from in fiscal year fiscal year reflects spending on biotechnology products  such as chromatography  prion filters and industrial material projects 
we expect research and development expenses in dollars to increase moderately in fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded restructuring and other charges  net  of  primarily related to our core initiatives including our plans for a structure comprised of vertically integrated business units discussed above 
in addition  restructuring and other charges  net  include the write down of an investment in panacos pharmaceuticals  inc  formerly known as vi technologies  inc vitex  that was deemed other than temporarily impaired and an increase to our environmental reserves 
furthermore  restructuring and other charges  net included a charge of  related to the early extinguishment of our  private placement unsecured senior notes 
the charge represents the payment to the note holders under the make whole provision of the notes reduced by our carrying value of the notes 

back to contents in fiscal year  we recorded restructuring and other charges  net  of  the restructuring and other charges  net  reflect severance and other costs incurred as a result of the streamlining of our manufacturing operations in the united kingdom uk  japan and germany and reorganizing our medical and biosciences management structure  as well as the sale of certain manufacturing plants in germany 
additionally  restructuring and other charges  net  reflects an increase in our environmental liabilities of  principally as a result of a change in the estimated duration and costs of the remediation effort at the ann arbor  michigan facility of the company s subsidiary gelman sciences  partly offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in oiltools international and non recurring income related to a decrease of pension liabilities in germany 
the adjustment to pension liabilities was due to an over accrual of pension expense that occurred during the preceding five year period  the effect of which was not significant in any period 
the details of the charges for the years ended july   july  and august  can be found in the restructuring and other charges note accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the activity related to restructuring liabilities that were recorded in fiscal years  and severance lease termination liabilities other total original charge    utilized    other changes a balance at july    original charge   utilized   balance at july    utilized   reversal of excess reserves b other changes a balance at july  original charge c    utilized    balance at aug 
    utilized    other changes a balance at july    utilized reversal of excess reserves b other changes a balance at july  a other changes reflect translation impact 
in addition  fiscal year includes the reversal of excess restructuring accruals of  related to the fsg acquisition that were originally recorded as adjustments to goodwill in accordance with eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 

back to contents b reflects the reversal in fiscal year of excess restructuring reserves recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings in fiscal years and c includes severance and other exit costs of  and  respectively  related to fsg employees and facilities that were recorded as adjustments to goodwill in accordance with eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
net interest expense in fiscal year increased to  from  in fiscal year the increase in net interest expense reflects the impact of higher interest rates on our variable rate debt and the termination of fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps 
in addition  interest expense was affected by higher debt levels earlier this fiscal year that were partly related to the acquisition of biosepra refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis for a discussion of net and gross debt 
we expect net interest expense in fiscal year to increase approximately  compared with fiscal year the underlying tax rate ie  the tax rate on earnings before income taxes  excluding restructuring and other charges was in fiscal year  unchanged from fiscal year we expect our underlying tax rate to remain at in fiscal year net earnings in fiscal year were  or per share  compared with net earnings of  or per share in fiscal year in summary  net earnings reflect organic sales growth and an improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales offset by the impact of lower gross margins as well as increased net interest expense and restructuring and other charges  net 
we estimate that foreign currency translation added approximately cents to earnings per share in fiscal year we expect earnings per share in fiscal year to be in the range of per share 
this range includes the impact of stock compensation and the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which we estimate will cost approximately cents in earnings per share 
in light of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives  we may incur severance and other restructuring costs in fiscal year  however  because these costs are not estimable at this time  this range does not contemplate such charges 
review of market segments and geographies market segments the table below presents sales for the fiscal years ended july  and july  by market segment  including the effect of exchange rates for comparative purposes 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we implemented the first phase of our vertical integration plan by integrating our medical and biosciences divisions 
accordingly  our biosciences business  which was formerly reported under our biopharmaceutical segment  was combined with our medical segment 
segment information for prior periods has been restated to conform to the current presentation 
change exchange rate difference change in local currency medical    biopharmaceuticals    total life sciences    general industrial    aerospace    microelectronics    total industrial    total    life sciences sales in fiscal year increased compared to fiscal year life sciences represented approximately of our total sales in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year within life sciences  medical segment sales in fiscal year were down  reflecting a weakness in our blood filtration portion of the business 
the biosciences and hospital portions of our medical business were up slightly 
medical sales in europe and asia were up in both geographies  while sales in the western hemisphere  the largest portion of the medical business  were down 
within medical  sales in our blood filtration submarket were down 
the shortfall reflects a weakness in the western hemisphere which accounts for approximately of our global blood filtration business  where sales were down 
the blood bank market is highly competitive throughout the world and is characterized by various national and private tender processes 
the contract with our largest blood bank customer  which expired in june  was renewed for a term of three years 
our contract with another large blood bank customer will not be renewed beyond its expiration  however  we are still doing business with them as they transition to their new provider 
in biosciences  the other medical submarket  sales increased  as growth in our laboratory business was partly offset by a decline in our oem business 
overall  we expect sales in our medical segment to be up modestly in fiscal year 
back to contents biopharmaceuticals segment sales in fiscal year increased compared to fiscal year  driven by strong demand in the biotechnology sector 
systems sales increased compared with fiscal year the acquisition of biosepra and euroflow accounted for of the biopharmaceuticals sales growth in the year 
by geography  all geographies exhibited strong growth in biopharmaceuticals sales  however  growth was particularly robust in the western hemisphere  where sales increased 
the growth in the western hemisphere reflects strong demand from the biotechnology sector while europe is continuing to recover from tough market conditions related to industry consolidations and the downturn in the plasma market 
the significant growth in systems sales in fiscal year bodes well for future sales of our disposable products 
we expect sales in the biopharmaceuticals segment to increase in the double digit range in fiscal year our industrial business accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal year as compared with in fiscal year industrial sales grew in fiscal year  as growth in general industrial and microelectronics was partly offset by a decline in aerospace 
general industrial segment sales  which account for about of our industrial business  were up compared with fiscal year the increase in sales in our general industrial segment was driven by double digit growth in our municipal water and fuels chemicals submarkets 
within general industrial  municipal water sales grew driven by repeat orders from existing municipal customers 
also  our success rate for winning municipal project bids has significantly improved as a result of our cost savings initiatives 
municipal water sales in asia almost tripled  as water scarcity is driving growth in this region 
sales in the western hemisphere increased driven by tighter epa regulations 
sales in europe were down partly due to timing of projects in the municipal sector 
overall  orders were strong in the fourth quarter as well  increasing 
sales in our fuels chemicals submarket grew driven by double digit growth rates in all geographies 
the growth in this market reflects energy availability concerns and environmental pressures 
sales in our power generation submarket increased 
by geography  sales in asia were up 
sales in the western hemisphere and europe were down and  respectively  reflecting timing of large systems sales 
sales in our machinery equipment submarket decreased 
by geography  strong growth in the western hemisphere and asia was offset by a decline in europe of 
sales growth in asia was driven by increased activity in the steel industry in china and in the mining industry in australia 
food beverage sales increased 
by geography  asia achieved double digit growth reflecting our success in the regional brewing market 
sales in the western hemisphere were down  while sales in europe were flat 
overall  we expect sales in the general industrial segment  to increase in the high single digit range in fiscal year aerospace sales were down reflecting the timing of large projects in the military and marine water portion of this business 
by geography  overall aerospace sales in the western hemisphere were down  while sales in europe were flat 
in asia  the smallest of our aerospace markets  sales were down 
military sales decreased compared to last year reflecting shortfalls in the western hemisphere and asia of and  respectively 
military sales in europe were up 
commercial sales increased reflecting growth in the western hemisphere and europe 
military comprised of total aerospace sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal we are seeing further positive signs in the commercial market in the western hemisphere and asia 
our oem airframe customers are increasing their production plans and global air travel has shown double digit growth 
we expect our military portion of the business to improve as well 
we expect sales in the aerospace segment  to increase in the mid single digit range in fiscal year microelectronics sales in fiscal year were up reflecting growth in the western hemisphere and asia 
in europe  sales were down as there is continued malaise blanketing the industry there 
on a positive note  we have seen some rebound in the oem market in the western hemisphere compared to a year ago 
the thin film rigid disk market remains strong due to the rapid adoption of micro drive enabled mp players  accordingly  we are pursuing this market 
we continue to diversify and expand into the macroelectronics market  which is not directly tied to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry 
we expect sales in the microelectronics segment  to increase in the mid single digit range in fiscal year the consolidated operating profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year operating profit dollars increased by  or  to  the operating profit details for the years ended july  and july  can be found in the segment information and geographies note accompanying the consolidated financial statements

operating profit dollars increased  or 
within life sciences  medical operating profit improved to from in fiscal year operating profit dollars increased  or 
the improvement in operating profit reflects the impact of our cost reduction programs  particularly with manufacturing efficiencies partly offset by the impact of pricing pressures 
operating profit in biopharmaceuticals was of sales as compared to in fiscal year  reflecting the impact of increased systems sales  which carry a lower margin 
operating profit dollars increased  or  generated by the strong growth in sales 
overall operating profit margins in industrial were as compared with in fiscal year operating profit dollars were down from fiscal year primarily reflecting a decreased level of profitability in our aerospace segment 
within industrial  general industrial operating profit was as compared to in fiscal year the decline in margin was primarily attributable to the significant growth in systems sales in the period 
operating profit dollars increased  or reflecting the growth in sales partly offset by the impact of reduced margins related to a change in product mix 
aerospace operating profit was as compared to in fiscal year  while operating profit dollars declined by  or  reflecting lower military and marine water sales 
microelectronics operating profit margin was  up basis points from fiscal year operating profit dollars increased  or  reflecting the growth in sales

sales in our medical segment were up in the low single digit range 
biopharmaceuticals segment sales were flat  while general industrial segment sales posted low single digit growth 
by geography  asia reported double digit sales growth  while the western hemisphere achieved mid single digit growth 
the growth in asia and the western hemisphere was partly offset by a decline in sales in europe  primarily attributable to lower aerospace sales 
for a detailed discussion of sales  refer to review of market segments and geographies 
cost of sales in fiscal year  as a percentage of sales  increased to from in fiscal year the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  reflects the impact of product mix as well as volume changes in our aerospace segment and the impact of a pricing decrease in our medical segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal year decreased to as compared to in fiscal year the improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects synergies achieved related to our fsg integration efforts and the effects of our cost reduction programs  partly offset by increased pension and consulting costs as well as the impact of foreign exchange 
foreign exchange is estimated to have increased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately  in fiscal year the increase in consulting costs relates primarily to our cost reduction programs as well as sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives 
we continued to move forward with our four cost reduction initiatives 
net savings from the indirect expenditure cost reduction initiative approximated  in fiscal year  in the western hemisphere 
research and development expenses were of sales in fiscal year  on par with fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded restructuring and other charges  net  of  the restructuring and other charges  net  reflect severance and other costs incurred as a result of the streamlining of our manufacturing operations in the united kingdom uk  japan and germany and reorganizing our medical and biosciences management structure  as well as the sale of certain manufacturing plants in germany 
additionally  restructuring and other charges  net  reflects an increase in our environmental liabilities of  principally as a result of a change in the estimated duration and costs of the remediation effort at the ann arbor  michigan facility of the company s subsidiary gelman sciences  partly offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in oiltools international and non recurring income related to a decrease of pension liabilities in germany 
the adjustment to pension liabilities was due to an over accrual of pension expense that occurred during the preceding five year period  the effect of which was not significant in any period 
in fiscal year  we recorded restructuring and other charges of  reflecting the write off of in process research and development acquired in the fsg acquisition of  and restructuring and other charges of  primarily severance and other exit costs 
the fiscal year charges were primarily related to the fsg acquisition and the realignment of our life sciences business  including the transfer of medical manufacturing from ireland 
the details of the charges for the years ended july  and august  can be found in the restructuring and other charges note accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
net interest expense decreased  compared to fiscal year the reduction in net interest expense reflects lower debt levels from our pay down of debt of about  in fiscal year the underlying tax rate was compared with in fiscal year reflecting increased earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions 
net earnings in fiscal year were  or per share  compared with net earnings of  or cents per share in fiscal year in summary  net earnings benefited from organic sales growth  increased gross profit dollars generated by a higher level of sales  decreased interest expense and the benefit of foreign exchange rates 
an increase in selling  general and administrative expense dollars pension and consulting related to the cost reduction program and sarbanes oxley initiatives and the impact of a higher underlying tax rate partly offset the above 
in addition  fiscal year included restructuring and other charges  net  of  whereas fiscal year included the write off of in process research and development acquired in the fsg acquisition of  and severance and other charges of  we estimate that foreign currency translation added approximately cents to earnings per share in fiscal year

the range of reasonably possible amounts  based upon law  that are being considered for repatriation due to the aforementioned provision is between zero and  the related potential range of income tax is between zero and  the extent to which we ultimately take advantage of this provision depends on a number of factors  including the manner in which funds will be utilized and the ability to obtain financing abroad

another significant change in practice under sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risks relate to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the sensitivity analyses presented below assume simultaneous shifts in each respective rate  and quantify the impact on our earnings and cash flows 
the changes used for these analyses reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
actual changes that differ from the changes used for these analyses could yield materially different results 
foreign currency our reporting currency is the us dollar 
because we operate through subsidiaries or branches in over thirty countries around the world  our earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
we estimate that foreign exchange translation added cents to earnings per share in fiscal year most of our products are manufactured in the us  including puerto rico  germany and the united kingdom  and then sold into many countries 
the primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the us dollar to the british pound the pound  the japanese yen the yen and the euro  as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the pound to the euro 
exposure exists when the functional currency of the buying subsidiaries weakens against the us dollar  the pound or the euro thus causing an increase of the product cost to the buying subsidiary  which adversely affects the company s consolidated gross margin and net earnings 
the effect of foreign exchange is partially mitigated because of the significant level of manufacturing done in europe 
the deterioration of the yen against the us dollar has a greater proportional adverse effect on our earnings because the majority of japan s purchases are sourced from the us in fiscal year  the euro  the pound and the yen appreciated by approximately  and  respectively  against the us dollar compared with the average exchange rates in effect in fiscal year additionally  the euro appreciated against the pound by approximately 
due to the difficulty in estimating the economic effect of foreign currency rates  particularly in periods of high volatility of such rates  we do not provide such estimated effects and report only the translation effect to earnings per share disclosed above 
we are also exposed to transaction risk from adverse changes in exchange rates 
these short term transaction exposures are primarily yen  euro  pound  singapore dollar and australian dollar denominated receivables held in the us and euro denominated receivables held in the united kingdom 
these short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are managed by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts forwards to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables as well as the expeditious payment of balances 
in addition  we enter into loans denominated in foreign currencies to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables 
we do not enter into forwards for trading purposes 
at july   these exposures amounted to approximately  and were offset by forwards with a notional principal amount of  if a hypothetical simultaneous adverse change had occurred in exchange rates  net earnings would have decreased by approximately  or approximately cent per share 

back to contents interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to our financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash and certain short term  highly liquid investments considered to be cash equivalents 
our debt portfolio is comprised of both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
we manage the composition of the portfolio  and concurrently interest rate exposure by employing interest rate swaps 
giving effect to interest rate swaps  the company s debt portfolio was approximately variable rate at july   down from approximately variable rate at july  the impetus for this change was management s reevaluation and reassessment of the interest rate environment which led to the early termination of pay variable receive fixed interest rate swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of  related to the  private placement senior notes due in as of july   we had cash flow interest rate swaps ie  variable to fixed rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating  outstanding 
the fair value of our interest rate swaps at july  was a liability of the cash flows on the above mentioned interest rate swaps mirror the cash flows of the hedged underlying debt instruments 
we do not enter into interest rate swaps for trading purposes 
for the year ended july   interest expense  net of interest income  was  a hypothetical increase in market interest rates over the actual fiscal year average rate would increase net interest expense by
