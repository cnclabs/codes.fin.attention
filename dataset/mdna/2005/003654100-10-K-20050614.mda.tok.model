these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below under risk factors as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of medical products designed to safely and effectively assist  recover or replace the pumping function of the failing heart 
our abiocor implantable replacement heart  the world s first battery powered implantable replacement heart system  was submitted to the fda for limited commercial approval under an hde in september the fda has subsequently announced that it will convene a special expert panel of cardiovascular surgeons and cardiologists on june  to review and potentially recommend approval for the groundbreaking technologies and clinical trial data behind the abiocor 
the abiocor  the development of which follows decades of fundamental and applied research  development and testing  is intended to extend life and provide an improved quality of life for end stage acute and chronic heart failure patients 
we currently manufacture and sell two models of our temporary heart assist product 
the bvs biventricular support system was the first device approved by the fda as a bridge to recovery device for temporary treatment of all patients with failing but potentially recoverable hearts 
the bvs system has an installed base of approximately consoles located in approximately medical centers in the united states  including of all medical centers that perform more than heart surgeries annually 
the bvs system has also been placed in more than medical centers outside the united states  primarily in europe 
in marketing the bvs  we are focusing on providing disposable blood pumps to existing customers 
our newer ab circulatory support system is a heart assist product model  designed to provide enhanced patient mobility within and between centers  to facilitate patient ambulation  and to provide enhanced features and ease of use for caregivers 
in april  we introduced the ab console  a new console that will serve as a platform for ongoing and future blood pump product line enhancements to meet patient needs across a broader spectrum of temporary heart assist applications 
in september we received fda approval to market the ab ventricle  the first of these new blood pumps 
ab marketing efforts were initially focused on introducing the system in the largest cardiothoracic surgical centers through sales of consoles and sales of blood pumps 
moving forward  we are focusing on upgrading the bvs installed base to the ab console  enabling more centers to benefit from the flexibility and upgradeability of the computer based ab console 
the bvs and ab systems each consist of single use external blood pumps and cannulae and a reusable pneumatic drive and control console 
both are capable of assuming the full pumping function of a patient s failing heart  and are designed to provide either univentricular or biventricular support 
both are currently approved by the fda for temporary use while the patient s heart is allowed to rest  heal and recover 
the ab console is capable of controlling both the bvs and the ab blood pumps  and incorporates upgradeable software features to accommodate future product line enhancements  while the bvs console supports only the bvs blood pump 
it is our intent to seek expansion of the current approved indications for use of the ab in order to allow support of expanded patient populations for longer periods of support 
on may   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of impella cardiosystems ag impella  a privately held company located in aachen  germany 
accordingly  the operating results of impella from may  will be included in the company s results beginning with the first quarter of fiscal impella manufactures and sells small  minimally invasive  high performance micro blood pumps with integrated motors and sensors for use in interventional cardiology and heart surgery 
these pumps are designed to provide left ventricle support for patients suffering from reduced cardiac output and can potentially aid in recovering the hearts of patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction ami or heart attack  including those who have gone into cardiac shock 
impella has ce marks for each of its devices and currently markets them throughout europe 
we intend to seek fda approval to sell the impella recover system blood pumps in the united states in order to address wider market opportunities for cardiac assist and recovery 
abiomed acquired impella in exchange for approximately million in cash and  shares of abiomed common stock  of which  shares are to be held in escrow for potential claims for indemnification by the company pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement 
the  shares of abiomed common stock have a fair value of million 
accordingly  the purchase price before contingent payments will be million  inclusive of approximately million of acquisition costs 
in addition  the agreement provides that abiomed may make additional contingent payments to impella s former shareholders based on the company s future stock price performance and additional milestone payments related to fda approvals and unit sales of impella products 
these contingent payments range from zero dollars to approximately million and will be made in a combination of cash or stock  if at all 
the company has not yet determined the preliminary purchase price allocation due to the recent nature of the acquisition 
however  management believes that more than half of the purchase price will be recorded to goodwill  and a write off of in process research and development will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal also  significant amortization of intangible assets will impact fiscal and future results 
research and development is a significant portion of our operations 
our research and development efforts are focused on the development of new products related to heart assist  heart recovery and heart replacement  and the continued enhancement of current technologies 
one such effort is the abiocor ii  a smaller replacement heart incorporating a pumping mechanism different from that of the abiocor that is currently undergoing animal testing 
our operating results reflect the dual activities of commercial operations and investments in the research and development of new technologies 
critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuations and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab establishes the sec s view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
further  sab requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized 
we believe that our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sab we derive our revenues from two principal sources product sales  including maintenance service agreements  and funded research and development contracts and grants from government and other third party sources 
the great majority of our product revenues are derived from our shipment of bvs and ab products to fulfill customer orders for a specified number of consoles and or blood pumps for a specified price 
we recognize revenues and record costs related to such sales upon product shipment 
during the three years ending march  a declining percentage of our bvs product revenue was derived from extended term contracts with certain of our customers 
these contracts  the last of which ended in due course this past fiscal year  provided customers with units of our bvs product under contract terms of one to three years 
the company received a fixed  non refundable amount of money for providing these customers with bvs blood pumps during the term of the contract to replace those used to support patients 
in addition to sab  we followed the guidance of eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in our calculation and recognition of the relative sales value for each element of these extended term contracts 
in so doing  we recognized revenue and recorded cost of product revenues ratably over the term of the contract using an estimated per unit selling price based upon actual shipments of pumps to customers compared to the maximum number of additional pumps allowable under the contract 
when a maximum number of pumps was not specified in the sales contract  we compared actual shipments to our estimate of additional pumps that might be required by the customer 
in the majority of contracts that contained contractual limits on the number of pumps  customers did not use the maximum number of allowable pumps and  as a result  we recognized the remaining deferred revenue at the end of the contract term with no associated incremental cost 
cash received in advance of revenue in connection with the sale of blood pumps under extended term contracts is recorded as deferred revenue and is classified as a current or long term liability depending on the expected shipment dates of the blood pumps 
maintenance service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract 
government sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
revenues from these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
under contracts in which the company elects to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract than the total contract amount  the company prospectively recognizes revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as it incurs related research and development costs  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
warranties 
our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and product recalls 
our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of product failures  including product recalls  exceeds our estimated warranty provision 
inventories 
we value our inventory of products held for sale at the lower of cost or current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down to its net realizable value any inventory believed to be impaired 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than projected demand  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely impact financial results for the period in which the additional excess or obsolete inventory is identified 
the inventory balances at march  and march   are net of accumulated impairment write downs of  and  respectively 
all of our inventories are related to our heart assist product line 
we will not capitalize any costs related to abiocor inventory until we receive regulatory approval to begin commercial sales 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  as of march   the company had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  that begin to expire in the company also has federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  that begin to expire in we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as an offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that the company will be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax benefit  an adjustment to deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues which includes revenues from products and funded research and development year ended march  revenues products funded research and development total revenues costs and expenses cost of product revenues research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses loss from operations other income  net net loss fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal product revenues 
product revenues increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the improvement is attributable to increased sales of both our ab consoles and ventricles and our bvs disposable blood pumps 
a majority of the increased product sales were derived from our delivering a record number of ab systems and reorder ventricles during the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the product continuing to gain market acceptance as patient outcomes continued to improve with its wider use 
higher average unit selling prices for both products also contributed to approximately half the increased revenue performance during the past fiscal year 
our european subsidiary  abiomed bv  set a company record for revenues during the fiscal year ending march  by increasing product revenues by  or million  over the prior year 
international product revenue from sources outside of europe also increased by during the fiscal year ended march  as a result of our efforts to establish and strengthen international distribution channels 
of the million in product revenues for the fiscal year ended march   approximately was derived from sales of ab ventricles and bvs disposable blood pumps 
as of march   we have a sales backorder and deferred revenues of approximately million  primarily as a result of our multi year customer service support contracts 
international sales accounted for of total product revenue during the fiscal years ended march  and going forward  we expect our core legacy products to generate revenue growth of during our fiscal year ending march   in addition to sales of impella product sales of approximately million in europe 
we also expect that the bvs will remain an important part of our heart assist product portfolio  as we anticipate continuing demand for bvs blood pumps 
funded research and development revenues 
during recent years our efforts to obtain government research and development contracts and grants have been limited  as a result of directing our technical personnel and other resources towards development and commercialization of existing technology 
as a result  externally funded research and development revenue decreased by million  or  from million during the fiscal year ended march  to million during the fiscal year ended march  as of march   our total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was million 
all of these contracts and grants contain provisions that make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
cost of product revenues 
our cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenue improved for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was for fiscal compared to in fiscal approximately of the improvement in margin is the result of higher average unit selling prices for our ab and bvs pumps in comparison to the prior fiscal year with the remainder in improvement coming from increased productivity in our manufacturing processes 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal research and development expenses were of total revenues for fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal the decrease is primarily as a result of shifting our labor and other costs to commercial bvs and ab manufacturing activities offset by increased development efforts on potential new products 
we expect research and development expenses to increase year over year as we invest in the development of new products in circulatory care to be introduced in the market in the next to months 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in the prior year to million in fiscal year ended march  the increases are primarily the result of labor  recruiting and relocation expenses incurred in connection with our adding new senior management earlier this fiscal year and expenses in connection with the sarbanes oxley compliance 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses increased significantly as a result of our efforts to expand our commercial operations both domestically and internationally 
other income 
other income consists primarily of interest earned on our investment balances  net of expenses and foreign exchange gains or losses 
other income was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to interest income representing better yields on investments offset by a reduction of the foreign translation gain 
net loss 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  or per share 
this is a reduction from the net loss of approximately million  or per share  in the prior fiscal year 
fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal product revenues 
product revenues increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is attributable to sales of ab consoles and ventricles during the controlled clinical rollout that began in the first fiscal quarter for the console and in the second fiscal quarter for the ventricle 
product revenue reflects fulfillment of all of the sales backlog reported at the end of our third fiscal quarter 
going forward  we expect total revenue growth in excess of annually driven by sales of ab consoles and ventricles subsequent to the full product rollout in april revenue growth may be concentrated in the second half of fiscal we also expect that the bvs will remain an important part of our heart assist product portfolio  as we anticipate continuing demand for bvs blood pumps 
domestic sales accounted for of total product revenue during fiscal and of product revenue for fiscal funded research and development revenues 
contract revenues increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as of march   our total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was million 
all of these contracts and grants contain provisions that make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues improved to for fiscal from in fiscal the improvement in margin is primarily the result of lower manufacturing costs  increased sales as a result of the introduction of the new ab system  and a write down of inventory of an older model of the bvs console to its net realizable value in the prior year 
we expect that the growth of ab product revenues will support continued margin improvement in future reporting periods 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal research and development expenses were of total revenues for fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal the largest portion of this decrease is attributable to research and development expenses incurred for the abiocor  which decreased by million from million for fiscal to million during fiscal these abiocor reductions are primarily due to labor and material purchases related to manufacture of abiocor units as well as development and testing activities 
research and development expense for fiscal also included costs associated with ongoing development of the ab  including costs associated with efforts to obtain regulatory approval for our new ab ventricle as well as those associated with future heart assist blood pumps and cannulae that are expected to operate with the new ab platform 
also included in research and development expense during fiscal are lesser costs associated with continued development and testing of the abiocor ii 
we anticipate that the majority of our near term research and development focus will be on further extending the ab product line  completing the initial abiocor clinical trial and securing approval of a humanitarian device exemption for initial commercial introduction of the abiocor  and developing the abiocor ii 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  from million in the prior year to million in fiscal year ended march  this reduction is attributable to lower accounting and legal costs as well as reductions in selling and clinical support costs 
as we plan to increase both sales and clinical support staffing in order to support the ongoing rollout of the ab product  selling and clinical support costs are likely to increase going forward 
throughout fiscal we incurred certain expenses associated with business development activities  primarily related to the review of business opportunities related to rotary blood pump technologies 
these activities may continue in the coming year and beyond  and may be expanded to encompass a wider array of different business opportunities clustered around our existing mechanical circulatory support business 
if these activities were to result in a major new business initiative  it is possible that we would decide to seek new financing in order to support that initiative 
in april david m 
lederman  phd  abiomed s founder  stepped down as president and chief executive officer and was succeeded in those positions by michael r 
minogue 
dr 
lederman remains chairman of the board and an employee of the company 
subsequent to our fiscal year ending march   abiomed s management team has been strengthened by a number of new appointments to fill existing vacancies and or newly defined senior management functions 
we have incurred one time costs associated with recruitment and or relocation of mr 
minogue and these new senior personnel  much of which will be recorded in the company s fiscal year ending march  other income 
other income consists primarily of interest earned on our investment balances  net of expenses and foreign exchange gain or loss 
interest and other income was million in fiscal  a decrease of million from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reduced yields on investments resulting from lower average interest rates and lower average fund balances available for investment 
as a result of our improving financial performance and the continuing reduction in research and development expenditures as the abiocor approaches initial commercial introduction  we were able during fiscal to move some of our cash and short term assets into longer term instruments in order to improve future yields 
foreign translation costs were nearly constant year to year 
net loss 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  or per share 
this is a reduction from the net loss of approximately million  or per share  in the prior fiscal year 
the losses for both years are primarily attributable to development and clinical testing costs associated with the abiocor  the abiocor ii  the ab circulatory assist system and costs of developing other technologies and products 
continued reduction of our net loss is an important goal of management  and we anticipate moving into profitability before the end of fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have supported our operations with net revenues from sales of our bvs and ab circulatory assist product line  government contracts and proceeds from our equity offerings 
as of march   our cash  cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term investments totaled million 
during the year our financial performance from business operations  driven by higher product revenues  resulted in a substantial reduction in our use of cash 
during the fiscal year ended march   cash used by operating activities was million  or  less than the million consumed by operations in the comparable period of the prior year 
there was also an increase in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively as a result of the company s planned higher level of product sales 
net cash consumption from all activities  as determined by the net change in cash  short term marketable securities and long term investments  decreased to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to million consumed in the prior fiscal year 
the difference of million represents an decline in cash consumption 
during this fiscal year the company benefited from million in cash proceeds from the employee stock option exercises and employee participation in the company s stock purchase plan 
income taxes incurred during the fiscal year were not material  and we continue to have significant net tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for the next twelve months  including funding operating capital of approximately million to million for impella operations and the planned expenditures for our abiocor and abiocor ii implantable replacement hearts  and continued development and commercialization efforts of our bvs and ab circulatory assist products 
we may  however  need additional funds for possible strategic acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies complementary to our business and their subsequent integration and operating capital 
if additional funds are required  we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table in thousands summarizes our contractual obligations at march  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total and after operating lease obligations the company has no long term debt or material commitments at march  we have elected not to exercise a buyout option available under the company s primary lease that would have allowed for early termination of the lease in on may   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of impella cardiosystems ag impella  a privately held company located in aachen  germany 
accordingly  the operating results of impella from may  will be included in the company s results beginning with the first quarter of fiscal impella manufactures and sells small  minimally invasive  high performance micro blood pumps with integrated motors and sensors for use in interventional cardiology and heart surgery 
abiomed acquired impella in exchange for approximately million in cash and  shares of abiomed common stock  of which  shares are to be held in escrow for potential claims for indemnification by the company pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement 
the  shares of abiomed common stock have a fair value of million 
accordingly  the purchase price before contingent payments will be million  inclusive of approximately million of acquisition costs 
the agreement provides that abiomed may make additional contingent payments to impella s former shareholders based on the company s future stock price performance and additional milestone payments related to fda approvals and unit sales of impella products 
these contingent payments range from zero dollars to approximately million and will be made in a combination of cash or stock  if at all 
the company has not yet determined the preliminary purchase price allocation due to the recent nature of the acquisition 
however  management believes that more than half of the purchase price will be recorded to goodwill  and a write off of in process research and development will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal also  significant amortization of intangible assets will impact fiscal and future results 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation expands the disclosure requirements of guarantee obligations and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation assumed under a guarantee 
in general  fin no 
applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset  liability  or equity security of the guaranteed party 
we apply the disclosure provisions of fin to agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
these disclosure provisions expand those required by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  by requiring that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance is remote 
the following is a description of arrangements in which we are a guarantor 
product warranties the company routinely accrues for estimated future warranty costs on its product sales at the time of sale 
the ab and bvs products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates 
operating results could be adversely effected if the actual cost of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision 
patent indemnifications in many sales transactions  the company indemnifies customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by the company s products 
the indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims 
the company has never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to sales transactions 
under the provisions of fin no 
 intellectual property indemnifications require disclosure only 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
current and prospective investors should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described in this section and all of the other information in this report 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be severely harmed by any of the following risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline if any of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events 
we do not operate at a profit and cannot be assured of future profitability 
we have had net losses in each of the past three fiscal years 
we are committed to making large expenditures for our new products  including those acquired in connection with our recent acquisition of impella cardiosystems  ag  under development in fiscal and subsequent fiscal years  which may result in losses in future periods 
these expenditures include costs associated with performing clinical trials  continuing our research and development relating to our new products under development  seeking regulatory approvals and  if we receive these approvals  commencing commercial manufacturing and marketing 
the amount of these expenditures is difficult to forecast accurately  and cost overruns may occur 
we plan to fund a portion of these expenditures from our limited existing financial resources and revenues from ab  bvs and impella product sales 
we cannot be sure that we will have the necessary funds to develop and commercialize our new products  or that additional funds will be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event that we are unable to obtain the necessary funding to develop and commercialize our products  our business may be adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate unpredictably 
our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated historically and we expect these fluctuations to continue 
among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are costs we incur developing and testing the abiocor  abiocor ii and other new products or product enhancements  the timing of regulatory actions  such as product approvals or recalls  costs we incur in anticipation of future sales  such as inventory purchases  expansion of manufacturing facilities  or establishment of international sales offices  the timing of customer orders and deliveries  competitive changes  such as price changes or new product introductions that we or our competitors may make  and economic conditions in the health care industry and the state of cost containment efforts  including reimbursement policies 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical and future results will not necessarily be meaningful  and that investors should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
to the extent we experience the factors described above  our future operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors from time to time  which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the bvs and ab circulatory assist products  our principal product and current primary source of revenues  are vulnerable to competitive pressures  disruptions in sales  continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements 
all of our product revenues to date have come from sales of the bvs and ab products 
we believe that we will continue to rely heavily on these products for at least the next several years until we obtain regulatory approval for new products 
in the event that a competitor were to introduce new treatments  products and technologies which compete with our products  add new features to their existing products or reduce their prices to make their products more financially attractive to customers  our revenue from our bvs and ab products could decline 
for example  in the event of the expansion of technologies  which allow heart surgical procedures to be performed without stopping the heart  a reduction in the market for the bvs and ab products could potentially result 
further  the bvs and ab are subject to stringent and continuing fda and other regulatory requirements  including compliance with the qsr  adverse event reporting  prohibitions on promoting the products for unapproved uses  and continued inspection and market surveillance by the fda 
if our products are recalled or otherwise withdrawn from the market  our revenues would likely decline  which would hurt our business 
in addition  variations in the quantity and timing of sales of our new ab consoles have a disproportionate effect on our revenues  because the price of the console is substantially greater than the price of our disposable blood pumps 
if we cannot maintain and increase our disposable blood pump revenues from our bvs and ab product line  our overall business and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our product revenues increased in fiscal by in comparison to fiscal and in fiscal our product revenues increased by in comparison to fiscal to maintain or increase revenues from sales of our current products  we may be required to adopt new sales and marketing strategies  some of which may require expending additional capital resources  or execute on existing strategies 
the new strategies we may adopt or execute on include regularly introducing enhancements and product line extensions  product expansion within our markets through the acquisition of existing companies whose products may require additional development or clinical analysis for regulatory approval  expanding sales of our bvs and ab product line in international markets  some of which require separate regulatory approvals  and seeking new categories of patients to support with our technology platform 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in carrying out these new strategies  our revenues may decline 
we may not be successful in expanding our sales activities into international markets 
we are seeking to expand our international sales of the ab  bvs and impella recover circulatory assist systems by recruiting direct sales and support teams for selected countries in europe 
to date we have limited experience in selling our products internationally 
in fiscal and fiscal  approximately of our product revenues were derived from international sales 
our international operations will be subject to a number of risks  which may vary from the risks we experience in the us  including the need to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign countries before our products may be sold or used  longer sales cycles  dependence on local distributors  limited protection of intellectual property rights  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies  and political and economic instability 
if we are unable to effectively expand our sales activities in international markets  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we depend on third party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products 
if third party payers fail to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for purchase and use of our products  our profitability would be adversely affected 
sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers 
the cost of our ab and bvs systems is substantial  and we anticipate that the cost of implanting the abiocor in a patient will also be substantial 
without the financial support of the government or third party insurers  the market for our products will be limited 
medical products and devices incorporating new technologies are closely examined by governments and private insurers to determine whether the products and devices will be covered by reimbursement  and if so  the level of reimbursement which may apply 
we cannot be sure that third party payors will reimburse sales of our products now under development  or enable us to sell them at profitable prices 
we also cannot be sure that third party payors will continue the current level of reimbursement to physicians and medical centers for use of the bvs and ab any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business 
the federal government and private insurers have considered ways to change  and have changed  the manner in which health care services are provided and paid for in the us in the future  it is possible that the government may institute price controls and further limits on medicare and medicaid spending 
these controls and limits could affect the payments we collect from sales of our products 
internationally  medical reimbursement systems vary significantly  with some medical centers having fixed budgets  regardless of levels of patient treatment  and other countries requiring application for  and approval of  government or third party reimbursement 
even if we succeed in bringing our new products to market  uncertainties regarding future health care policy  legislation and regulation  as well as private market practices  could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices 
prior to approving coverage for new medical devices  most third party payors require evidence that the product has received fda approval  is not experimental  and is medically necessary for the specific patient 
increasingly  third party payors require evidence that the devices being used are cost effective 
the abiocor and our other products under development may not meet these or future criteria  which could hurt our ability to market and sell these products 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our products require or if we are unable to develop additional manufacturing capacity  we will not be successful 
our products require precise  high quality manufacturing 
our failure to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards  including the incidence of manufacturing errors  design defects or component failures  could result in patient injury or death  product recalls or withdrawals  delays or failures in product testing or delivery  cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business 
we have from time to time voluntarily recalled certain products 
despite our very high manufacturing standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors  defects or failures 
if we are not able to manufacture the ab  bvs and impella recover micro blood pump products in accordance with necessary quality standards  our business and results of operations may be negatively affected 
the abiocor involves even greater manufacturing complexities than our current commercial products 
the abiocor must be significantly more durable and meet different standards  which may be more difficult to achieve  than those that apply to our current product line 
if we are unable to manufacture the abiocor or other future products on a timely basis at acceptable quality and cost and in commercial quantities  or if we experience unanticipated technological problems or delays in production  our business will suffer 
the manufacture of our products is and will continue to be complex and costly  requiring a number of separate processes and components 
achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by our personnel 
further  to be successful  we believe we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity 
we may experience difficulties in scaling up manufacturing of our new products  including problems related to product yields  quality control and assurance  component and service availability  adequacy of control policies and procedures  and lack of skilled personnel 
if we cannot hire  train and retain enough experienced and capable scientific and technical workers  we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our current or future products at an acceptable cost and on time  which could limit market acceptance of our products or otherwise damage our business 
if our suppliers cannot provide the components we require  our ability to manufacture our products could be harmed 
we rely on third party suppliers to provide us with certain components used in the ab  bvs  impella recover micro blood pumps  abiocor  abiocor ii  and our other products under development 
relying on third party suppliers makes us vulnerable to component part failures and to interruptions in supply  either of which could impair our ability to conduct clinical tests or to ship our products to our customers on a timely basis 
using third party vendors makes it difficult and sometimes impossible for us to test fully certain components  such as components on circuit boards  maintain quality control  manage inventory and production schedules and control production costs 
vendor lead times to supply us with ordered components vary significantly and can exceed six months or more 
both now and as we expand our manufacturing capacity  we cannot be sure that our suppliers will furnish us with required components when we need them 
these factors could make it more difficult for us to effectively and efficiently manufacture our products  and could adversely impact our results of operations 
some suppliers may be the only source for a particular component  which makes us vulnerable to cost increases and supply interruptions 
vendors may decide to limit or eliminate sales of certain products to the medical industry due to product liability or other concerns  and we might not be able to find a suitable replacement for those products 
manufacturers of our product components may be required to comply with the fda or other regulatory manufacturing regulations and to satisfy regulatory inspections in connection with the manufacture of the components 
if we cannot obtain a necessary component  we may need to find  test and obtain regulatory approval for a replacement component  produce the component ourselves or redesign the related product  which would cause significant delay and could increase our manufacturing costs 
any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations 
we own patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property and know how that we believe gives us a competitive advantage 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  competition could force us to lower our prices  which could hurt our profitability 
our intellectual property rights are and will continue to be a critical component of our success 
a substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the ab  bvs  impella recover micro blood pumps  abiocor  abiocor ii and other products under development is in the form of trade secrets  rather than patents 
in order to preserve certain proprietary information as trade secrets  we are required to restrict disclosure of information intended to constitute trade secrets to third parties 
we protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
certain of our consultants and third parties with whom we have business relationships may also provide services to other parties in the medical device industry  including companies  universities and research organizations that are developing competing products 
in addition  some of our former employees may seek employment with  and become employed by  our competitors 
we cannot assure that confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach  or that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors 
the loss of trade secret protection for technologies or know how relating to the ab  bvs  impella recover  abiocor or abiocor ii could adversely affect our business prospects 
our business position will also depend in part on our ability to defend our existing and future patents and rights and conduct our business activities free of infringement claims by third parties 
we intend to seek additional patents  but our pending and future patent applications may not be approved  may not give us a competitive advantage  and could be challenged by others 
patent proceedings in the us and in other countries may be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  patents issued by foreign countries may afford less protection than is available under us patent law  and may not adequately protect our proprietary information 
our competitors may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes that are the same as or substantially equivalent to ours  or design around our patents 
companies in the medical device industry typically obtain patents and frequently engage in substantial intellectual property litigation 
our products and technologies could infringe on the rights of others 
if a third party successfully asserts a claim for infringement against us  we may be liable for substantial damages  be unable to sell products using that technology  or have to seek a license or redesign the related product 
these alternatives may be uneconomical or impossible 
patent litigation could be costly  result in product development delays and divert the efforts and attention of management from our business 
if we cannot attract and retain the management  sales and other personnel we need  we will not be successful 
we depend heavily on the contributions of the principal members of our business  financial  technical  sales and support  regulatory and clinical  operating and administrative management and staff  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
competition for skilled and experienced business management  scientific personnel and sales personnel in the medical devices industry is intense 
if we lose the services of any of the principal members of our management and staff  or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future  especially scientific and sales personnel  our business could be adversely affected 
we expect to grow rapidly if our products under development advance through the approval process 
the expansion of personnel and facilities will strain our management and our financial and other resources 
if we cannot manage this growth successfully  our business will likely suffer 
product liability claims could damage our reputation and hurt our financial results 
the clinical use of medical products  even after regulatory approval  poses an inherent risk of product liability claims 
we maintain limited product liability insurance coverage  subject to deductibles and exclusions 
we cannot be sure that product liability insurance will be available in the future or will be available on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs  or that such insurance will provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or potential outcome  may also hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of our products or expand our business 
many patients supported by our products do not survive 
there are many factors beyond our control that could result in patient death  including the condition of the patient prior to use of the product  the skill and reliability of physicians and hospital personnel using and monitoring the product  and product maintenance by customers 
however  the failure of the life support products we distribute for clinical test or sale could give rise to product liability claims and negative publicity 
the risk of product liability claims will increase as we introduce new products that are intended to support a patient until the end of life 
for example  the abiocor will have a finite life and could cause unintended complications to other organs and may not be able to successfully support all patients 
its malfunction could give rise to product liability claims whether or not it has extended or improved the quality of the patient s life 
we cannot be sure that we can obtain liability insurance to cover the ab  bvs  impella recover  abiocor or other new products at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if we have to pay product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
failure of our recent impella acquisition to achieve its potential benefits could harm our business and operating results 
we recently acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of impella cardiosystems ag 
the acquisition may not achieve its anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons  including problems in successfully integrating our operations  our inability to obtain fda approval and market acceptance for impella s products  problems with compatibility of business cultures  problems in successfully coordinating our research and development efforts  difficulty in integrating sales  support and product marketing  costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures  including financial accounting systems  and the inability to retain and integrate key management  research and development and customer support personnel 
further  we cannot assure you that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits and synergies of the acquisition 
any one or all of the factors identified above could cause increased operating costs  lower than anticipated financial performance  or the loss of customers  employees or business partners 
the failure to integrate impella successfully would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the substantial costs of our impella acquisition could harm our financial results 
in connection with our acquisition of impella  we incurred substantial costs 
these include fees to legal counsel  independent accountants and consultants 
we may also be required to make additional contingent payments under the terms of the acquisition  in an amount of up to  based on our future stock price performance and milestones related to fda approval and unit sales of impella s products 
if the benefits of the acquisition do not exceed the associated costs  including any dilution to our stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares of our common stock in the transaction  our financial results  including earnings per share  could suffer  and the market price of our common stock could decline 
if we acquire other companies or businesses  we will be subject to risks that could hurt our business 
in addition to our recent acquisition of impella  in the future  we may pursue additional acquisitions to obtain complementary businesses  products or technologies 
any such acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated  and an acquired business  product or technology might not perform as we expected 
if we pursue an additional acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort in identifying and completing the acquisition 
if we complete an additional acquisition  we may encounter significant difficulties and incur substantial expenses in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company into our operations while preserving the goodwill of the acquired company 
in particular  we may lose the services of key employees of the acquired company and we may make changes in management that impair the acquired company s relationships with employees and customers 
any of these outcomes could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of our additional acquisitions 
to pay for an acquisition  we might use stock or cash 
alternatively  we might borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if we use our stock  our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity would be reduced 
we may be required to capitalize a significant amount of intangibles  including goodwill  which may lead to significant amortization charges 
in addition  we may incur significant  one time write offs and amortization charges 
these amortization charges and write offs could decrease our future earnings or increase our future losses 
our rights distribution  certificate of incorporation and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and may prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on our stock 
our rights distribution and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would allow our stockholders to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our stock 
our rights distribution and those provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value 
however  such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control  which could negatively affect our stock price 
the market value of our common stock could vary significantly  based on market perceptions of the status of our development efforts 
the perception of securities analysts regarding our product development efforts could significantly affect our stock price 
as a result  the market price of our common stock has and could in the future change substantially when we or our competitors make product announcements 
many factors affecting our stock price are industry related and beyond our control 
our future success is strongly dependent on development of new assist products and implantable replacement heart devices 
our development efforts may not be successful 
we are currently devoting our major research and development and regulatory efforts  and significant financial resources  to the development of the abiocor and abiocor ii  product extensions of existing commercial products and new products  such as the impella recover and micro blood pumps  for which we expect to obtain fda approval and to market in the next twelve to eighteen months 
the development of assist and replacement heart devices such as the abiocor and abiocor ii  and other new products  presents enormous challenges in a variety of areas  many or all of which we may have difficulty in overcoming  including blood compatible surfaces  blood compatible flow  manufacturing techniques  pumping mechanisms  physiological control  energy transfer  anatomical fit and surgical techniques 
specifically  for many years  we and other parties have been attempting to develop a heart replacement device 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in our development efforts  and in the event that we are unable to commercialize the abiocor and abiocor ii  our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the markets for our products under development are unproven 
even if our products are successfully developed and approved by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities  they may not enjoy commercial acceptance or success  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
several factors could limit our success  including our need to create a market for our new products ab  abiocor  abiocor ii  impella recover and recover micro blood pumps and possible limited market acceptance among physicians  medical centers  patients and third party payers  the need for surgeons and cardiologists to develop or be trained in new surgical techniques or non invasive procedures in order to use our products effectively  limitations on the number of patients who may have access to physicians and medical centers with adequate training  equipment and personnel to make use of our products  limitations inherent in first generation devices  and the potential failure to develop successive improvements  including increases in service life  which would reduce the addressable market for our products  the lifestyle limitations that patients will have to accept  the timing and amount of reimbursement for these products  if any  by third party payers  the introduction by other companies of new treatments  products and technologies which compete with our products  and may reduce their market acceptance  or make them obsolete  the reluctance  due to ethical considerations  of physicians  patients and society as a whole to accept significant medical devices that replace or assist the heart  and the reluctance of physicians  patients and society as a whole to accept the finite life and risk of mechanical failure of devices that replace or assist the heart 
the commercial success of the ab  abiocor  abiocor ii  impella recover and micro blood pumps and other heart assist products will require acceptance by cardiovascular surgeons and interventional and heart failure cardiologists  a limited number of whom significantly influence medical device selection and purchasing decisions 
we may achieve our business objectives only if our other products are accepted and recommended by leading physicians  which is likely to be based on a determination by these physicians that our products are safe  cost effective and represent acceptable methods of treatment 
although we have developed relationships with leading cardiac surgeons and cardiologists  we cannot assure that these existing relationships and arrangements can be maintained or that new relationships will be established in support of our products 
if cardiovascular surgeons and cardiologists do not consider our products to be adequate for the treatment of our target cardiac patient population or if a sufficient number of physicians recommend and use competing products  it would seriously harm our business 
testing of our new products will involve uncertainties and risks which could delay or prevent new product introductions  require us to incur substantial additional costs or result in our failure to bring our products to market 
development and testing of design changes to the abiocor  abiocor ii  impella recover and micro blood pumps and other products under development is often extensive  expensive and time consuming 
some of the tests for our products may require months or years to perform  and we could be required to begin these tests again if we modify one of our products to correct a problem identified in testing 
even modest changes to certain components of our products can take months or years to complete and test 
if results of pre clinical or clinical testing of our products under development indicate that design changes are required  such changes could cause serious delays that would adversely affect our results of operations 
a number of companies in the medical industry have suffered delays  cost overruns and project terminations despite achieving promising results in pre clinical testing or early clinical testing 
in the event that we suffer setbacks in the pre clinical or clinical testing of our heart assist and replacement products  these products may be delayed  require further funding  and possibly may not be brought to market 
if we fail to obtain approval from the fda and from foreign regulatory authorities  we cannot market and sell the abiocor or other products in the us and in other countries 
if we cannot demonstrate through clinical testing on humans or other means that the abiocor or other new products under development and testing are safe and effective  we will not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in the us or other countries for the commercial sale of these products 
our initial clinical testing of the abiocor has been completed and the results were submitted to the fda to support our request for market approval under an hde in september the fda has subsequently announced that it will convene a special expert panel of cardiovascular surgeons and cardiologists on june  to review and potentially approve the groundbreaking technologies and clinical trial data behind the abiocor 
we cannot assure that the fda or any other regulatory authority will act quickly or favorably on our requests for this product approval  or that the fda or any other regulatory authority will not require us to provide additional data that we do not currently anticipate in order to obtain product approvals 
if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for the abiocor based on a phased approach that begins with an hde  the initial approval is likely to include conditions or limitations to particular indications that would limit the available market for these products 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use of the abiocor or our other products under development  or if the patient populations for which they are approved are not sufficiently broad  the commercial success of these products could be limited 
we intend to market the abiocor and our other new products in international markets  including the european union and japan 
we must obtain separate regulatory approvals in order to market our products in other jurisdictions 
the approval process may differ among those jurisdictions and approval in the us or in any other jurisdiction does not ensure approval in other jurisdictions 
obtaining foreign approvals could result in significant delays  difficulties and costs for us  and require additional trials and additional expense 
if we obtain regulatory approval of our new products  the products will be subject to continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements  which could affect the manufacturing and marketing of our products 
the fda continues to review products even after they have received initial approval 
if and when the fda approves the abiocor  or our other products under development  the manufacture and marketing of these products will be subject to continuing regulation  including compliance with qsr  adverse event reporting requirements and prohibitions on promoting a product for unapproved uses 
we will also be required to obtain additional approvals in the event we significantly modify the design of an approved product or the product s labeling or manufacturing process 
modifications of this type are common with new products  and we anticipate that the first generation of each of our products will undergo a number of changes  refinements and improvements over time 
for example  the current configuration of the abiocor s thoracic unit  or replacement heart  is sized for patients with relatively large chest cavities  and we anticipate that we will need to obtain regulatory approval of thoracic units of other sizes 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approval of modifications to our current and future products  the commercial success of these products would be limited 
we and our third party suppliers of product components are also subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda for qsr and other requirements 
enforcement actions resulting from failure to comply with government requirements could result in fines  suspensions of approvals  recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  and affect the manufacture and marketing of our products 
the fda could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information  including a failure to comply with regulatory requirements  the occurrence of unanticipated problems with products following approval  or other reasons  which could adversely affect our operating results 
the cost of developing and manufacturing the abiocor  abiocor ii and other planned new products acquired in connection with our acquisition of impella cardiosystems  ag  is substantial for a company of our size and might exert a strain on our available resources 
while our total research and development expenditures have decreased  spending on our abiocor  abiocor ii and other products under development or acquired in connection with our acquisition of impella cardiosystems  ag will remain significant for some time 
we expect that we will also need to make significant expenditures to begin to manufacture and market the abiocor and our other planned new products in commercial quantities for sale in the us and other countries  if and when we obtain regulatory approval 
we cannot be sure that our estimates of capital expenditures for the development of our new products will be accurate 
we could have significant cost overruns  which could reduce our ability to commercialize our products 
any delay or inability to commercialize our products under development could adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk while we do not invest for speculative purposes  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our guidelines allow for an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us treasury notes  federal agency obligations  state and municipal bonds  and corporate bonds with maturities of two years or less and ratings of at least aa by moody s or standard poor s 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march   we believe the decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be immaterial 
we believe  however  that we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected by a change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio
