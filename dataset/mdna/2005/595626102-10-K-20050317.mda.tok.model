b beginning in the late s  the company began a process to transform itself from a worldwide operator of both franchised and company operated shops into a focused operator of the north american franchise system 
this transformation included the sale of midas franchised and company operated shop businesses in europe and australia  and a shift in focus to the licensing of midas trademarks and know how outside of north america 
within north america  the transformation included changing consumer perceptions about midas and the products and services offered  improving relationships with franchisees and redeploying assets to improve returns

retail operations consist of franchised and company operated midas shops in north america and licensed midas shops in other countries 
supply chain activities include the manufacture and distribution of exhaust products and value added merchandising services under which the company establishes relationships with vendors who distribute products directly to midas shops 
real estate activities include the development  ownership and leasing of midas shops in north america 
prior to  midas operated a warehouse network that distributed automotive parts and accessories to midas and non midas automotive repair shops 
this network was shut down in and certain activities were outsourced on behalf of midas dealers 
midas has historically operated as an under car specialist focused on the replacement of exhaust  brakes  and shocks and struts 
as recently as  exhaust and brake repair services constituted of midas retail shop revenues in the us market 
as automobile manufacturers began to employ non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems in the mid s  the average life of an original equipment exhaust system began to increase from three years to over years 
as a result  beginning in the mid s  midas core exhaust replacement business began to experience sustained revenue declines 
this trend  combined with the increased technological complexity and durability of newer vehicles  has changed the nature of automotive repairs 
today  the services performed over the lifetime of a vehicle are more likely to be maintenance services and light repair work 
in response to the above described trends  and in order to offset declining sales of exhaust products in the company s retail and wholesale distribution operations  the company began to expand its retail service offerings 
table of contents across the midas system 
in fiscal  the company launched an initiative to expand into categories such as general repair  heat exchange products and climate control services 
this expansion of midas retail service offerings has substantially offset the continuing deterioration in the exhaust replacement market  in which exhaust sales have declined at an average rate of per year at us midas shops since as a result  the average sales of a us midas system shop has been fairly stable over the past five years 
however  the financial and operating impact on the company s wholesale operations was much more severe 
from to  total revenues in the traditional wholesale distribution operation decreased more than  driven by the steep erosion in the market for exhaust product replacement 
the company s wholesale operation expanded its product offerings in fiscal and in order to support the retail system s drive into new services 
however  the parts required in the new services tended to be of higher cost  such that midas dealers preferred just in time sourcing of many of these parts 
consequently  the expansion of products in the wholesale operation did not significantly slow the decline in sales through the traditional wholesale distribution channel 
additionally  in fiscal the company launched parts warehouse  inc pwi  a network of small  quick delivery warehouses to serve the growing just in time parts requirements of midas and non midas professional installers 
while this operation better matched the evolving wholesale distribution needs of midas dealers  its growth from start up in fiscal to stores by fiscal required substantial working capital  and profitability suffered due to start up costs and low sales at newer locations 
by the close of fiscal  both the traditional wholesale parts distribution and the pwi quick delivery parts distribution operations were losing money 
furthermore  the company had over million in inventory committed to wholesale parts distribution  and held substantial accounts receivable related to these operations 
in growing these businesses during fiscal and  midas had incurred significant debt  which had risen to more than million 
during late fiscal and early fiscal  midas management determined that the wholesale operation was no longer a strategic asset and began the process of outsourcing the distribution of parts in north america and disposing of most of its wholesale distribution and pwi assets 
while the erosion in the profitability of the wholesale operation precipitated the need for change  the company s decision to outsource the wholesale parts distribution needs of the midas system became the catalyst for a much more far reaching and dramatic restructuring of the company that is currently underway 
the midas business transformation during fiscal  midas developed and began to implement a plan to dramatically restructure the company s operations and re direct the company s strategic focus towards the midas retail system 
this plan is intended to transform the company by improving profitability  enhancing the competitive position of the midas retail system  strengthening the company s balance sheet and reducing future capital requirements 
this transformation encompasses sweeping changes in the way midas dealers are supplied with genuine midas products and other replacement auto parts  a re definition of the service relationship between midas dealers and their customers  and a shift in the way the company approaches its relationship with midas franchisees 
certain aspects of the transformation were completed in fiscal while others continued into fiscal and beyond 
during  the company outsourced the wholesale distribution of genuine midas products and other replacement parts  closed all but one of the company s regional distribution centers  disposed of its pwi quick delivery distribution locations through sale or closure  closed or re franchised company operated shops  and significantly reduced corporate administrative overhead 
in october  the company announced its intention to sell its ipc exhaust distribution business and exit exhaust manufacturing 
midas believes that exhaust manufacturing no longer represents a strategic fit for the company s evolving retail focused business model 
when completed  the company expects that midas exit from exhaust manufacturing will have the effect of further reducing overall company revenues and expenses compared to current and historical levels  and will increase the company s operating margin 
as a result its decision to exit the exhaust manufacturing and distribution business  the company will eventually close its factory in hartford  wisconsin and its distribution center in chicago  illinois 
the closure of 
table of contents these facilities likely will result in additional business transformation charges for employee severance  facility shut down costs  and the write down of the carrying value of certain fixed assets  inventory and certain other assets to their net realizable value 
the nature  amount and timing of these charges will depend on the finalization of a sale transaction 
both the hartford and chicago facilities are owned by the company and ultimately will be sold as a result of midas exit from the manufacturing business 
the proceeds from the sale of these facilities and other asset liquidation activity are expected to more than offset the cash costs associated with employee severance and facility shut down 
the midas business transformation  and the resulting changes to the way the company does business  will continue to evolve through fiscal and beyond 
the ultimate objective of the midas business transformation was established in and is reflected in midas vision of midas management is working towards achieving increase in midas shop sales on a same store basis 
three core services brakes  exhaust and maintenance 
doubling of midas dealer profits 
one midas the company and midas dealers working together as one in support of the retail system 
with these goals in mind  midas management is committed to the company s mission of becoming the most trusted professional and first choice for customers auto service needs 
the specific components of the midas business transformation and how the company intends to move forward are discussed in greater detail below 
supply chain transformation historically  the company supported the midas franchise network with manufacturing of certain exhaust products and distribution of genuine midas products and other replacement auto parts on a weekly basis to its retail shops in north america 
the company distributed these products through a network of regional wholesale parts distribution centers 
additionally  as dealers began to source more product on a just in time basis  the company supported numerous midas dealers through its network of pwi quick delivery locations 
together  these two wholesale operations provided a significant portion of the typical midas dealer s ongoing parts sourcing needs 
however  the combined wholesale operation generated operating losses  driven by eroding sales of traditional wholesale products  especially exhaust  and start up losses associated with newer pwi locations 
furthermore  as of the end of fiscal  the company still needed to build an additional to pwi locations to adequately cover midas dealers across north america 
in response to the operating losses and significant current and future capital requirements of these wholesale operations  midas determined that continuing to support the traditional midas wholesale distribution operation and the growth of the pwi network was no longer financially viable  and that the parts sourcing needs of midas shops could be better served by outsourcing the distribution of genuine midas parts in the us and canada 
thus  during fiscal  midas closed its traditional midas wholesale parts distribution and pwi quick delivery operations and appointed autozone  inc and uni select inc as the exclusive distributors of genuine midas products in the us and canada  respectively 
the company s agreements with autozone and uni select provide for the weekly distribution of replacement parts to midas retail shops  consistent with the service previously provided by the company s traditional wholesale operation 
the company believes these agreements enable midas dealers to purchase both genuine midas product and other replacement auto parts at favorable pricing  and provide dealers with access to just in time parts delivery through a broad network of quick delivery parts distribution sites across north america 
under its agreements with autozone and uni select  the company receives royalties on the sale of all products sold by autozone and uni select to midas dealers throughout north america 
these royalties are intended to offset the cash expenses associated with the lifetime warranty issued on all genuine midas products 

table of contents in late  the company expanded its relationships with parts providers in the us to include the national automotive parts association napa and carquest corporation 
these additional automotive parts supply relationships were established primarily to expand the geographic scope of just in time parts delivery options available to midas dealers throughout the us similar to the autozone relationship  the company receives royalties on the sale of all products sold by napa and carquest to midas dealers in the us  and these royalties are used to offset costs associated with the midas lifetime warranty program 
midas believes that autozone s weekly distribution of parts to midas dealers  combined with the broad geographic coverage of the autozone  napa and carquest store networks providing just in time parts delivery service  offer midas dealers in the us extensive access to replacement parts at favorable pricing 
finally  in october  the company announced its intention to sell its ipc exhaust distribution business and exit exhaust manufacturing 
midas believes that exhaust manufacturing no longer represents a strategic fit for the company s evolving retail focused business model 
midas believes that exiting exhaust manufacturing will best enable the company to ensure that midas franchisees have access to competitively priced  high quality exhaust products going forward and allow the company to continue providing the long standing midas lifetime warranty on mufflers 
through this transformation of the midas supply chain  the company has eliminated operating losses and working capital requirements associated with its traditional midas wholesale distribution and pwi networks 
additional losses and working capital requirements will be eliminated upon the successful completion of midas exit from exhaust manufacturing 
in the new business model  the company is focused on working cooperatively with franchisees to ensure access to high quality parts at favorable prices  while generating product royalties that require little working capital investment and support the financial health of the midas lifetime warranty program 
retail transformation the midas system of retail service shops has historically operated as an under car specialist focused primarily on the replacement of exhaust  brakes  and shocks and struts 
consequently  much of the work performed by midas shops represented one time repair transactions 
however  improvements in the quality of original equipment parts and the technological complexity of automobiles over the past decade have changed the nature of automotive repair 
the services performed over the lifetime of today s vehicles are more likely to be scheduled maintenance services and light repair work 
the company s initial response to these trends was to promote the expansion of services offered by midas dealers 
this program was known as the new midas and was launched in fiscal while the midas retail system made progress in broadening its services  it has not yet been widely successful in developing ongoing service relationships with its customers 
going forward  midas is focused on becoming less dependent upon one time transactions and more focused on building long term customer relationships 
the company intends to transform itself from a repair business that offers maintenance service  into a maintenance business that performs repairs 
to this end  the company has re defined the core services of the midas system to now encompass exhaust  brakes and maintenance 
in fiscal  midas successfully launched a major retail initiative to significantly expand midas shop sales of tires and related tire services 
the company is also currently rolling out a comprehensive program targeting the fleet vehicle maintenance market segment 
this program is designed to leverage the national scope of the midas system and equip dealers with the necessary tools to build sustainable fleet service revenues 
finally  the company is implementing a series of initiatives designed to enhance the midas system s ability to build revenue from retail maintenance services 
these initiatives include the standardization of key maintenance services across the midas system  increased focus on customers factory scheduled maintenance requirements and the rollout of a national customer relationship marketing crm program in which dealers utilize targeted promotional mailings to increase shop visit frequency among existing customers and more efficiently establish relationships with new customers 
the initial results from this retail transformation have been encouraging 
the company has achieved positive comparable shop sales in the us for seven consecutive quarters and total overall midas system 
table of contents revenues in the us grew in compared to  the first such increase since the company believes that  with its sharpened focus on retail execution within the midas system  it can continue these positive sales trends going forward and begin to grow the overall midas system shop count 
corporate transformation with the outsourcing of the company s wholesale distribution and pwi operations during fiscal  and with the announcement in of the company s intention to exit the exhaust manufacturing and distribution business  midas corporate direction is focused on the midas retail system 
now and in the future  all of the company s operations and activities are assessed based on their contribution to the overall corporate goal of building a successful retail system in north america and the world 
as part of the company s restructuring in  all corporate positions were evaluated 
consistent with the company s strategic focus  there has been a significant reduction in the total number of employees across all operations  from approximately  employees at the close of fiscal to approximately employees at the end of fiscal in addition to the decrease in the total number of employees  the nature of the work performed has changed  as existing roles have been re defined 
for example  whereas before this transformation process began  the company s franchise system district managers were engaged in monitoring compliance with various wholesale initiatives  today their roles are squarely focused on assisting midas franchisees and coordinating the rollout of key retail initiatives that enhance the profitable growth of the midas system 
in addition  the midas franchise development function has been re constituted with additional staff and resources 
since the mid s  this function had not been a focus of the company 
going forward  midas management is focused on re establishing the company s capacity to organically grow the midas franchise system throughout north america and the world 
this corporate transformation continues to evolve based on the needs of the retail system 
midas believes it has taken the necessary steps to eliminate excess administrative expense and focus all management efforts on the new corporate direction 
financial transformation as of the end of fiscal  midas was a highly leveraged company with substantial investments in fixed assets and working capital 
midas wholesale distribution operations  including the traditional midas wholesale operation and the pwi network  were both generating operating losses 
the combined wholesale distribution operation had over million in merchandise inventory  and the company held more than million in accounts receivable generated by wholesale activity 
furthermore  the company maintained its investment in regional distribution centers and pwi locations with ongoing capital expenditures 
facing continuing losses in the wholesale operations  midas determined that continuing to support the traditional midas wholesale distribution operation and pwi network was no longer financially viable  and that the parts sourcing needs of midas system dealers could be better served by outsourcing the distribution of genuine midas products and other replacement parts in the us and canada 
as a result  during fiscal midas closed all but one of its regional distribution centers and disposed of all of its pwi locations through sale or closure 
in a further extension of the company s strategy of redefining its supply chain role  the company announced in late its intention to sell its ipc exhaust distribution business and exit exhaust manufacturing 
during fiscal  the company expects to liquidate the fixed assets  inventory and receivables associated with that operation 
the liquidation of inventory and accounts receivable from its various wholesale operations enabled midas to pay down more than million in debt by the end of fiscal in fiscal  midas was able to further reduce debt by its improving cash flow from operations as well as through the ongoing liquidation of excess fixed assets and working capital that is no longer required under the company s new business model 
as a result  total debt in declined an additional million and the company was able to refinance its debt facilities in march at much more favorable terms 
this substantially reduced cash interest expense and further enhanced free cash flow while providing for greater flexibility in how the company can deploy its free cash flow in the future 

table of contents going forward  total sales will decline as a result of the eventual exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution 
however  midas management believes the exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution will be accretive to earnings and free cash flow while further reducing the company s investment in fixed assets and working capital 
midas management believes the company can achieve  in the long run  operating margins through the successful execution of the company s vision this new business model is capable of generating substantial free cash flow from operations with relatively low working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
the company intends to utilize some of this free cash flow to grow the midas retail system 
however  midas management also believes that a portion of this free cash flow can be used to repurchase shares of the company s stock 
consequently  in november  the company announced that the board of directors had authorized a share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to million in midas stock 
no repurchases were made under this plan in business transformation charges the charges recorded in association with the company s business transformation process in fiscal years  and are summarized in the following tables business transformation charges by strategic initiative fiscal year disposition of parts warehouse  inc rationalization of company operated shops redesign of the wholesale distribution network severance and administrative costs total business transformation charges business transformation charges by activity fiscal year warranty reserve establishment inventory write down goodwill write off and impairment accounts receivable write down fixed asset write off and impairment severance and other separation costs non recoverable lease costs warehouse and other closure costs financing costs pension asset write down other costs total business transformation charges additional information regarding each of the business transformation costs listed in the above summary is presented in note of notes to financial statements 
fiscal reporting periods fiscal was comprised of weeks  fiscal was comprised of weeks  and fiscal was comprised of weeks 

table of contents results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales and revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal to million  reflecting the impact of the company s business transformation activities that were initiated during fiscal within the retail auto service business  royalty revenues and license fees increased from due to an increase in royalties from international licensees  a comparable shop increase in system wide midas retail sales in north america and the positive sales impact of the company s re franchising of company operated shops during fiscal  whose royalties were previously not included in franchising revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in north american shop count and lower franchise fee revenue compared to the prior year  when re franchising of company operated shops increased franchise fee revenue 
sales from company operated shops declined million  or a decrease of from fiscal the entire sales decrease reflects a reduction in the average number of company operated shops in operation during compared to the prior year as comparable shop sales increased in revenues from real estate rentals increased slightly to million 
the increase primarily reflects scheduled rent increases and the re franchising of previously company operated shops during fiscal  which offset a decrease in the number of shops in operation 
replacement part sales and product royalties decreased million to million from million in fiscal the decrease reflects the company s exit from the traditional wholesale and pwi parts distribution businesses during fiscal fiscal revenues are comprised primarily of the sale of exhaust products  sales of tires  oil and batteries that are shipped directly to shops by the manufacturers but billed through midas  and product royalties 
during fiscal  product royalties earned on the sale of parts to midas dealers by autozone and uni select increased more than three fold over the prior year when the transition to the autozone and uni select outsourced distribution arrangements had only just begun 
sales of tires  oil and batteries increased in  consistent with the company s expansion into maintenance services at the retail shop level 
exhaust sales declined in fiscal  consistent with the long term trend 
however  comparison of exhaust sales between and are not meaningful due to the distribution outsourcing 
gross profit margin was in fiscal compared to a gross profit margin of in fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded charges to gross profit of million to establish a reserve for estimated future claims related to its lifetime warranty of exhaust and brake products in the us and canada  and to write down the value of inventory associated with the company s exit from the traditional wholesale parts distribution business 
in fiscal  the company recorded an additional million inventory write down in association with the company s exit from the traditional wholesale parts distribution operation 
excluding these charges to gross profit  the company s gross profit margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to a shift in the mix of the company s revenues towards a greater share of sales derived from higher margin franchising and company operated shop operations 
the favorable shift in sales mix helped to offset significantly lower gross margins generated on the sale of exhaust parts in connection with the company s outsourcing of exhaust distribution to autozone and uni select  compared to the gross margins the company realized in fiscal when selling exhaust and other auto parts directly to midas franchisees 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased million  or  from million in to million 
the large decrease in expenses reflects the closure of pwi and all but one of the company s regional distribution centers during fiscal  as well as lower operating expenses associated with a reduced number of company operated shops compared to fiscal during fiscal  the company incurred approximately million in expenses related to compliance with the various provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
in fiscal  the company recorded charges to selling  general and administrative expense of million related to business transformation activities 
the charges in primarily represent the reconciliation of actual business transformation costs incurred compared to expected business transformation expense recorded in during fiscal  the company recorded charges of million related to business transformation activities 

table of contents the charges primarily reflected costs incurred as a result of the company s decision to exit the traditional wholesale parts distribution business in the us and canada  as well as costs related to pwi closures and the closure and re franchising of certain company operated shops 
these charges are described in greater detail in note of notes to financial statements 
as a result of the above changes  operating income increased million from an operating loss of million in to operating income of million in these changes caused an increase in operating income margin to in fiscal from a negative in excluding the impact of the above described business transformation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal representing charges to gross profit and selling  general and administrative expense  operating income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal interest expense decreased from million in to million in as result of lower interest rates on borrowings and a substantial reduction in the company s average total debt level compared to the prior year 
in addition  the company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in fiscal to reflect a write off of the unamortized debt discount and financing fees related to the company s prior debt agreement 
in fiscal  the company recorded million in charges related to the early extinguishment of a prior debt agreement 
the company s effective tax rate was a negative in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to state tax refunds and the reversal of a reserve for certain european withholding taxes due to the favorable resolution of the matter 
as a result of the above items  net income improved million from a loss of million in fiscal to income of million in fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales and revenues for fiscal decreased million or from fiscal to million 
replacement part sales and product royalties decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal replacement part sales through the company s traditional wholesale distribution channel increased driven primarily by the sale and liquidation of wholesale inventory in connection with the company s agreements to outsource wholesale parts distribution to autozone  inc in the us and uni select inc in canada 
excluding the sale and liquidation of inventory related to the company s decision to outsource wholesale distribution  replacement part sales through the traditional channel would have decreased during fiscal  consistent with long term negative sales trends in the traditional wholesale channel  as well as reflecting the closure of all but one of the company s traditional wholesale warehouses by the end of fiscal replacement part sales through the company s pwi wholesale distribution channel  which served the just in time replacement parts needs of midas dealers and customers outside the midas system  decreased  reflecting the closure of all pwi stores during fiscal within the retail auto service business  franchise royalties and license fees decreased million or from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decline in international royalties and license fees due to a restructuring of the company s licensing agreement with magneti marelli spa comparable shop sales at retail in north america were approximately flat compared to the prior year 
a reduction in the midas system total shop count from the prior fiscal year was offset by favorable canadian currency exchange rates and an increase in franchise fees as a result of the re franchising of company operated shops during fiscal revenues from company operated shops declined million  or a decrease of from fiscal the sales decrease primarily reflects a decline in comparable shop sales of  the closure of under performing shops and the re franchising of shops during fiscal the number of company operated shops in operation at january  declined to  compared to shops at the end of fiscal revenue from real estate rentals in fiscal 
table of contents was down million from fiscal driven by the reduction in the midas system shop count  partially offset by favorable canadian currency exchange rates and rental revenue from re franchised company operated shops 
the company s gross profit margin  including business transformation charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the company s gross profit margin excluding business transformation charges decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decline was primarily due to the company s sale of certain wholesale inventory at cost in connection with the outsourcing of traditional midas wholesale distribution to autozone and uni select  and the liquidation of inventory in the pwi distribution channel 
the increased proportion of total sales related to franchise royalties  and royalties received on the sale of replacement parts by autozone and uni select to midas dealers in the us and canada  helped to somewhat offset the negative margin impact of sales related to the wholesale inventory reduction process 
lower margins in real estate primarily reflect reduced rental income on certain sales based rental agreements  the full year impact of depreciation associated with the sale and leaseback of certain previously owned retail properties in fiscal  as well as reduced rental revenue from midas dealers due to shop closures 
during fiscal  the company entered into supply agreements with autozone  inc in the us and uni select inc 
in canada to provide weekly distribution of genuine midas products and other automotive parts to midas dealers throughout north america 
as a result of these outsourcing arrangements  the company no longer operates the traditional midas wholesale distribution business in the us or canada  and the company has ceased operations in all but one of the company s wholesale distribution centers 
during fiscal  the company recorded an inventory write down of million to reduce its wholesale distribution inventory to its expected net realizable value 
this write down was recorded as a component of cost of sales 
in fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million in cost of sales to reduce the value of pwi inventory to its expected net realizable value  as the company had committed to the liquidation of pwi prior to the close of fiscal the company recorded an additional business transformation charge in cost of sales during fiscal to establish a million accrual for estimated future warranty claims 
this accrual relates to warranties issued to customers in the u 
s and canada for certain exhaust and brake parts that carry a lifetime warranty 
the company had not historically maintained an accrual for estimated future warranty claims related to its lifetime guarantee of exhaust and brake products 
instead  the company had historically recorded expenses related to these product warranties as warranty claims were incurred 
this was due to the fact that the average warranty claim generated gross profit to the company  as the revenues and gross profit to midas from a warranty claim exceeded the cost of reimbursement to the franchisee 
as a result of the outsourcing of the wholesale distribution function to autozone in the us and uni select in canada  midas will no longer generate sufficient gross profit on a warranty claim to offset the average warranty claim reimbursement 
consequently  the company recorded million in charges to reflect its estimated liability associated with then outstanding warranties in the us and canada 
on a going forward basis  midas will accrue for the expected future cost of warranty redemptions at the time of the original installation of the warranted part 
this treatment will not affect cash flow associated with warranty redemptions 
selling  general and distribution expenses for fiscal decreased million  or from to million 
lower operating expenses resulted from fewer pwi stores and company operated shops in operation  the closure of all but one of the company s wholesale distribution centers and a reduction in payroll expense due to administrative headcount reductions made in association with the company s business transformation process 
however  these savings were partially offset by incremental expenses incurred during the sale and closure of pwi stores and company operated shop locations  and higher distribution costs related to the liquidation of inventory 
during fiscal  the company recorded charges of million as part of selling  general and distribution expenses related to the company s business transformation process 
these charges are described in greater detail in note of notes to financial statements 

table of contents as a result of the above  the company s operating loss increased million from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal excluding the impact of the above described business transformation charges of million  operating income in fiscal would have been million compared to million in fiscal after excluding million in business transformation charges 
interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of higher interest rates compared to the prior year  higher average debt levels  and the amortization of fees associated with the company s financing agreement completed on march  in addition  the company recorded a charge of million related to the early extinguishment of a prior debt agreement 
the company s effective tax rate was in both fiscal and fiscal as a result of the above items  the company s net loss increased million from a net loss of million in fiscal to a net loss of million in fiscal liquidity  financial condition and capital resources following is a summary of the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for fiscal and  respectively in millions fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents the company s cash management system permits the company to make daily borrowings and repayments on its line of credit 
this allows midas to minimize interest expense and to maintain a cash balance close to zero 
midas cash and cash equivalents decreased million in fiscal the company s operating activities generated net cash of million during fiscal compared to million of cash generated in fiscal factors that contributed to the year over year decrease of million included a million reduction in business transformation costs  net of cash payments  a million reduction in depreciation and amortization due to asset disposals  a million reduction in the amortization of debt discount and financing fees due to a march refinancing  a million gain on sale of assets and million less cash generated by changes in assets and liabilities 
these decreases to cash flow from operating activities were partially offset by an million increase in net income  a million decrease in the deferred tax benefit  and a million increase in loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the million decrease in cash generated by changes in assets and liabilities was primarily due to a much smaller reduction in inventory in fiscal compared to  when the company was selling inventory as part of its exit from the wholesale distribution business  and a million reduction in accrued expenses compared to an million increase in  primarily reflecting the prepayment of an international royalty in december  which was deferred in and recognized in partially offsetting the reduction in cash generated from inventory liquidation and the cash usage related to settlement of business transformation obligations  the company had an increase in accounts payable in compared to a million reduction in accounts payable in  when the company dramatically reduced inventory purchases as it exited the company s former wholesale parts distribution operation 
investing activities used million in cash during fiscal compared to generating million in cash during fiscal fiscal investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures to maintain facilities and investments in information systems  partially offset by cash generated from the sale of a closed warehouse for million 
fiscal investing activities primarily consisted of million in systems 
table of contents development and other maintenance capital expenditures  offset by million in cash generated as the result of asset sales  including a sale and leaseback of the one of the company s distribution facilities  and the sale of certain pwi and company operated shop locations 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash used of million in fiscal in fiscal  the company paid million to reduce debt and lease obligations and paid million in fees in connection with the company s debt refinancing in march in addition  the company received million in cash from the exercise of outstanding stock options 
in fiscal  the company paid million in financing fees and paid million to reduce debt and lease obligations 
additionally  the company issued million warrants valued at million in connection with its debt restructuring 
on january    of these warrants were automatically cancelled because the company met certain financial objectives contained in the warrant agreements 
as of january   a total of  warrants remained outstanding 
at the beginning of  the company had credit facilities consisting of a million revolving loan facility  a million term loan a  and a million term loan b 
these facilities were secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and were scheduled to expire on october  interest on the revolving loan was payable monthly at the prime rate plus or libor plus 
interest on a portion of the term loan a was fixed at  while interest on the balance of the term loan a was payable monthly at the prime rate plus or libor plus 
the interest rate on the term loan b was fixed at cash interest paid monthly plus paid in kind pik  which was added to principal and due at maturity 
availability under the revolving credit facility was based on a borrowing base  which took into consideration the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels 
the revolving credit facility was senior to both the term loan a and term loan b 
on march   the company entered into a new three year  million credit facility to refinance its existing debt facility 
the new debt facility was initially comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the new facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and expires on march  under the terms of the debt refinancing  the company retired its former million revolving credit facility as well as its term a and term b loans 
the refinancing resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million due to the write off of unamortized debt discount and financing fees 
interest on the million revolving loan was initially payable monthly at libor plus 
interest on the million term loan was initially payable monthly at libor plus 
the interest rates float based on the underlying rate of libor and the company s leverage 
availability under the revolving credit facility is not predicated on a borrowing base 
the new facility requires maintenance of certain financial covenants including maximum allowable leverage and minimum tangible net worth 
on november   the company amended its new debt facility to reduce required principal amortization under the term loan  remove certain restrictive covenants  and reduce interest rates 
as amended  the term loan now requires quarterly principal payments of million  and must be prepaid by an amount equal to i of equity issued  or ii million of the first million of proceeds from the sale of the company s exhaust manufacturing business plus of any proceeds between million and million  or iii of any other material asset proceeds in excess of million other than the sale of inventory in the normal course of business 
a total of million of the term loan is reported as current in the january  balance sheet as a result of this amendment 
the amendment also eliminated the company s restrictions on capital expenditures and treasury stock repurchases  and reduced the interest rate on both the term loan and revolving loan by basis points 
based on the new rates and the company s year end debt levels  interest on the revolving loan is currently payable at libor plus and interest on the term loan is currently payable at libor plus 
in april  the company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to convert million of the million term loan from a floating rate to a fixed rate  by locking in libor at for the three year term of the 
table of contents loan 
the swap amount is reduced quarterly based on scheduled term loan principal amortization payments 
as of january   approximately million of the million term loan balance was subject to this interest rate swap arrangement 
on november   the midas board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to begin in fiscal for up to million 
the company intends to use internally generated funds over the next several years to repurchase shares from time to time in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions  depending upon market and business conditions 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and availability under the current debt agreement will provide sufficient liquidity to finance operations  execute strategic initiatives  and repurchase shares

no payments were made in fiscal additionally  midas is due rental revenue in the amounts shown below under sublease agreements on leased properties and rental agreements on owned properties rental revenue due to midas by period in millions total less than year years years after years rental revenue commitments on leased properties rental revenue commitments on owned properties total rental revenue commitments critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management must make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied  the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates  and the consistent application of 
table of contents those accounting principles 
due to the type of industry in which the company operates and the nature of its business  and the company s existing business transformation process  the following accounting policies are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of warranty liabilities customers are provided a written warranty from midas on genuine midas products purchased from midas shops in north america 
the warranty will be honored at any midas shop in north america and is valid for the lifetime of the vehicle  but is voided if the vehicle is sold 
the company maintains a warranty accrual to cover the estimated future liability associated with outstanding warranties 
the company determines the estimated value of outstanding warranty claims based on an estimate of the percentage of all warranted products sold and registered in prior periods at retail that are likely to be redeemed  and an estimate of the cost of redemption of each future warranty claim on a current cost basis 
these estimates are computed using actual historical registration and redemption data as well as actual cost information on current redemptions 
an increase of one percentage point in the estimated percentage of warranted products likely to be redeemed in the us would have the effect of increasing midas january  outstanding us warranty liability by million  while a decrease of one percentage point in the estimated us redemption rate would decrease midas outstanding us warranty liability by million 
a change in the estimated current cost of warranty redemptions of one dollar would have the effect of changing midas outstanding us warranty liability by million 
prior to fiscal  the company had not maintained an accrual for estimated future warranty claims related to its lifetime guarantee of exhaust and brake products 
instead  the company recorded expenses related to these product warranties as warranty claims were incurred 
this was due to the fact that the average warranty claim generated gross profit to the company  as the revenues and gross profit to midas from a warranty claim exceeded the cost of reimbursement to the franchisee 
as a result of the fiscal outsourcing of the midas distribution function to autozone  inc in the us  and uni select inc in canada  midas no longer generates sufficient gross profit on a warranty claim to offset the average warranty claim reimbursement 
consequently  the company recorded charges during fiscal to reflect its estimated liability associated with outstanding warranties in the us and canada 
since the warranty accrual was established in fiscal  midas has accrued for the expected future cost of warranty redemptions at the time of the original installation of the warranted part based on the method described above 
this treatment did not affect cash flow associated with warranty redemptions in either the u 
s or canada 
inventory valuation as a manufacturer and distributor of certain automotive aftermarket parts  inventory has historically represented a substantial portion of the total assets of the company 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
inventory cost is determined using the weighted average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
additionally  the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its inventory to assess the proper valuation 
this includes having adequate allowances to cover losses in the normal course of operations  provide for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this evaluation the company considers historical data such as actual loss experience  past and projected usage  and actual margins generated from sales of its products 
during fiscal and  the company sold and liquidated inventory in connection with the implementation of its ongoing business transformation 
the company recorded charges in fiscal  and fiscal to write down certain inventories to their net realizable value as a result of the disposition of pwi and the outsourcing of the company s wholesale parts distribution operation 
in assessing the net realizable value of the inventory that was to be sold and liquidated  the company considered original cost  past and projected usage  independent third party appraisals and offers made by potential buyers 

table of contents valuation of receivables the company records receivables due from its franchisees and other customers at the time the sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
these receivables consist of amounts due from the sale of products  royalties due from franchisees and suppliers  rents and other amounts 
the future collectibility of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it feels may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables and by monitoring the financial strength of its franchisees and other customers 
where the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg where it is in financial distress or has filed for bankruptcy  the company specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of receivables is performed on a quarterly basis 
in connection with the disposal of the pwi business and the exit of the midas wholesale distribution business  in valuing outstanding receivable balances the company also considered the reduced collection efforts that result from the closings as well as the increased likelihood that customers will not pay amounts due 
pensions the company has non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees 
the company s funding policy for the us plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a minimum liability is required to be established on the balance sheet representing the amount of unfunded accrued pension cost 
this represents the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
when it is necessary to establish an additional minimum pension liability  an amount is recorded as an intangible asset limited to unrecognized prior service cost 
any amount in excess of unrecognized prior service cost is recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity through cumulative other comprehensive income  net of tax  in the balance sheet 
as of january   the million prepaid pension cost  net of valuation reserves of approximately million pertaining to the partial wind up of the canadian salaried pension plan and the full wind up of the canadian hourly pension plan  was recorded in the company s balance sheet as a million accrued pension liability  an intangible pension asset of million and an accumulated reduction to shareholders equity of million million  net of taxes 
to account for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must make three main determinations at the end of each fiscal year first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments and periodic published rate ranges 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the discount rates used by year 
second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for rates of increase in compensation levels used in the calculation of the accumulated and projected benefit obligations for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
in determining this rate the company looks at its historical and expected rates of annual salary increases 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the rates of increase in compensation levels used by year 
third  the company must determine the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption that is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is deferred under sfas 
table of contents no 
and is recognized to net periodic pension cost over a five year period 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the expected long term rates used by year 
the company assumed a long term rate of return on pension assets of in both fiscal and  and experienced gains on plan assets of million in fiscal and million in fiscal carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 the company conducts tests for impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that an asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
midas evaluates the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used in the business by reviewing undiscounted cash flows by asset group 
such evaluations are performed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining lives of the related assets does not exceed the carrying values of the assets  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and the carrying values 
additionally  in the case of fixed assets related to locations that will be closed or sold  the company writes down fixed assets to their estimated recovery value 
the company s evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and other long lived assets as of the end of fiscal indicated that an impairment existed with respect to long lived assets used in company operated shops 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge to operating expense of million and reduced long lived assets in fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to goodwill and million to long lived assets related to the company operated shops 
deferred income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at january  in the event that management determines the company would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of january   the company had recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain state income tax net operating loss carryovers because the company has determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
self insurance reserves historically  the company has been largely self insured with respect to workers compensation  general liability  and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce its risk and better manage its overall loss exposure  the company purchases stop loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts 
the company maintains an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates take into consideration the historical average monthly claim volume  the average cost for settled claims  current trends in claim costs  changes in the company s business and workforce  and general economic factors 
these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review 
as of january   the company is no longer self insured with respect to employee medical claims and has converted to a fully insured medical program
