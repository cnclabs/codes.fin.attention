item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis provides information which the company s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere herein 
the company is subject to external factors that could significantly impact its business  including potential reductions in reimbursement rates by medicare  medicaid and other third party payers for the company s services  retroactive adjustments due to prior year audits  reviews and investigations  government fraud and abuse initiatives and other such factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results 
as a medicaid provider in connecticut  the company is subject to routine  unscheduled audits 
these audits may result in the application of a statistically derived adjustment factor to the company s revenues  which may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
although the audits to date have not resulted in any material adjustments  such audits were conducted at a time when the company had significantly lower medicaid revenues 
there can be no assurance that future medicaid audits will not have a material adverse impact on the company 
the impact of the balanced budget act the balanced budget act was signed into law in august the act made significant changes in the reimbursement system for medicare home health care services 
the primary change affecting the company was a restructuring of the reimbursement system related to medicare certified home health care agencies 
prior to the act  medicare reimbursed providers on a reasonable cost basis subject to program imposed cost per visit limitations 
under the act  changes in medicare home care reimbursement were scheduled in two phases 
a temporary or interim payment system ips took effect for cost reports beginning on or after october  under ips  home health care providers were reimbursed the lowest of i their actual costs  ii cost limits based on of median costs of freestanding home health agencies  or iii an agency specific per patient cost limit  based on costs adjusted for inflation 
under ips  most medicare providers were actually reimbursed under an agency specific per patient cost limit 
effective october   under the prospective payment system  medicare now reimburses providers a predetermined base payment 
the payment is adjusted for the health condition and care needs of the beneficiary and is also adjusted for geographic differences in wages across the country 
medicare provides home health agencies with payments for day episodes of care 
the final phase of the act implemented a cut in medicare reimbursement rates effective october  in two of the last three fiscal years  less than five percent of the company s net patient revenue was derived directly from medicare  and accordingly the change to the prospective payment system has not  to date  had a material adverse impact on the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the medicare prospective payment system will not adversely impact the company s reimbursement rates in the future or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s operations in new york are dependent upon referrals  primarily from medicare certified home health care agencies  whose reimbursement has been adversely affected by the prospective payment system 
under the prospective payment system  there can be no assurance that the company s future referrals will not result in reduced reimbursement rates or reduced volume of business 
recent acquisitions the following acquisitions were made through one of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries 
with the exception of medical resources  inc medical resources described below  these acquisitions complemented an existing business of the company in the geographical area in which the entity whose assets were acquired provided services

at the time of its acquisition  the revenues of each acquired business constituted less than ten percent of the consolidated revenues of the company

critical accounting policies the company believes that the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are those policies relating to recognizing net patient revenue  determining the value of accounts receivable  and assessing the value of goodwill and other long lived assets 
net patient revenue 
the company recognizes net patient revenue generally on the date services are provided to patients 
net patient revenue is recorded at amounts the company expects to receive under reimbursement arrangements with third party payers  including private insurers  private payers  subcontractors  medicaid and medicare 
because the company s business depends upon third party payers whose reimbursement rates and payment policies are complex and subject to possible change from time to time  the company must make estimates with respect to certain amounts it records as the net realizable value of net patient revenue and accounts receivable 
because of the potential for changes in these third party reimbursement rates and payment policies  and as a result of the complexity of certain of these policies  the estimated amounts originally recorded as net patient revenue and accounts receivable may be subject to revision as additional information becomes known 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for possible losses that provides a reserve with respect to those accounts for which net patient revenue was recognized but with respect to which management subsequently determines that payment is not expected to be received 
the company analyzes the balances of accounts receivable to ensure that the recorded amounts properly reflect the amounts expected to be collected 
this analysis involves the application of varying percentages to each accounts receivable category based on the age and the collectibility of the receivable 
the result of this aging analysis provides the initial estimate of the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable 
the amount ultimately recorded as the reserve is determined after management also analyzes the collectibility of specific large or problematic accounts on an individual basis  as well as the overall business climate and other factors 
the company s estimate of the percentage of uncollectible accounts may change from time to time and any such change could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
goodwill arising from the acquisitions of businesses is recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets provides that goodwill is to be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
consistent with this standard  the company reviews goodwill  as well as other intangible assets and long term assets  for impairment annually or more frequently as warranted  and if circumstances indicate that the recorded value of any such other asset is impaired  such asset is written down to its proper value 
the company currently does not believe any impairment of its goodwill or any such other asset existed at july  nevertheless  future conditions or events could adversely affect the recorded value of goodwill or such other assets 
if any item of goodwill or such other asset is determined to be impaired  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the amount by which the recorded value exceeds the estimated fair market value
