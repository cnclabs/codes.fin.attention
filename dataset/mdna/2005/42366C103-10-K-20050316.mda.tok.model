item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is related to our financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto beginning on f of this form k 
statement of forward looking information certain statements in the section are forward looking statements 
you should read the information before part i above  special note regarding forward looking statements for more information about our presentation of information 
background we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred  as expected  substantial operating losses due to our conducting clinical testing 
in the course of almost three decades  we have established a strong foundation of laboratory  pre clinical and clinical data with respect to the development of nucleic acids to enhance the natural antiviral defense system of the human body and the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of chronic diseases 
our strategy is to obtain the required regulatory approvals which will allow the progressive introduction of ampligen r our proprietary drug for treating myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome me cfs  hiv  hepatitis c hcv and hepatitis b hbv in the us  canada  europe and japan 
we recently completed a phase iii clinical trial in the us for use of ampligen in treatment of me cfs and are in the process of assembling and analyzing the obtained data preparatory to completing and filing a new drug application nda with the us food and drug administration fda 
we are also testing ampligen in phase iib clinical trials in the us for the treatment of newly emerging multi drug resistant hiv  and for the induction of cell mediated immunity in hiv patients that are under control using potentially toxic drug cocktails 
our proprietary drug technology utilizes specifically configured ribonucleic acid rna and is protected by more than patents worldwide  with over additional patent applications pending to provide further proprietary protection in various international markets 
certain patents apply to the use of ampligen r alone and certain patents apply to the use of ampligen r in combination with certain other drugs 
some compositions of matter patents pertain to other new rna compounds  which have a similar mechanism of action 
in march we obtained from interferon sciences  inc isi all of its raw materials  work in progress and finished product alferon n injection r  together with a limited license to sell alferon n injection r  a natural alpha interferon that has been approved for commercial sale for the intralesional treatment of refractory or recurring external condylomata acuminata genital warts in patients years of age or older in the united states 
in march  we acquired from isi the balance of isi s rights to its product as well as isi s production facility 
we are marketing the alferon n injection r in the united states through sales facilitated via third party agreements 
additionally  we intend to implement studies testing the efficacy of alferon n injection r in multiple sclerosis and other chronic viral diseases 
in this regard  the fda recently authorized a phase ii clinical study designed to investigate the activity and safety of alferon ldo r in early stage hiv positive patients 
we were incorporated in maryland in under the name hem research  inc  and originally served as a supplier of research support products 
our business was redirected in the early s to the development of nucleic acid pharmaceutical technology and the commercialization of rna drugs 
we were reincorporated in delaware and changed our name to hem pharmaceutical corp 
in and to hemispherx biopharma  inc  in june we have three domestic subsidiaries biopro corp  bioaegean corp  and core biotech corp  all of which are incorporated in delaware 
our foreign subsidiaries include hemispherx biopharma europe nv sa established in belgium in and hemispherx biopharma europe sa incorporated in luxembourg in result of operations years ended december  vs 
during the year ended december   we materially improved our cash position  completed the acquisition of our production facility in new brunswick  new jersey  as well as  acquired all of isi s rights to market alferon n  completed drug dosing in our phase iii amp me cfs clinical trial and continued our efforts to develop ampligen alferon n 
our cash position improved as a result of placing january and july convertible debentures with an aggregate maturity value of  gross proceeds of  and the august private placement with select institutional investors of approximately  shares of our common stock and warrants producing  in gross proceeds 
completion of the drug dosing in the amp me cfs clinical trial in august allows us to start the next step towards final data collection and analysis 
progress was made on all fronts including a increase in alferon n sales 
this increase in sales of alferon was due  among other things  to the fact that we were selling for an entire year in compared to nine months in however  we were disappointed in these results as we planned to achieve much higher sales 
adjustments to our marketing strategy were made in late and we expect better results in net loss non cash charges materially affected our net losses for the years ended december  and our losses of  for the year ended december   include non cash financing charges of  and non cash charges of  for stock compensation expenses 
the losses for the same period in of  included non cash financing charges of  this  increase in net operating losses reflects an increase of  in non cash accounting charges   in research and development expenses and  in production cost of goods sold 
the increase in our research and development costs were the result of costs incurred in the development of a more efficient bottling manufacturing process for alferon n injection  vials abstracted from the third lot of alferon n injection inventory for research and development purposes  and costs associated with using alferon n injection in a clinical trial to treat patients infected with the west nile virus 
our production cost cost of goods sold increased due to higher alferon n injection sales  costs related to preparing our new brunswick  nj facility for the installation of the lab now located in rockville  md  and expanding production at our new brunswick facility to include ampligen r raw material 
the  for stock compensation expense primarily consisted of  resulting from warrants issued to dr 
carter in that vested in the first quarter these warrants vested upon the second isi asset closing which occurred on march  see item executive compensation for details related to how dr 
carter has been compensated with respect to this matter 
revenues revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to revenues of  for the same period in revenues for the year ended december  from sales of alferon n totaled  versus  for the period of march   the date we acquired the rights to the alferon n business from isi  through december  sales of alferon n are anticipated to increase as we have more product available and intend to expand our marketing sales programs on an international basis 
revenues from our me cfs cost recovery treatment programs principally underway in the us  canada and europe were  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  these clinical programs allow us to provide ampligen r therapy at our cost to severely debilitated me cfs patients 
under this program the patients pay for the cost of ampligen r doses infused 
these costs total approximately  for a week treatment program 
since acquiring the right to manufacture and market alferon n on march   we have focused on converting the work in progress inventory into finished goods 
this work in progress inventory included three production lots totaling the equivalent of approximately  vials doses at various stages of the manufacturing process 
approximately  vials have been produced 
some  of the remaining vials within this lot were held back to be utilized in the development of a more compatible vial size for manufacturing of alferon n injection 
we plan on initiating the process of converting the third lot of approximately  vials from work in progress to finished goods inventory in approximately  vials were abstracted from the third lot for research and development purposes as well during the th quarter our production and quality control personnel in our new brunswick  nj facility are involved in the extensive process of manufacturing and validation required by the fda 
our sales and marketing agreement with engitech  llc 
to distribute alferon n on a nationwide basis did not produce the desired result 
sales have not increased as planned and we are expanding our in house sales and marketing efforts 
we are considering the use of other sales organizations in order to meet our alferon n sales goals 
we executed a memorandum of understanding mou in january with fujisawa deutschland gmbh  fuji a major pharmaceutical corporation  granting them an exclusive option for a limited number of months to enter a sales and distribution agreement with exclusive rights to market ampligen r for me cfs in germany  austria and switzerland 
the mou required us to file the full report on the results of our amp clinical trial with fuji by may  if the full report was not provided to fuji by may  and fuji did not wish to exercise its option  we would have been required to refund one half of the  euro fee 
we submitted our initial report to fuji on may  and responded to subsequent inquiries for additional information 
the option period ends weeks after the later of fuji s review of the full report on the results of our amp clinical trial and fuji s meeting with three of the trial s principal investigators 
we received an initial fee of  euros approximately  us 
if we did not provide them with the full report by december  and fuji did not wish to exercise its option  we would be required to refund the entire fee 
on november   we and fuji terminated the mou by mutual agreement 
we did not agree on the process to be utilized in certain european territories for obtaining commercial approval for the sale of ampligen r in the treatment of patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome cfs 
instead of a centralized procedure  and in order to obtain an earlier commercial approval of ampligen r in europe  we have determined to follow a decentralized filing procedure which was not anticipated in the mou 
we believe that it now is in the best interest of our stockholders to potentially accelerate entry into selected european markets whereas the original mou specified a centralized registration procedure 
pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties we refunded  euros to fuji 
we have recorded the remaining  euros as an accrued liability as of december  we are currently holding the  euros pending further developments in accordance with the mutually agreed upon termination with fuji 
on march   we closed on the acquisition of all of the worldwide rights of alferon n as well as the fda approved biological production facility in new brunswick  new jersey 
we are looking to expand our marketing sales programs on an international basis 
production costs cost of goods sold production costs for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
these costs reflect approximately  for the cost of sales of alferon n injection r for the year ended december  in addition  costs of sales for alferon n injection r for the period march  acquisition date of inventory from isi through december  amounted to  the remaining production costs in represent expenditures associated with preparing the new brunswick facility for the installation of the lab now located in rockville  md and for further production of alferon n injection r and ampligen r raw materials 
in august  we released most of the second lot of product approximately  vials to abbott laboratories for bottling and realized approximately  vials of alferon n 
some  of the remaining vials within this lot were held back to be utilized in the development of a more compatible vial size for manufacturing of alferon n injection 
we plan on initiating the process of converting the third lot of approximately  vials from work in progress to finished goods inventory in approximately  vials were abstracted from the third lot for research and development purposes as well during the current quarter 
our production and quality control personnel in our new brunswick  nj facility are involved in the extensive process of manufacturing and validation required by the fda 
research and development costs overall research and development direct costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  during the same period a year earlier 
these costs primarily reflect the direct costs associated with our effort to develop our lead product  ampligen r  as a therapy in treating chronic diseases and cancers as well as on going clinical trials involving patients with hiv 
the primary reasons for the increase in research and development costs of  for the year ended december  versus the same period a year ago were primarily due to costs incurred in the development of a more efficient bottling manufacturing process for alferon n injection  vials abstracted from the third lot of alferon n injection inventory for research and development purposes  and costs associated with using alferon n injection in a clinical trial to treat patients infected with the west nile virus 
we recently completed the double blind segment of our amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial for use of ampligen r in the treatment of me cfs 
clinical data on the primary endpoint exercise treadmill duration was presented at the th international conference on anti viral research in tucson  az on may  the data showed that patients receiving ampligen for weeks improved exercise treadmill performance by a medically and statistically significant amount compared to the placebo group 
new data was presented at the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy on increases in exercise capacity with ampligen and placebo which were correlated with an improved ability to utilize oxygen  so called  maximum oxygen consumption or vomax 
vomax has been previously shown by others to be decreased with individuals with cfs 
an abnormal exercise stress test  including a low vomax  could help qualify cfs patients for disability under social security administration rules 
additional data on subset analyses showed that both stratification cohorts those with baseline exercise treadmill duration greater than or less than nine minutes improved exercise capacity by over  an amount considered medically significant in other chronic diseases 
ampligen is also currently in two phase iib studies for the treatment of hiv to overcome multi drug resistance  virus mutation and toxicity associated with current haart therapies 
one study  the amp  is a salvage therapy  conducted in the us and evaluating the potential synergistic efficacy of ampligen in multi drug resistant hiv patients for immune enhancement 
the second study  the amp  is a clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of ampligen under strategic treatment intervention and is also conducted in the us enrollment in the amp study is presently on hold as we focus our efforts on ramping up the amp study 
me cfs over patients have participated in our me cfs phase iii clinical trial 
in august  the remaining patients completed drug dosing in the open label segment stage ii of this phase iii protocol 
we completed the randomized placebo controlled phase stage i of this study in february and have started final data collection for the data analysis 
this process includes validation and quality assurance and should be completed by early as with any experimental drug being tested for use in treating human diseases  the fda must approve the testing and clinical protocols employed and must render their decision based on the safety and efficacy of the drug being tested 
historically this is a long and costly process 
our me cfs amp clinical study is a phase iii study  which based on favorable results  will serve as the basis for us to file a new drug application with the fda 
the fda review process could take months and result in one of the following events  approval to market ampligen r for use in treating me cfs patients  required more research  development  and clinical work  approval to market as well as conduct more testing  or reject our application 
given these variables  we are unable to project when material net cash inflows are expected to commence from the sale of ampligen r 
hiv we are currently focused on recruiting additional clinical investigators and hiv patients to participate in the amp hiv clinical trial 
our efforts to do this have been somewhat hampered as most of our clinical resources have been directed to completing the amp me cfs clinical trial 
now that the amp patients have completed the randomized segment of the clinical trial  we are devoting more resources toward the amp hiv clinical trial 
our amp hiv clinical trial has been put on hold at this time 
the amp hiv study is a treatment using a strategic treatment interruption sti 
the patients antiviral haart regimens are interrupted and ampligen r is substituted as mono immunotherapy 
ampligen r is an experimental immunotherapeutic designed to display both antiviral and immune enhancing characteristics 
prolonged use of highly active antiretroviral therapy haart has been associated with long term  potentially fatal  toxicities 
the clinical study amp is designed to address these issues by evaluating the administration of our lead experimental agent  ampligen r  a double stranded rna drug acting potentially both as an immunomodulator and antiviral 
patients  who have completed at least nine months of ampligen r therapy  were able to stay off haart for a total sti duration with a mean time of weeks whereas the control group  which was also taken off haart  but not given ampligen r  had earlier hiv rebound with a mean duration of weeks 
thus  on average  ampligen r therapy spared the patients excessive exposure to haart  with its inherent toxicities  for more than weeks 
as more patients are enrolled  the related clinical costs will continue to increase with some offset to our overall expenses due to the diminishing cost of the me cfs clinical trial 
it is difficult to estimate the duration or projected costs of these two clinical trials due to the many variables involved  ie patient drop out rate  recruitment of clinical investigators  etc 
the length of the study and costs related to our clinical trials cannot be determined at this time as such will be materially influenced by a the number of clinical investigators needed to recruit and treat the required number of patients  b the rate of accrual of patients and c the retention of patients in the studies and their adherence to the study protocol requirements 
under optimal conditions  the cost of completing the studies could be approximately to million 
the rate of enrollment depends on patient availability and on other products being in clinical trials for the treatment of hiv  as there is competition for the same patient population 
at present  more than fda approved drugs for hiv treatment may compete for available patients 
the length  and subsequently the expense of these studies  will also be determined by an analysis of the interim data  which will determine when completion of the ongoing phase iib is appropriate and whether a phase iii trial be conducted or not 
in case a phase iii study is required  the fda might require a patient population exceeding the current one which will influence the cost and time of the trial 
accordingly  the number of unknowns is sufficiently great to be unable to predict when  or whether  we may obtain revenues from our hiv treatment indications 
in september  we commenced a clinical trial using alferon n injection to treat patients infected with the west nile virus 
the infectious disease section of new york queens hospital and the weill medical college of cornell university will be conducting this double blinded  placebo controlled trial 
during  over  human cases of west nile virus have been reported in states 
manufacturing in order to obtain ampligen r raw materials of higher quality gmp certified and on a more regular production basis  we have implemented consolidation and transfer of relevant manufacturing operations into our new brunswick  new jersey facility 
this consolidation and transfer of manufacturing operations has been implemented as a recent inspection of the ribotech facility in south africa  our previous supplier of ampligen r raw materials  indicated that it did not  at present  meet the necessary gmp standards for a fully certified commercial process 
the transfer of ampligen r raw materials manufacture to our own facilities  while having obvious advantages with respect to regulatory compliance other parts of the  sq 
ft 
wholly owned facility are already in compliance for alferon n manufacture  may delay certain steps in the commercialization process  specifically a targeted nda filing 
to facilitate the process  we are in the process of hiring a senior regulatory officer with specific expertise in global quality assurance for multinational pharmaceutical operations 
in connection with settling various manufacturing infractions previously noted by the fda  schering plough schering entered into a consent decree with the fda whereby  among other things  it agreed to discontinue various contract third party manufacturing activities at various facilities including its san juan  puerto rico  plant 
ampligen r which was not involved in any of the cited infractions was produced at this puerto rico plant from year operating under instructions from the consent decree  schering has recently advised us that it would no longer manufacture ampligen r in this facility at the end of the applicable term which is th quarter and would assist us in an orderly transfer of said activities to other non schering facilities 
accordingly  we have entered into a confidentiality agreement with mayne pharma pty  ltd mayne to lead to reinitiation and expansion of its ampligen r manufacturing program 
we are currently in discussions with mayne to provide us with proposals on manufacturing ampligen r at their facility 
mayne formerly known as faulding pharma has already successfully manufactured ampligen r several times for ongoing clinical trials  and maintains a fully gmp compliant facility 
simultaneously  we expect to qualify at least one other gmp facility to maintain a minimum of two independent production sites 
if we are unable to engage mayne and or additional manufacturers in a timely manner  our plans to file an nda for ampligen r and  eventually  to market and sell ampligen r will be delayed 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in g a expenses of  during this period is primarily due to non cash charges of  for stock compensation expenses in these stock compensation charges consisted of  resulting from warrants issued to dr 
carter in that vested in and directors fees paid in of  the warrants noted above vested upon the second isi asset closing which occurred on march  please see item executive compensation 
contained herein for more details on how dr 
carter was compensated 
in addition  investment banking fees relating to assistance in financing matters increased in as compared to a period early by approximately  these increases were offset by a decrease in service fees in of approximately  as compared to a year earlier 
these services fees related to the acquisition of isi 
impairment loss during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash charge of  with respect to our investment in chronix 
this impairment reduces our carrying value to reflect a permanent decline in chronix s market value based on its then proposed investment offerings 
other income expense interest and other income for the year ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities 
interest expense and financing costs interest expense and financing costs were  for the year ended december  versus  for the same period a year ago 
non cash financing costs consist of the amortization of debenture closing costs  the amortization of original issue discounts and the amortization of costs associated with beneficial conversion features of our debentures and the fair value of the warrants relating to the debentures 
these charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption financing costs 
in connection with the redemption obligation recorded in conjunction with the january debentures  we recorded additional financing costs of approximately  in the first quarter in the second quarter  we recorded a reduction in financing costs of approximately  please see note in the consolidated financial statements contained herein for more details on these transactions 
years ended december  vs 
during the year ended december   we acquired certain assets and patent rights to alferon n injection r  privately placed the march  the july  and october  convertible debentures with an aggregate maturity value of  gross proceeds of  continued our efforts to develop ampligen r for the treatment of patients afflicted with me cfs and hiv  activated the isi new brunswick production facility to process doses of alferon n and produced some  doses of alferon n for sale in net loss our net loss was approximately  for the year ended december  versus a net loss of  in per share loss in was cents versus a per share loss of in this year to year increase in losses of  is primarily due to non cash financing costs of  relating to our march  july  and october convertible debentures 
these non cash charges account for of our net losses for the year ended december  in addition  our losses during this period include  in operating expenses relating to our new alferon division 
solely for comparison purposes  excluding our losses for these two factors  our losses were  in compared to  in or a reduction totaling  this was primarily due to a decrease in research and development direct costs of  in due to reduced costs associated with the development of ampligen r to treat me cfs patients 
during  our amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial was in full force and effect therefore increasing our manufacturing and clinical support expenses during that period see research and development costs below 
this was offset by the recovery of certain legal expenses in of approximately  related to the asensio lawsuit and trial from our insurance carrier 
this recovery produced a one time reduction in g a expenses for see general and administrative expenses below 
revenues our revenues were  in compared to revenues of  in our revenues included a licensing fee payment of approximately  which was not repeated in revenues from our me cfs cost recovery treatment programs principally underway in the us  canada and europe were  in versus  in these clinical programs allow us to provide ampligen r therapy at our cost to severely debilitated me cfs patients 
under this program the patients pay for the cost of ampligen r doses infused 
these costs total approximately  for a weeks treatment program 
in addition  since the march   acquisition of inventory from isi  revenues from sales of alferon n totaled  sales of alferon n are anticipated to increase as we are producing more product and our marketing sales programs are underway 
revenues from the cost recovery treatment programs in were  or higher than revenues 
we expected revenues in the us to decline due to our efforts to complete the amp me cfs phase iii trials and the focus of our clinical resources on the start up of the amp and amp hiv clinical trials 
the clinical data collected from treating patients under the cost recovery treatment programs will augment and supplement the clinical data collected in the us amp phase iii me cfs trial 
in  we received a licensing fee of  euros  from laboratorios del dr 
esteve sa esteve pursuant to a sales and distribution agreement in which esteve was granted the exclusive right to market ampligen r in spain  portugal and andorra for the treatment of me cfs in turn we provided to esteve technical scientific and commercial information 
the agreement terms require no additional performance by us 
since acquiring the right to manufacture and market alferon n in march  we have focused on converting the work in progress inventory into finished goods 
this work in progress inventory included three production lots totaling the equivalent of approximately  vials doses at various stages of the manufacturing process 
in august  we released the first lot of product to abbott laboratories for bottling and realized some  vials of alferon n 
preliminary work has started on completing the second lot of approximately  vials 
our production and quality control personnel in the new brunswick facility are involved in the extensive process of manufacturing and validation required by the fda 
plans are underway for completing the third lot of some  vials now in very early stages of production 
our marketing and sales plan for alferon n consists of engaging sales force contract organizations and supplementing their sales efforts with marketing support 
this marketing support would consist of building awareness of alferon n with physicians as a successful and effective treatment of refractory on recurring external genital warts in patients of age or older and to assist primary prescribers in expanding their practice 
on august   we entered into a sales and marketing agreement with engitech  llc 
to distribute alferon n on a nationwide basis 
the agreement stipulated that engitech will deploy a sales force of sales representatives within one year in the us domestic market and further expand the sales team up to sales representative in the second year and after that as many as it takes to continually drive market share 
engitech  inc is to develop and implement marketing plans including extensive scientific and educational programs for use in marketing alferon n 
production costs production costs were  for the year ended december  these costs reflect approximately  for the cost of sales of alferon n injection r during the period of april  through december  in addition  we recorded  of production costs at the new brunswick facility 
we ramped up the facility in april and started production on three lots of alferon n injection r work in process inventory of which one lot was completed and is ready to be sold 
research and development costs our overall research and development direct costs in were  compared to research and development direct costs in of  these costs primarily reflect the direct costs associated with our effort to develop our lead product  ampligen r  as a therapy in treating chronic diseases and cancers 
at this time  this effort consists of on going clinical trials involving patients with hiv 
our research and development direct costs are  lower in due to reduced costs associated with the development of ampligen r to treat me cfs patients 
during  our amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial was in full force and effect  therefore  increasing our manufacturing and clinical support expenses during that period 
our strategy is to develop our lead compound  the experimental immunotherapeutic ampligen r  to treat chronic diseases for which there is currently no adequate treatment available 
we seek the required regulatory approval  which will allow the commercial introduction of ampligen for me cfs and hiv aids in the us  canada  europe and japan 
we recently completed the double blind segment of our amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial for use of ampligen r in the treatment of me cfs 
ampligen is also currently in two phase iib studies for the treatment of hiv to overcome multi drug resistance  virus mutation and toxicity associated with current haart therapies 
one study  the amp  is a salvage therapy  conducted in the us and evaluating the potential synergistic efficacy of ampligen in multi drug resistant hiv patients for immune enhancement 
the second study  the amp  is a clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of ampligen under strategic treatment intervention and is also conducted in the us the amp study is presently on hold as we devote our efforts on the amp study 
amp over patients have participated in our me cfs phase iii clinical trial 
approximately patients are in the open label phase of the clinical process 
we have completed the randomized placebo controlled phase of this study and expect to complete data collection and start the data analysis process with the expectation of filing an nda new drug application with the fda by the end of as with any experimental drug being tested for use in treating human diseases  the fda must approve the testing and clinical protocols employed and must render their decision based on the safety and efficacy of the drug being tested 
historically this is a long and costly process 
our me cfs amp clinical study is a phase iii study  which based on favorable results  will serve as the basis for us to file a new drug application with the fda 
the fda review process could take months and result in one of the following events  approval to market ampligen r for use in treating me cfs patients  required more research  development  and clinical work  approval to market as well as conduct more testing  or reject our application 
given these variables  we are unable to project when material net cash inflows are expected to commence from the sale of ampligen r 
amp and amp we are currently focused on recruiting additional clinical investigators and hiv patients to participate in the amp hiv clinical trial 
our efforts to do this have been somewhat hampered in late as most of our clinical resources have been directed to completing the amp me cfs clinical trial 
now that the amp patients have completed the randomized segment of the clinical trial  we expect to devote more resources toward the amp hiv clinical trial 
our amp hiv clinical trial has been put on hold at this time 
in july  dr 
blick  a principal investigator in our hiv studies  presented updated results on our amp hiv study at the nd ias conference on hiv pathogenesis and treatment in paris france 
in this study using strategic treatment interruption sti  patients antiviral haart regimens are interrupted and ampligen r is substituted as mono immunotherapy 
ampligen r is an experimental immunotherapeutic designed to display both antiviral an immune enhancing characteristics 
prolonged use of highly active antiretroviral therapy haart has been associated with long term  potentially fatal  toxicities 
the clinical study amp is designed to address these issues by evaluating the administration of our lead experimental agent  ampligen r  a double stranded rna drug acting potentially both as an immunomodulator and antiviral 
patients  who have completed at least nine months of ampligen r therapy  were able to stay off haart for a total sti duration with a mean time of weeks whereas the control group  which was also taken off haart  but not given ampligen r  had earlier hiv rebound with a mean duration of weeks 
thus  on average  ampligen r therapy spared the patients excessive exposure to haart  with its inherent toxicities  for more than weeks 
as more patients are enrolled  the related clinical costs will continue to increase with some offset to our overall expenses due to the diminishing cost of the me cfs clinical trial 
it is difficult to estimate the duration or projected costs of these two clinical trials due to the many variables involved  ie patient drop out rate  recruitment of clinical investigators  etc 
the length of the study and costs related to our clinical trials cannot be determined at this time as such will be materially influenced by a the number of clinical investigators needed to recruit and treat the required number of patients  b the rate of accrual of patients and c the retention of patients in the studies and their adherence to the study protocol requirements 
under optimal conditions  the cost of completing the studies could be approximately to million 
the rate of enrollment depends on patient availability and on other products being in clinical trials for the treatment of hiv  as there is competition for the same patient population 
at present  more than fda approved drugs for hiv treatment may compete for available patients 
the length  and subsequently the expense of these studies  will also be determined by an analysis of the interim data  which will determine when completion of the ongoing phase iib is appropriate and whether a phase iii trial be conducted or not 
in case a phase iii study is required  the fda might require a patient population exceeding the current one which will influence the cost and time of the trial 
accordingly  the number of unknowns is sufficiently great to be unable to predict when  or whether  we may obtain revenues from our hiv treatment indications 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses g a were  during the year ended december   which includes  of expenses relating to our new alferon division and  for a non cash stock compensation charge 
excluding the alferon expenses  our g a costs were  compared to  of expenses in this increase of  is primarily due to the recovery of certain legal expenses in of approximately  related to the asensio lawsuit and trial from our insurance carrier 
this recovery produced a one time reduction in g a expenses for also  we recorded non cash stock compensation expenses of  in as compared to  in equity loss unconsolidated affiliates in the year ended december   we recorded a non cash charge of  to operations with respect to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
 of these charges were related to our investment in red these charges were the result of our determination that red s business and financial position had deteriorated to the point that our investment had been permanently impaired 
we also recorded a non cash charge of  with respect to our investment in chronix biomedical 
this impairment reduced our carrying value in this investment to reflect a permanent decline in chronix s market value based on its then proposed investment offering 
these charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption equity loss in unconsolidated affiliate 
please see research and development collaborative agreements in item business for more details on these transactions 
other income expense interest and other income totaled  in compared to  recorded in lower cash available for investment basically accounted for the difference as interest rates remained relatively low in all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities 
interest expense and financing costs interest expense and financing costs were  in non cash financing costs consist of  for the amortization of debenture closing costs   for the amortization of original issue discounts and  for the amortization of costs associated with beneficial conversion features of the debentures and the fair value of the warrants relating to the march  july and october convertible debentures 
these charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption financing costs 
please see note in the consolidated financial statements contained herein for more details on these transactions 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  amounted to  substantially from proceeds from debenture offerings  the sale of common stock and the exercising of common stock warrants 
as of december   we had approximately  million in cash and short term investments 
these funds should be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements including debt service for the near term 
however  we may need to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources in order to complete the necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval processes including the commercializing of ampligen r products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds from these or other sources  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
also  we have the ability to curtail discretionary spending  including some research and development activities  if required to conserve cash 
please see recent financing and asset acquisitions in item business and note acquisition of assets of interferon sciences  inc and note debenture financing in the consolidated financial statements contained herein for more details on our acquisition of assets and debenture and stock financings 
because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time

we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory process  and higher than anticipated expenses and lower than anticipated revenues from certain of our clinical trials for which cost recovery from participants has been approved

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results are the following revenue revenues for non refundable license fees are recognized under the performance method expected revenue 
this method considers the total amount of expected revenue during the performance period  but limits the amount of revenue recognized in a period to total non refundable cash received to date 
this limitation is appropriate because future milestone payments are contingent on future events 
upon receipt  the upfront non refundable payment is deferred 
the non refundable upfront payments plus non refundable payments arising from the achievement of defined milestones are recognized as revenue over the performance period based on the lesser of a percentage of completion or b non refundable cash earned including the upfront payment 
this method requires the computation of a ratio of cost incurred to date to total expected costs and then apply that ratio to total expected revenue 
the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the total non refundable cash received to date 
revenue from the sale of ampligen r under cost recovery clinical treatment protocols approved by the fda is recognized when the treatment is provided to the patient 
revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product is shipped  as title is transferred to the customer 
we have no other obligation associated with our products once shipment has occurred 
patents and trademarks patents and trademarks are stated at cost primarily legal fees and are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years we review our patents and trademark rights periodically to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent and trademark s ultimate revenue and profitability potential on an undiscounted cash basis to support the realizability of our respective capitalized cost 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into our strategic business plans 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risks consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being credit worthy  or in short term money markets  which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risks 
at times  we have bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements that exceed federally insured limits 
concentration of credit risk  with respect to receivables  is limited through our credit evaluation process

our receivables consist principally of amounts due from wholesale drug companies as of december  item a
