item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business we are the largest online movie rental subscription service providing more than  subscribers access to a comprehensive library of more than  movie  television and other filmed entertainment titles 
our standard subscription plan of per month allows subscribers to have up to three titles out at the same time with no due dates  late fees or shipping charges 
subscribers select titles at our web site www 
netflix 
com aided by our proprietary recommendation service  receive them on dvd by us mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers 
after a title has been returned  we mail the next available title in a subscriber s queue 
key business metrics for the year ended december   we generated total revenues of million and net income of million 
management periodically reviews certain key business metrics in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
these key business metrics include the following churn churn is a monthly measure defined as customer cancellations in the quarter divided by the sum of beginning subscribers and gross subscriber additions  then divided by three months 
customer cancellations in the quarter include cancellations from gross subscriber additions  which is why we include gross subscriber additions in the denominator 
we grow our subscriber base either by adding new subscribers or by retaining existing subscribers 
churn is the key metric which allows management to evaluate whether we are retaining our existing subscribers in accordance with our business plans 
an 
table of contents 
index to financial statements increase in churn may signal a deterioration in the quality of our service  or it may signal an unfavorable behavioral change in the mix of new subscribers 
lower churn means higher customer retention  faster revenue growth and lower marketing expenses as a percent of revenues for any given level of subscriber acquisition 
subscriber acquisition cost subscriber acquisition cost is defined as total marketing expense divided by total gross subscriber additions 
management reviews this metric closely to evaluate how effective our marketing programs are in acquiring new subscribers on an economical basis 
gross margin management reviews gross margin in conjunction with churn and subscriber acquisition cost to target a desired operating margin 
for example  movie rentals per average paying subscriber may increase  which depresses our gross margin 
however  increased movie rentals per average paying subscriber may result in higher subscriber satisfaction  which reduces churn and increases word of mouth advertising about our service 
as a result  marketing expense may fall as a percentage of revenues and operating margins rise  offsetting the impact of a reduction in gross margin 
we can also make trade offs between our dvd library investments which have an inverse relationship with churn and subscriber acquisition cost 
for example  an increase in our dvd library investments may improve customer satisfaction and lower churn  and hence increase the number of new subscribers acquired via word of mouth 
this in turn may allow us to accelerate our subscriber growth for a given level of marketing spending 
please see results of operations below for further discussion on these key business metrics 
recent developments and initiatives we continue to experience aggressive direct competition from blockbuster 
in particular  blockbuster cut its standard subscription price twice during the last quarter of and currently has a price below our standard price 
in addition  blockbuster has begun television advertising of its online offering 
we also anticipate that other entrants  such as amazon 
com  will offer competing services  either directly or in conjunction with others 
despite this dynamic competitive landscape  we do not intend to lose our leadership position 
while we aim to maintain domestic market leadership in the face of aggressive competition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively 
if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors  our business will be adversely affected and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share  revenues or profitability 
we continue to invest resources to develop solutions for downloading movies to consumers 
our core strategy has been and remains to grow a large dvd subscription business  however  as technology and infrastructure develop to allow effective and convenient delivery of movies over the internet  we intend to offer our subscribers the choice under one subscription of receiving their movies on dvd or by downloading  whichever they prefer 
although our solutions may be well in advance of meaningful demand for downloading services and we expect only modest consumer interest for the near term  we believe the demand for this technology will grow steadily over the next ten years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are

index to financial statements based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
amortization of dvd library and upfront costs we acquire dvds from studios and distributors through either direct purchases or revenue sharing agreements 
the revenue sharing agreements enable us to obtain dvds at a lower upfront cost than under traditional direct purchase arrangements 
under the revenue sharing agreements  we share a percentage of the actual net revenues generated by the use of each particular title with the studios over a fixed period of time  or the title term  which is typically twelve months for each dvd title 
at the end of the title term  we generally have the option of returning the dvd title to the studio  destroying the title or purchasing the title 
in addition  we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios and distributors under revenue sharing agreements 
this payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized and amortized in accordance with our dvd library amortization policy 
in some cases  this payment also includes a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is charged to expense as future revenue sharing obligations are incurred 
we amortize our dvd library  less estimated salvage value  on a sum of the months accelerated basis over its estimated useful life 
the useful life of the new release dvds and back catalogue dvds is estimated to be year and years  respectively 
in estimating the useful life of our dvd library  we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds 
prior to july   we amortized the cost of our entire dvd library  including the capitalized portion of the initial fixed license fee  on a sum of the months accelerated basis over one year 
however  based on our periodic evaluation of both new release and back catalogue utilization for amortization purposes  we determined that back catalogue titles have a significantly longer life than previously estimated 
as a result  we have revised our estimate of useful life for the back catalogue dvd library from a sum of the months accelerated method using a one year life to the same accelerated method of amortization using a three year life 
the purpose of this change is to more accurately reflect the productive life of these assets 
in accordance with apb  the change in life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis from july  new releases will continue to be amortized over a one year period 
as a result of the change in the estimated life of the back catalogue library  total cost of revenues was million lower  net income was million higher and net income per diluted share was higher for the year ended december  we believe the use of the accelerated method is appropriate for the amortization of our dvd library and the initial fixed license fee because it approximates dvd utilization 
in addition  we have also determined that we are selling fewer previously rented dvds than estimated but at an average selling price higher than historically estimated 
we have therefore revised our estimate of salvage values  on direct purchase dvds 
for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives  a salvage value of per dvd has been provided effective july  for those dvds that we do not expect to sell  no salvage value is provided 
simultaneously with the change in estimate of expected salvage value we recorded a write off of approximately million related to non recoverable salvage value 
as a result of this write off  total cost of revenues was million higher  net income was million lower and net income per diluted share was lower for the year ended december  we will continue to periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvd library 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation expenses in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

during  and  we recorded total stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the application of sfas no 
requires significant judgment  including the determination of the expected life and volatility for stock options 
to determine the expected life  we review the historical pattern of exercises of stock options as well as the terms and vesting periods of the options granted 
prior to the third quarter of  we granted stock options  which generally vest over three to four year periods 
since the third quarter of  we began granting fully vested stock options to our employees on a monthly basis 
as a result  we changed the expected life from years to years 
in the second quarter of  we revised our estimate of expected life based on our review of historical patterns for exercises of stock options 
we bifurcated our option grants into two employee groupings who exhibited different exercise behavior and changed the estimate of the expected life from years for all option grants in the first quarter of to year for one group and years for the other group beginning in the second quarter of in addition  our stock price has fluctuated significantly in recent periods 
in estimating expected volatility  we consider historical volatility  volatility in market traded options on our common stock and other relevant factors in accordance with sfas no 
the black scholes option pricing model  used by us  requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
our deferred tax assets  primarily the tax benefits of these loss carryforwards  have been offset by a full valuation allowance because of our history of losses through the first quarter of  limited profitable quarters to date and the competitive landscape of online dvd rentals 
if we subsequently determine that some or all deferred tax assets that were previously offset by a valuation allowance are realizable  the result would be a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
descriptions of statement of operations components subscription revenues we generate all our subscription revenues in the united states 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees and recognize subscription revenues ratably during each subscriber s monthly subscription period 
we record refunds to subscribers as a reduction of revenues 
in addition to our standard service of per month  we offer other service plans with different price points that allow subscribers to keep either fewer or more titles at the same time 
as of december   more than percent of our paying subscribers paid or more per month 
cost of subscription revenues we acquire titles for our library through traditional direct purchase and through revenue sharing agreements with content providers 
traditional buying methods normally result in higher upfront costs than titles obtained through revenue sharing agreements 
cost of subscription revenues consists of revenue sharing expenses

index to financial statements amortization of our library  amortization of intangible assets related to equity instruments issued to certain studios in and and postage and packaging costs related to shipping titles to paying subscribers 
costs related to free trial subscribers are allocated to marketing expenses 
revenue sharing expenses 
our revenue sharing agreements generally commit us to pay an initial upfront fee for each dvd acquired and also a percentage of revenue earned from such dvd rentals for a defined period of time 
a portion of the initial upfront fees are non recoupable for revenue sharing purposes and capitalized and amortized in accordance with our dvd library amortization policy 
the remaining portion of the initial upfront fee represents prepaid revenue sharing and this amount is expensed as revenue sharing expenses as dvds subject to revenue sharing agreements are shipped to subscribers 
other than the initial upfront payment for dvds acquired  we are not obligated to pay any minimum revenue sharing fee on dvds that are not shipped to subscribers 
we characterize these payments to the studios as revenue sharing expenses 
amortization of dvd library 
on july   we revised the estimate of useful life for the back catalogue dvd library from one to three years 
new releases will continue to be amortized over a one year period 
we also revised our estimate of salvage values  on direct purchase dvds 
for those direct purchase dvds that we expect to sell at the end of their useful lives  a salvage value of per dvd has been provided effective july  for those dvds that we do not expect to sell  no salvage value is provided 
amortization of intangible assets 
in  in connection with signing revenue sharing agreements with columbia tristar home entertainment  dreamworks international distribution and warner home video  we agreed to issue to each of these studios our series f non voting preferred stock equal to percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding 
in  in connection with signing revenue sharing agreements with twentieth century fox home entertainment and universal studios home video  we agreed to issue to each of the two studios our series f non voting preferred stock equal to percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding 
as of december   the aggregate of series f non voting preferred stock granted to these five studios equaled percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding 
our obligation to maintain the studios equity interests at percent of our fully diluted equity securities outstanding terminated immediately prior to our initial public offering in may the studios series f preferred stock automatically converted into  shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering 
we measured the original issuances and any subsequent adjustments using the fair value of the securities at the issuance and any subsequent adjustment dates 
the fair value was recorded as an intangible asset and is amortized to cost of subscription revenues ratably over the remaining term of the agreements which initial terms were either three or five years 
postage and packaging 
postage and packaging expenses consist of the postage costs to mail titles to and from our paying subscribers and the packaging and label costs for the mailers 
the rate for first class postage was prior to june  and increased to thereafter 
it is currently anticipated that the us postal service will seek an increase in the rate of first class postage and that any such increase would likely be effective starting in operating expenses fulfillment 
fulfillment expenses represent those expenses incurred in operating and staffing our shipping and customer service centers  including costs attributable to receiving  inspecting and warehousing our library 
fulfillment expenses also include credit card fees 
technology and development 
technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related expenses we incur related to testing  maintaining and modifying our web site  our recommendation service  developing solutions for downloading movies to subscribers  telecommunications systems and infrastructure and other internal use software systems 
technology and development expenses also include depreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our web site and store our data

 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no

we elected to apply the retroactive restatement method under sfas no 
and all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the compensation costs that would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
been applied to all awards granted 
during the third quarter of  we began granting stock options to our employees on a monthly basis 
the vesting periods provide for options to vest immediately  in comparison with the three to four year vesting periods for stock options granted prior to the third quarter of as a result of immediate vesting  all stock based compensation expense determined under sfas no 
is fully recognized upon the grant of the stock option 
for those stock options granted prior to the third quarter of with three to four year vesting periods  we continue to amortize the deferred compensation related to those stock options over the remaining vesting periods
