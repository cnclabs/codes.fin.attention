overview of our business the operating revenue of the company s stations is derived primarily from advertising revenue and  to a much lesser extent  from compensation paid by the networks to its affiliated stations for broadcasting network programming 
advertising is sold for placement within and adjoining a station s network and locally originated programming 
advertising is sold in time increments and is priced primarily on the basis of a program s popularity among the specific audience an advertiser desires to reach  as measured principally by periodic audience surveys 
in addition  advertising rates are affected by the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the size and demographic makeup of the market served by the station and the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area 
rates are highest during the most desirable viewing hours  with corresponding reductions during other hours 
the ratings of a local station affiliated with a national television network can be affected by ratings of network programming 
most advertising contracts are short term  and generally run only for a few weeks 
approximately of the gross revenue of the company s stations was generated from local advertising  which is sold by a station s sales staff directly to local accounts 
the remainder of the advertising revenue primarily represents national advertising  which is sold by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  adam young inc ayi  a national advertising sales representative 
the stations generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising 
expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions  as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities 
this could cause our revenues or operating results to decline significantly in any given period 
the advertising revenue of the company s stations are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered election years due to spending by political candidates  which spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter 
the stations primary operating expenses are for employee compensation  news gathering  production  programming and promotion costs 
a high proportion of the operating expenses of the stations are fixed 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
management has determined the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the company uses significant estimates in determing the allowance for doubtful accounts  the amortization of programming contracts  the evaluation of intangible assets and pension benefit obligations and costs 
revenue recognition 
as discussed above  the operating revenue of the company s stations is derived primarily from advertising revenue  which represented approximately  and of the company s total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
advertising revenues advertising revenues are recognized net of agency commissions and in the period in which the commercial is broadcast 
barter and trade revenues are also included in advertising revenues and are also recognized when the commercials are broadcast 
network compensation five of the company s ten stations are affiliated with abc  three are affiliated with cbs and one is affiliated with nbc 
the company is currently negotiating new network affiliation agreements with respect to the five stations affiliated with abc and the one station affiliated with nbc 
the company has renewed its affiliation with cbs for two of its stations 
under the old network affiliation agreements  revenue was recognized when the company s stations broadcast specific network programming based on a negotiated value for each program 
as renewed affiliation agreements are completed  network compensation may vary from one year to the next and is expected to be significantly reduced from current levels 
network compensation is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
refer to liquidity and capital resources other revenue the company generates revenue from other sources  which include commercial production  trade shows  rental income from tower space and other miscellaneous revenues 
accounts receivable 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
initially  the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt expense 
this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of specific customer s inability to meets its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivables is generally limited due to the large number of geographically diverse customers  individually small balance and short payment terms 
experience has been that customer defaults have been consistent with the company s accrual of bad debt expense and that the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover the likely exposure to such defaults 
programming 
program rights represent the right to air various forms of existing programming 
program rights and the corresponding contractual obligations are recorded when the license period begins and the program is available for use 
program rights are carried at the lower of unamortized costs or estimated net realizable value 
the company s accounting for long lived program assets requires judgment as to the likelihood that such assets will generate sufficient revenue to cover the associated expense 
many of the company s program commitments are for syndicated shows which are produced by syndicators to be aired on a first run basis 
such shows do not generally stay in production if they do not attract a significant audience 
if the syndicator cancels a show  the company s liability for future payments is eliminated 
accordingly  the company has generally not experienced significant write downs from programming commitments 
intangible assets fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements 
intangible assets include fcc broadcast licenses  network affiliations and other intangible assets 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
to assist the company in evaluating our intangible assets  we utilize the service of an independent valuation consulting firm 
fcc licenses are valued using a greenfield income approach 
under this approach  the fcc license is valued by analyzing the estimated after tax discounted future cash flows of the station 
the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models reflect historical station performance  industry standards and trends in the respective markets 
an analysis of the financial multiples for publicly traded broadcasting companies  as well as a comparable sales analysis of television station sales was also utilized to confirm the results of the income approach 
the company adopted this methodology to value broadcast licenses as the company believes this methodology has  in recent years  become the methodology generally used within the broadcast industry to value fcc licenses 
if these estimates or related assumptions materially change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for these assets 
pension assumptions 
pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions 
the assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses include discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  difference between actual results and assumptions are accumulated and amortized as part of net periodic pension costs over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expenses and the recorded obligation in future periods 
to compute the company s benefit obligation as of the measurement date of december   the company used the discount rate of and a rate of compensation increase of 
to compute the company s pension expense in the year ended december   the company used a discount rate of  an expected return on plan assets of and a rate of compensation increase of 
in calculating the company s pension expense for the year ended december   the company used an assumed expected long term rate of return of

the company recorded a gain from the sale of wtvo tv for the year ended december  of million  net of a provision for income taxes of  and a deferred gain of approximately million 
see note for the year ended december   the company recorded a million benefit from income taxes related to the reversal of prior year overprovision for state taxes 
at december   the company had net operating loss nol carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately million expiring at various dates through capital obligations and other commercial commitments the company has obligations and commitments under its long term debt agreements and instruments to make future payments of principal and interest 
the company also has obligations and commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services 
these arrangements secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations 
under generally accepted accounting principles  certain of these arrangements ie  programming contracts that are currently available for airing are recorded as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet  while others ie  operating lease arrangements and programming not currently available are not reflected as liabilities 
the following tables summarize separately the company s material obligations and commitments at december  and the timing of payments required in connection therewith and the effect that such payments are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
the company expects to fund these obligations with cash on hand  cash flow from operations and funds available under its senior credit facility

impact of recently issued accounting standards on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statements no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company expects to adopt statement r for the second quarter ended june  statement no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on requirements of statement for all rewards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt statement using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by fas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r will have a significant impact on our results from operations  although it will not impact our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it all depends on the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted statement r in prior periods the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in september  the emerging issue task force eitf issued topic no 
d use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill topic d 
topic d requires the direct value method  rather than the residual value method  be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill for such assets acquired in business combinations completed after september  under the residual value method  the fair value of the intangible asset is determined to be the difference between the enterprise value and the fair value of separately identifiable assets  whereas  under the direct value method all intangible assets are valued separately and directly 
topic d also requires that registrants who have applied the residual method to the valuation of intangible assets for purposes of impairment testing shall perform an impairment test using the direct value method on all intangible assets no later than the beginning of fiscal years beginning after december  though early adoption is permissible 
impairments resulting from the application of the direct value method and the related tax effects should be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the provisions of topic d did not affect the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s senior credit facility  with no amounts outstanding as of december   bears interest at floating rates 
accordingly  to the extent there are amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility  we are exposed to potential losses related to changes in interest rates 
the company s senior subordinated notes of approximately million outstanding as of december  are general unsecured obligations of the company and are subordinated in right of payment to all senior debt  including all indebtedness of the company under the senior credit facility and the senior notes 
the senior subordinated notes have fixed rates of interest ranging from to and are ten year notes maturing in various years commencing the annualized interest expense on the outstanding senior subordinated notes is approximately million 
the company s senior notes of approximately million outstanding as of december  have a fixed rate of interest of and mature in the annualized interest expense on the outstanding senior notes is approximately million 
at december   the senior notes were trading in the public market with an ask price of at december   the senior subordinated notes due and the senior subordinated notes due were trading in the public market with ask prices of and  respectively 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  however  in order to manage its exposure to interest rate risk  the company entered into derivative financial instruments in june these derivative financial instruments are interest rate swap agreements that expire in the company does not apply hedge accounting to these instruments 
risks factors the company has substantial debt and has significant interest payment requirements the company has a substantial amount of debt 
the following table shows certain important credit statistics about the company 
december  dollars in millions total debt stockholders deficit the company s high level of debt could have important consequences  including the following the company may have difficulty borrowing money for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes  the company will need to use a large portion of its revenues to pay interest on its senior subordinated notes  senior notes and  to the extent outstanding  borrowings under its senior credit facility  which will reduce the amount of money available to finance its operations  capital expenditures and other activities  some of the company s debt may have a variable rate of interest  which would expose the company to the risk of increased interest rates the company is vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in its business  the company is less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including increased competition and demand for new products and services 
subject to restrictions in the company s senior credit facility  and the indentures governing the company s senior notes and senior subordinated notes  the company may also incur significant amounts of additional debt some or all of which may be secured debt for working capital  for capital expenditures  in connection with its strategic acquisitions  expansion through internal growth and other purposes 
if additional debt is incurred  the risks related to the company s high level of debt could intensify 
at december   the company had no senior secured debt outstanding excluding approximately  of capital lease obligations  million of senior unsecured debt outstanding and million of senior subordinated debt outstanding 
in addition  at december   the company had the ability to borrow million under its senior credit facility 
the company depends on the cash flow of its subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations  including its debt obligations the company s operations are conducted through direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries  which guarantee its debt  jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally 
as a holding company  the company owns no significant assets other than its equity in its subsidiaries and is dependent upon the cash flow of its subsidiaries to meet its obligations 
accordingly  the company s ability to make interest and principal payments when due and its ability to purchase its notes upon a change of control is dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries  which may be restricted by the terms of existing and future senior secured indebtedness of its subsidiaries  including the terms of existing and future guarantees of its indebtedness given by its subsidiaries 
covenant restrictions under the company s senior credit facility and its indentures may limit its ability to operate its business the company s senior credit facility and the indentures governing its senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain  among other things  covenants that may restrict the company s ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
the company s senior credit facility and its indentures restrict  among other things  the company s ability to borrow money  pay dividends or make distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments and extend credit  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  consummate certain asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets  and create liens on its assets 
in addition  the company s senior credit facility requires the company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests that may require that the company take action to reduce its debt or to act in a manner contrary to its business objectives 
events beyond the company s control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect it ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests 
the company cannot assure that it will meet those tests or that its senior lenders will waive any failure to meet those tests 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the company s senior credit facility and its indentures 
if an event of default under the company s senior credit facility occurs  the company s senior lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
the company s business in the past has been adversely affected by national and local economic conditions the television industry is cyclical in nature 
because the company relies upon sales of advertising time at its stations for substantially all of its revenues  the company s operating results are susceptible to prevailing economic conditions at both the national and regional levels 
in the past  the company s revenues have been adversely affected by the national recessionary environment 
since a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from local advertisers  its operating results in individual markets may be adversely affected by local and regional economic developments 
the performance of kron tv has a large proportionate impact on the company s operating results 
consequently  the company is particularly susceptible to economic conditions in the san francisco advertising market 
while revenues in at kron tv were stronger than those in  the continuing uncertain economic climate in the san francisco market makes the outlook unclear 
the company is dependent on networks for its programming  and the loss of one or more of the company s affiliations would disrupt its business and could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations by reducing station revenue at the effected station s five of the company s ten stations are affiliated with the abc television network  three are affiliated with the cbs television network  one is affiliated with the nbc television network and one station is independent 
the television viewership levels for stations other than kron tv san francisco  california  the company s only independent television station  are materially dependent upon programming provided by these major networks and are particularly dependent upon programming provided by the abc network 
each of the company s stations other than kron tv is a party to an affiliation agreement with one of the networks  giving the station the right to rebroadcast programs transmitted by the network 
the networks currently pay each affiliated station a fee for each hour of network programming broadcast by the stations in exchange for the networks right to sell the majority of the commercial time during such programming 
the network affiliation agreements relating to eight of our nine affiliated stations expired in the fourth quarter of the company has renewed its affiliation with cbs with respect to wlns tv and klfy tv for eight years to expire on september  under renewed cbs affiliations  the company will be receiving significantly less network compensation than it recieved from cbs under the expired agreements 
during the first quarter of the company received notice from nbc with respect to kwqc tv and from abc with respect to wkrn tv  wten tv  wric tv  wate tv and wbay tv  that the respective network would not renew the affiliation agreements then in place and that the networks wished to negotiate new agreements 
the agreement with nbc expired on november   and the agreements with abc expired on september  negotiations with both abc and nbc are ongoing 
the company is operating under extensions of both the abc and nbc affiliation agreements that have been extended through april  and march   respectively 
while the company is unable to predict the terms of the renewed abc and nbc affiliation agreements  the company believes that renewed affiliations will be in place by june   but on terms that offer less network compensation to the stations than was provided under the expired agreements 
in the event  however  of the company s inability to maintain their current affiliation agreements for any one or more of these stations  the respective station may no longer be able to carry programming of the relevant network 
this loss in network programming would require the company to obtain replacement programming  which may involve higher costs and which may not be as attractive to audiences  resulting in reduced advertising revenues 
additionally  the company would be required to write off the net book value of its intangible assets associated with the network affiliation agreements 
as an independent station  kron tv purchases of all of its programming  resulting in proportionately higher programming costs for the station 
the company may be exposed in the future to volatile or increased programming costs that may adversely affect its operating results 
further  programs are usually purchased for broadcasting for two to three year periods  making it difficult to accurately predict how a program will perform 
in some instances  programs must be replaced before their cost has been fully amortized  resulting in write offs that increase station operating costs 
the company may experience disruptions in it business if it acquires and integrates new television stations as part of the company s business strategy  the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire television stations 
if the expected operating efficiencies from acquisition do not materialize  it the company fails to integrate new stations or recently acquired stations into its existing business  or if the costs of such integration exceed expectation  the company s operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if the company makes acquisitions in the future  it may need to incur more debt or issue more equity securities  and the company may incur contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to definite lived intangible assets 
any of these occurrences could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition 
the departure of one or more of the company s key personnel could impair its ability to effectively operate its business or pursue its business strategies the company is substantially dependent upon the retention of  and the continued performance by  its senior management 
the loss of the services of vincent j 
young  chairman  deborah a 
mcdermott  president  or james a 
morgan  executive vice president and chief financial officer  could have an adverse impact on the company 
the company s business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation  which may restrict its ability to pursue the company s business strategy and or increase its operating expenses the company s television operations are subject to significant regulation by the federal communications commission act of  as senior 
a television station may not operate without the authorization of the fcc 
approval of the fcc is required for the issuance  renewal and transfer of station operating licenses 
in particular  the company s business will be dependent upon its ability to continue to hold television broadcasting licenses from the fcc 
fcc licenses to operate broadcast television stations generally have a term of eight years 
while in the vast majority of cases such licenses are renewed by the fcc  there can be no assurance that the company s licenses will be renewed at their expiration dates or  if renewed  that the renewal terms will be for the maximum permitted period 
the non renewal or revocation of one or more of them company s primary fcc licenses could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
congress and the fcc currently have under consideration  and may in the future adopt  new laws  regulations  and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could  directly or indirectly  affect the operation and ownership of the company s broadcast properties 
the company is unable to predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on its operations 
the company operates in a very competitive business environment the company faces competition from cable television  alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals and satellite delivered programs  including direct broadcast satellite television systems  multipoint multichannel distributions systems  master antenna television systems and satellite master antenna television systems  and other sources of news  information and entertainment such as off air television broadcast programming  streaming video broadcasts over the internet  newspapers  movie theaters  live sporting events and home video products  including videotape cassette recorders and digital video disc players 
in addition to competing with other media outlets for audience share  the company also competes for advertising revenues that comprise the primary source of revenues for its operating subsidiaries 
the company s stations compete for such advertising revenues with other television stations in their respective markets  as well as with other advertising media such as newspapers  radio stations  the internet  magazines  outdoor advertising  transit advertising  yellow page directories  direct mail and local cable systems 
the company s television stations are located in highly competitive markets 
accordingly  the results of the company s operations will be dependent upon the ability of each station to compete successfully in its market  and there can be no assurance that any one of the company s stations will be able to maintain or increase its current audience share or revenue share 
to the extent that certain of the company s competitors have or may  in the future  obtain greater resources  the company s ability to compete successfully in its broadcasting markets my be impeded 
management  as major stockholders  possesses unequal voting rights and control the company s common stock is divided into three classes with different voting rights that allow for the maintenance of control by its management 
each share of class a common stock is entitled to one vote  each share of class b common stock is entitled to ten votes  except for certain significant transactions for which such shares are entitled to one vote per share  and shares of class c common stock are not entitled to vote except in connection with any change to the company s certificate of incorporation that would adversely affect the rights of holders of such common stock 
as of december   there were no shares of class c common stock outstanding 
as of march   vincent young  deborah mcdermott and james morgan  each a director and executive officer of the company  and trust and partnership entities affiliated with and or maintained for the benefit of relatives of vincent young  collectively beneficially possessed shares of class a common stock and class b common stock representing approximately of the total voting power of the company s common stock 
as a result  vincent young  deborah mcdermott  james morgan and such entities collectively have control over the election of a majority of the company s directors and thus  over the company s operations and business 
in addition  such stockholders have the ability to prevent certain types of material transactions  including change of control 
the disproportionate voting rights of the class a common stock relative to class b common stock may make the company a less attractive target for a takeover than the company otherwise might be  or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal or tender offer
