ground volume increased during the year  driven in part by the improving us economy  and reflects growth in both commercial and residential deliveries 
ground volume increased during the first nine months of the year  but slowed to during the fourth quarter 
total next day air volume up and total deferred volume down were both significantly affected by declines in letter volume  but offset by an increase in next day air package volume 
the decline in next day air and deferred letter volume is largely due to the slowdown in mortgage refinancing  which was notably strong in ground revenue per piece increased for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in  but growth was adversely impacted by approximately basis points due to the removal of the fuel surcharge on ground products  as discussed below 
next day air revenue per piece increased  while deferred revenue per piece increased  primarily due to the shift in product mix from letters to packages  the rate increase  and the modified fuel surcharge on domestic air products 
on january   a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years rate increases 
we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of for commercial deliveries 
the ground residential surcharge increased to over the commercial ground rate 
an additional delivery area surcharge of was implemented for commercial deliveries in certain zip codes 
rates for ups hundredweight increased 
in addition  we increased rates for ups next day air an average of and increased rates for deferred services by 
in addition  we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground products  while we began to apply a new indexed surcharge to domestic air products 
this indexed fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the us energy department s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge applied to our air products during was  compared with the average surcharge of applied to both air and ground products in  resulting in an increase in domestic fuel surcharge revenue of million during the year 
us domestic package operating profit increased million  or  primarily due to the increase in volume and revenue growth discussed previously  but somewhat offset by increased aircraft impairment charges million in compared to million in and a million pension charge related to the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data

ground volume increased by in  reversing a decline in  reflecting the improving us economy and the impact that labor negotiations had on lowering volume during portions of the volume for our ups next day air products increased by during the year  driven by double digit growth in overnight letters which was influenced by the strength in mortgage refinancing activity during the increase in us domestic average daily package volume was more significant in the latter half of the year 
in the third and fourth quarters of  total us domestic average daily package volume increased and  respectively 
the overall improvement in revenue per piece was primarily due to the rate increase that became effective in january  with some additional benefit from the fuel surcharge as described below 
the decline in revenue per piece for the next day air products  and the relatively smaller increase for the deferred products  was primarily due to the relatively higher growth in letter volume compared with the growth in package volume for these products 
on january   we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of for commercial deliveries 
the ground residential surcharge increased to over the commercial ground rate

this indexed fuel surcharge for the domestic air products was based on the us energy department s gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel 
us domestic package operating profit declined million  or  primarily due to the slow volume and revenue growth combined with an increase in operating expenses discussed further below under the section titled operating expenses and operating margin 
us domestic package operating profit increased in the third quarter and decreased by in the fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  us domestic package operating profit benefited from a million credit due to a change in our vacation policy for non union employees

rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased an average of 
in january  changes were made to the calculation of our fuel surcharge on international products including us export products 
the surcharge is now indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions  depending on where the shipment takes place 
the current surcharge is only applied to our international express products  while the previous surcharge was applied to all international products 
these changes  along with higher fuel prices  had the effect of increasing international package revenue by million during the year 
we experienced double digit export volume growth in each region throughout the world  with the asia pacific region leading with export volume growth  including a increase in china export volume 
export volume continues to benefit from our expanding international network  such as the six additional flights to shanghai  china that were added in the fourth quarter 
european export volume grew in excess of  and was positively influenced by the addition of countries to the european union 
non us domestic volume increased for the year  and primarily reflects improvements in our european and canadian domestic delivery businesses 
export revenue per piece increased for the year currency adjusted  benefiting from rate increases and the impact of the fuel surcharge 
in total  international average daily package volume increased and average revenue per piece increased currency adjusted 
the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was million  or  for the year  million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations 
this increase in operating profit was primarily due to the strong export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously  and a strong increase in operating margin through better network utilization 
international operating profit was adversely affected by aircraft impairment charges of million in  compared to a million charge in compared to international package revenue improved million  or  for the year due primarily to the volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements  a portion of which can be attributed to the impact of currency 
revenue increased million during the year due to currency fluctuations 
export volume increased throughout the world  with asia pacific  canada  and the americas showing double digit export volume growth  and us and european export volume increasing slightly over 
european export volume growth was adversely impacted by the strength of the euro and the weak european economy 
domestic volume increased for the year  reversing a decline from the previous year  which was also negatively affected by the weak european economy 
export revenue per piece increased for the year currency adjusted  due to improvements in product mix and continued focus on yield management 
in total  international average daily package volume increased and average revenue per piece increased currency adjusted 
the decline in cargo revenue during the year was largely due to a reduction of flights in our air network in the americas

rate changes for shipments originating outside the united states generally are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 
the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was million for the year  million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations

the remainder of our non package operations  which includes mail boxes etc 
the franchisor of mail boxes etc 
and the ups store  ups capital  our mail and consulting services  and our excess value package insurance business  increased revenue by for the year  largely due to strong double digit franchise and royalty revenue growth at mail boxes etc 
resulting from an expanding store base  as well as higher excess value insurance revenue 
menlo worldwide forwarding  which was acquired in december  added million in revenue 
non package operating profit increased million  or  for the year  primarily due to improved results from our ups capital  mail services  and excess value insurance business 
mail boxes etc 
experienced strong profit growth  due to the increased franchise and royalty revenue noted previously 
non package operating profit includes million compared to million in of intersegment profit for the year  with a corresponding amount of operating expense  which reduces operating profit  in the us domestic package segment 
during the second quarter of  we sold our mail technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by million  or per diluted share 
the gain consisted of a pre tax loss of million recorded in other operating expenses within the non package segment  and a tax benefit of million recognized in conjunction with the sale 
the tax benefit exceeded the pre tax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the mail technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes 
consequently  our tax basis was greater than our book basis  thus producing the tax benefit described above 
during the third quarter of  we sold our aviation technologies business unit and recognized a pre tax gain of million million after tax  or per diluted share  which is recorded in other operating expenses within the non package segment 
the operating results of both the mail technologies unit and the aviation technologies unit were previously included in our non package segment  and were not material to our consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented 
compared to non package revenue increased million  or  for the year 
ups supply chain solutions  increased revenue by during the year 
this increase was due to growth in our supply chain management and other logistics businesses  with international revenues growing faster than in the united states  partially as a result of favorable currency fluctuations 
favorable currency fluctuations accounted for million of the increase in revenue 
freight forwarding revenue increased at a slower rate  which was influenced by global economic conditions and increased air revenue in as a result of the work disruption at us west coast ports 
the remainder of our non package operations  which includes mail boxes etc 
the franchisor of mail boxes etc 
and the ups store  ups capital  our mail and consulting services  and our excess value package insurance business  increased revenue by for the year  primarily due to increased franchise revenue at mail boxes etc 
and improvements from our mail innovations unit 
non package operating profit increased million  or  for the year 
this increase was primarily due to higher operating profit from our supply chain solutions unit  which was driven by the increase in revenue as well as the cost savings produced by our integration and restructuring program 
non package operating profit in was reduced by the million restructuring charge and related expenses  and was increased by million due to the change in our vacation policy for non union employees 
non package operating profit includes million compared to million in of intersegment profit  with a corresponding amount of operating expense  which reduces operating profit  in the us domestic package segment 
operating expenses and operating margin compared to consolidated operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and non package segments 
compensation and benefits increased by billion  or  for the year  largely due to increased payroll costs  increased health and welfare expense  and higher pension expense for our union pension plans 
stock based compensation expense increased million  or  during the year  primarily as a result of increased management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of fas prospectively beginning with stock based compensation awards 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  for the year  largely due to a increase in fuel expense and a increase in purchased transportation  but were somewhat offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in fuel expense was primarily due to higher prices for jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  in addition to somewhat higher fuel usage and lower hedging gains 
the increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency  higher fuel prices  and volume growth in our international package business 
the decline in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by lower depreciation expense on aircraft engines  largely due to the retirement of some older aircraft 
the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was affected by increased expense on vehicle parts and airframe and engine maintenance 
the increase in other occupancy expense was largely related to higher rent expense  but somewhat offset by lower real estate taxes 
the increase in other expenses was affected by the million impairment of aircraft  engines  and parts  as well as the million pension charge discussed previously  in addition to higher advertising costs 
our consolidated operating margin  defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue  increased in compared with the operating margins for our three business segments were as follows year ended december  operating segment us domestic package international package non package consolidated compared to consolidated operating expenses increased by billion  or  for the year  million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and non package segments 
compensation and benefits increased by billion  or  for the year  primarily due to increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense 
stock based compensation expense totaled million in  a increase over  primarily as a result of increased management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of fas for stock based compensation awards 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  for the year  largely due to a increase in occupancy costs  a increase in fuel expense  and smaller increases in purchased transportation  repairs and maintenance  and depreciation and amortization 
other operating expenses in were affected by the million restructuring charge and related expenses incurred in the integration of our freight services and logistics group operations into our ups supply chain solutions unit 
the growth in other occupancy expense was impacted by higher rent expense on buildings and facilities  higher real estate taxes  and weather related increases in natural gas and utilities expense 
the fuel expense increase was due to higher fuel prices in  somewhat offset by hedging gains and lower fuel usage 
the increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency and growth in our international package and supply chain solutions businesses 
the growth in depreciation and amortization reflects the addition of new aircraft  the completion of facilities projects including ups worldport  and increased amortization of capitalized software 
the increase in repairs and maintenance was primarily due to higher vehicle  aircraft  and equipment maintenance expense 
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to a million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of  resulting from an impairment evaluation performed when we permanently removed a number of boeing and dc aircraft from service 
investment income interest expense compared to investment income increased by million during the year  primarily due to a million impairment charge recognized during we periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors  including the extent and duration to which a security s fair value has been less than its cost  overall economic and market conditions  and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer 
during the first quarter of  after considering the continued decline in the us equity markets  we recognized an impairment charge of million  primarily related to our investment in s p equity portfolios 
investment income also increased in due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances  but was somewhat offset by increased equity method losses on certain investment partnerships 
the million increase in interest expense during was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate debt and certain interest rate swaps  as well as the impact of currency exchange rates and imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships 
the impact of higher interest rates was somewhat offset by lower average debt balances outstanding in compared to in december  we redeemed million in cash settled convertible senior notes at a price of  and also terminated the swap transaction associated with the notes 
the redemption amount paid was lower than the amount recorded for the fair value of the notes at the time of redemption  which  along with the cash settlement received on the swap  resulted in a million non operating gain recorded in results 
compared to the decrease in investment income of million in is primarily due to the million impairment charge recognized during the first quarter of the million decline in interest expense in was primarily the result of lower commercial paper balances outstanding  lower interest rates on variable rate debt  and lower floating rates on interest rate swaps 
net income and earnings per share compared to net income was billion  a increase from the billion in  resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to in from in net income in was adversely impacted by a million after tax impairment charge per diluted share on boeing   and mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft  engines  and parts  as well as a million after tax charge per diluted share to pension expense resulting from the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data 
net income was positively impacted by credits to income tax expense totaling million per diluted share related to various items  including the resolution of certain tax matters  the removal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards  and an adjustment for identified tax contingency items 
net income in was favorably impacted by the million after tax gain per diluted share on the sale of mail technologies  the million after tax gain per diluted share on the sale of aviation technologies  and the million after tax gain per diluted share recognized upon redemption of our million cash settled senior convertible notes 
net income in was adversely impacted by the million after tax investment impairment charge per diluted share described previously 
net income in was also favorably impacted by reductions in income tax expense of million per diluted share due to the resolution of various tax issues with the irs  a favorable court ruling on the tax treatment of jet engine maintenance costs  and a lower effective state tax rate 
compared to net income for was billion  a decrease of million from the billion achieved in  resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share to in from in net income in was affected by the items noted above 
net income in was favorably impacted by a million after tax per diluted share benefit resulting from the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability  and by million after tax per diluted share from the credit to expense as a result of the change in our vacation policy for non union employees 
net income in was adversely impacted by million after tax per diluted share due to the restructuring charge and related expenses and by million after tax per diluted share due to the fas cumulative expense adjustment 
liquidity and capital resources net cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and billion in  and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows compared with was primarily due to higher net income  decreased pension and retirement plan fundings  and cash received upon the resolution of various tax matters 
in  we funded million to our pension plans as compared to billion in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  projected pension contributions to plan trusts in are approximately million 
in  we received million from our previously disclosed settlement with the internal revenue service irs primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance for tax years and see contingencies section below 
as of december   we had a million receivable recorded for the settlement related to tax years on october   we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that will take effect on january  we increased rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  ups day select  and ups ground 
we also increased rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service 
other pricing changes include an increase of for delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 
the residential surcharge will increase for ups ground services and for ups next day air  ups nd day air and ups day select 
these rate changes are customary  and are consistent with previous years rate increases 
additionally  in january we will modify the fuel surcharge on domestic and international air services by setting a maximum cap of 
a fuel surcharge of will be applied to ups ground services that will fluctuate after january based on the us energy department s on highway diesel fuel price 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was   and billion in  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the increased cash used in investing activities has been the increasing net purchases of marketable securities  due to the excess of cash generated over our capital investment needs 
the increase in funds used for business acquisitions is primarily due to the menlo worldwide forwarding and ups yamato express co 
acquisitions in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cash generated from finance receivables was primarily due to principal payments on finance receivables and sales of portions of our portfolio  primarily in the receivable factoring business 
capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities  as follows in millions buildings and facilities aircraft and parts vehicles information technology as described in the commitments section below  we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft  vehicles  equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 
we fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 
net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was  and billion in  and  respectively 
our primary use of cash in financing activities has been to repurchase stock  pay dividends  and repay long term debt 
in october  a total of billion was authorized for share repurchases as part of our continuing share repurchase program 
as of december   billion of this authorization was available for future share repurchases 
we repurchased a total of billion of common stock in we increased our cash dividends per share to in from in  resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to billion from million 
the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors  including our net income  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects  and other relevant factors 
we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends 
in february  the board of directors declared a per share dividend  which represents a increase over the previous quarterly dividend 
the dividend is payable on march  to shareowners of record on february  during  we repaid million in debt  primarily consisting of million in commercial paper  million in redemptions of ups notes  million in scheduled principal payments on capital lease obligations  and million for the redemption of our singapore dollar notes issue 
issuances of debt primarily consisted of million in commercial paper and million in ups notes 
we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt 
sources of credit we maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion 
approximately billion was outstanding under these programs as of december   with an average interest rate of 
the entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet 
in addition  we maintain an extendable commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to million 
no amounts were outstanding under this program at december  we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks 
these agreements provide revolving credit facilities of billion each  with one expiring on april  and the other on april  interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at day libor plus basis points 
there were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of december  in august  we filed a billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the united states 
there was approximately million issued under this shelf registration statement at december   all of which consists of issuances under our ups notes program 
our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers  however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants 
these covenants generally require us to maintain a billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company 
these covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company  and all covenant tests were passed as of december  commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases  capital leases  debt obligations and purchase commitments 
we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in millions year capitalized leases operating leases debt principal purchase commitments after total in december  we amended our existing aircraft purchase agreement with airbus industries 
the amended agreement will reduce airbus a aircraft on order from to  and the number of options on this aircraft from to zero 
these aircraft remaining on order will be delivered to ups by july additionally  we placed a firm order for airbus a freighter aircraft  and obtained options to purchase additional a aircraft 
the airbus a aircraft will be delivered to ups between and the purchase commitments information above reflects the amended agreement 
in january  we also announced an agreement to purchase an additional boeing md pre owned aircraft 
these aircraft will be delivered to ups between and we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures  such as commitments for aircraft purchases  for the foreseeable future 
contingencies on august   the united states tax court held that we were liable for tax on income of overseas partners ltd  a bermuda company that had reinsured excess value ev insurance purchased by our customers beginning in  and that we were liable for additional tax for the and tax years 
the irs took similar positions to those advanced in the tax court decision for tax years subsequent to through on june   the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the tax court decision 
in january  we and the irs finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to ev package insurance 
under the terms of settlement  we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately million  additions to tax of million and related interest 
the amount due to the irs as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued 
as a result  we recorded income  before taxes  of billion million after tax during the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we received a refund of million pertaining to the and tax years 
the irs had proposed adjustments  unrelated to the ev package insurance matters discussed above  regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses  the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary  the treatment of certain income  and our entitlement to tax credits in the through tax years 
in the third quarter of  we settled all outstanding issues related to each of the tax years through in the fourth quarter of  we received a refund of million pertaining to the through tax years 
we expect to receive the million of refunds related to the through tax years within the next six months 
the irs may take similar positions with respect to some of the non ev package insurance matters for each of the years through if challenged  we expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues 
specifically  we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the irs alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants 
we believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we were named as a defendant in twenty three now dismissed lawsuits that sought to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for ev insurance in connection with package shipments since based on state and federal tort  contract and statutory claims  these cases generally claimed that we failed to remit collected ev premiums to an independent insurer  we failed to provide promised ev insurance  we acted as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations  and the price for ev insurance was excessive 
these actions were all filed after the august  us tax court decision  discussed above  which the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit later reversed 
these twenty three cases were consolidated for pre trial purposes in a multi district litigation proceeding mdl proceeding in federal court in new york 
in addition to the cases in which ups was named as a defendant  there also was an action  smith v 
mail boxes etc  against mail boxes etc 
and its franchisees relating to ups ev insurance and related services purchased through mail boxes etc 
centers 
that case also was consolidated into the mdl proceeding 
in late  the parties reached a global settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the mdl proceeding 
in reaching the settlement  we and the other defendants expressly denied any and all liability 
on july   the court issued an order granting final approval to the substantive terms of the settlement 
no appeals were filed and the settlement became effective on september  pursuant to the settlement  ups has provided qualifying settlement class members with vouchers toward the purchase of specified ups services and will pay the plaintiffs attorneys fees  the total amount of which still remains to be determined by the court 
other defendants have contributed to the costs of the settlement  including the attorneys fees 
the ultimate cost to us of the proposed settlement will depend on a number of factors  including how many vouchers settlement class members actually use 
we do not believe that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state courts containing various class action allegations under state wage and hour laws 
in one of these cases  marlo v 
ups  which has been certified as a class action in california state court  plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime  penalties for missed meal and rest periods  interest and attorneys fees 
plaintiffs purport to represent a class of  full time supervisors 
we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases 
at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in addition  we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business 
we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
we participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements 
several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans  including unfavorable investment performance  changes in demographics  and increased benefits to participants 
at this time  we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions  if any  or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows could result from our participation in these plans 
due to the events of september   increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming  however  we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in addition  our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions  including self insuring certain risks  to mitigate the expense increase 
as of december   we had approximately  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters 
these agreements run through july  the majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association  which became amendable january  negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the national mediation board 
our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which becomes amendable on november  in addition  the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
these agreements run through july  market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of foreign exchange  interest rate  equity and commodity forward contracts  options  and swaps 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves  and commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  which are used in the transportation of packages 
additionally  we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products  primarily natural gas and electricity  used in our operating facilities throughout the world 
we use a combination of options  swaps  and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years 
the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december  and was an asset of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts  assuming a hypothetical change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses  and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year 
as of december  and  the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was a liability of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
interest rate risk as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have issued debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest 
we use a combination of derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps  as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify  and the notional amount  interest payment  and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term primarily libor interest rates 
the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at december  and would be approximately and million  respectively 
as described in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  we have certain investments in debt  auction rate  and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest 
the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december  and would be approximately and million  respectively 
additionally  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 
the potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december  and would be immaterial 
this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios  these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts 
we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 
equity price risk we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk  and for certain of these securities  we utilize options to hedge this price risk 
at december  and  the fair value of such investments was and million  respectively 
the potential change in the fair value of such investments  assuming a change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges  would be approximately and million at december  and credit risk the forward contracts  swaps  and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which replaces fas and supercedes apb fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
we will adopt fas r in the third quarter of  using the prospective method of adoption 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas r 
there will be no impact upon adoption  as we will already be expensing all unvested option and restricted stock awards 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance under fas with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fas we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  we have not adjusted our income tax provision or deferred tax liabilities to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
the adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
fas requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
goodwill impairment the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  in june as a result of the issuance of this standard  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subjected to annual impairment testing 
goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
the estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors  including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units 
upon adoption of fas  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million per diluted share  as of january   related to our mail technologies business 
the primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery business 
in conjunction with our annual test of goodwill in  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million related to our mail technologies business  resulting in total goodwill impairment of million for our annual impairment tests performed in and resulted in no goodwill impairment 
as of december   our recorded goodwill was billion 
self insurance accruals we self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims  automotive liability  health and welfare  and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries  who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
pension and postretirement medical benefits the company s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
financial instruments as discussed in notes    and to our consolidated financial statements  and in the market risk section of this report  we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk 
certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
certain financial instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  are valued using pricing models that consider  among other factors  contractual and market prices  correlations  time value  credit spreads  and yield curve volatility factors 
changes in the fixed income  equity  foreign exchange  and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
depreciation  residual value  and impairment of fixed assets as of december   we had approximately billion of net fixed assets  the most significant category of which is aircraft 
in accounting for fixed assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft  we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions  and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
when appropriate  we evaluate our fixed assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in december  we permanently removed from service a number of boeing and mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft 
as a result  we conducted an impairment evaluation  which resulted in a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft including the related engines  million of which impacted the us domestic package segment and million of which impacted the international package segment 
in december  we permanently removed from service a number of boeing  and mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft 
as a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft  we conducted an impairment evaluation  which resulted in a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft including the related engines and parts  million of which impacted the us domestic package segment and million of which impacted the international package segment 
these charges are classified in the caption other expenses within other operating expenses see note to the consolidated financial statements 
ups continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow 
income taxes we operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions 
we estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these jurisdictions and taking into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes 
the process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events 
the increasing profitability of our international segment increases the significance of our non us income tax provision to our overall effective income tax rate 
we recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years 
realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income subject to any carry forward limitations in the applicable jurisdictions 
we make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based  in part  on estimates of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established for the portion  if any  of the deferred tax assets that we conclude cannot be realized 
income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate 
in this regard  we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict 
the words believes  expects  anticipates  we see  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements include statements regarding our intent  belief and current expectations about our strategic direction  prospects and future results 
we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
risk factors the following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements the effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate  both in the united states and internationally 
our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks 
the impact of competition on a local  regional  national  and international basis 
our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations  various motor carriers  express companies  freight forwarders  air couriers and others 
our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation  and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business 
the impact of complex and stringent aviation  transportation  environmental  labor  employment and other governmental laws and regulations  and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of september  our failure to comply with applicable laws  ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations 
strikes  work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees 
such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs  and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service 
we may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service 
the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations 
possible disruption of supplies  or an increase in the prices  of gasoline  diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors 
we require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products 
cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services
