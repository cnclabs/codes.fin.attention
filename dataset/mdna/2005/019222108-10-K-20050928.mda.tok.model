home respiratory care products 
home respiratory care products represent one of allied s potential growth areas 
allied s broad line of home respiratory care products include aluminum oxygen cylinders  oxygen regulators  pneumatic nebulizers  portable suction equipment and the full line of respiratory disposable products 
medical gas equipment market 
the market for medical gas equipment consists of hospitals  alternate care settings and surgery centers 
the medical gas equipment group is broken down into three separate categories construction products  regulation devices and suction equipment  and disposable cylinders 
construction products 
allied s medical gas system construction products consist of in wall medical system components  central station pumps and compressors  and headwalls 
these products are typically installed during construction or renovation of a health care facility and are built in as an integral part of the facility s physical plant 
typically  the contractor for the facility s construction or renovation purchases medical gas system components from manufacturers and ensures that the design specifications of the health care facility are met 
allied s in wall components  including outlets  manifolds  alarms  ceiling columns and zone valves  serve a fundamental role in medical gas delivery systems 
central station pumps and compressors are individually engineered systems consisting of compressors  reservoirs  valves and controls designed to drive a hospital s medical gas and suction systems 
each system is designed specifically for a given hospital or facility  which purchases pumps and compressors from suppliers 
the company s sales of pumps and compressors are driven  in large part  by its share of the in wall components market 
the company s construction products are sold primarily to hospitals  alternate care settings and hospital construction contractors 
the company believes that it holds a major share of the us market for its construction products  that these products are installed in more than three thousand hospitals in the united states and that its installed base of equipment in this market will continue to generate follow on sales 
the company believes that most hospitals and sub acute care facility construction spending is for expansion or renovation of existing facilities 
many hospital systems and individual hospitals undertake major renovations to upgrade their operations to improve the quality of care they provide  reduce costs and attract patients and personnel 
regulation devices and suction equipment 
the company s medical gas system regulation products include flowmeters  vacuum regulators and pressure regulators  as well as related adapters  fittings and hoses which measure  regulate  monitor and help transfer medical gases from walled piping or equipment to patients in hospital rooms  operating theaters or intensive care areas 
the company s leadership position in the in wall components market provides a competitive advantage in marketing medical gas system regulation devices that are compatible with those components 
portable suction equipment is typically used when in wall suction is not available or when medical protocol specifically requires portable suction 
the company also manufactures disposable suction canisters  which are clear containers used to collect the fluids suctioned by in wall or portable suction systems 
the containers have volume calibrations  which allow the medical practitioner to measure the volume of fluids suctioned 
the market for regulation devices and suction equipment includes hospital and sub acute care facilities 
sales of these products are made through the same distribution channel as our respiratory care products 
the company believes that it holds a significant share of the us market in both regulation devices and suction equipment 
disposable cylinders 
disposable oxygen cylinders are designed to provide oxygen for short periods of time in emergency situations 
since they are not subjected to the same pressurization as standard containers  they are much lighter and less expensive than standard gas cylinders 
the company markets filled disposable oxygen cylinders through industrial safety distributors and similar customers  principally to first aid providers  restaurants  industrial plants and other customers that require oxygen for infrequent emergencies 
emergency medical products market 
emergency medical products are used in the treatment of trauma induced injuries 
the company s emergency medical products provide patient resuscitation or ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or respiratory distress as well as immobilization and treatment for burns 
the company has seen growth in the trauma care venue for health care services  as the trend continues toward providing health care outside the traditional hospital setting 
the company also expects that other countries will develop trauma care systems in the future  although no assurance can be given that such systems will develop or that they will have a favorable impact on the company 
sales of emergency medical products are made through specialized emergency medical products distributors to ambulance companies  fire departments and emergency medical systems volunteer organizations 
the emergency medical products are broken down into two categories respiratory resuscitator products and trauma patient handling products 
respiratory resuscitation products 
the company s respiratory resuscitation products include demand resuscitation valves  portable resuscitation systems  bag masks and related products  emergency transport ventilators  precision oxygen regulators  minilators  multilators and humidifiers 
demand resuscitation valves are designed to provide oxygen to breathing or non breathing patients 
in an emergency situation  they can be used with a mask or tracheotomy tubes and operate from a standard regulated oxygen system 
the company s portable resuscitation systems provide fast  simple and effective means of ventilating a non breathing patient during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and oxygen to breathing patients on demand with minimal inspiratory effort 
the company also markets a full line of disposable and reusable bag mask resuscitators  which are available in a variety of adult and child size configurations 
disposable mouth to mask resuscitation systems have the added advantage of reducing the risk of transmission of communicable diseases 
the company s autovent transport ventilator can meet a variety of needs in different applications ranging from typical emergency medical situations to more sophisticated air and ground transport 
each autovent is accompanied by a patient valve  which provides effective ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or respiratory distress 
when administration of oxygen is required at the scene of a disaster  in military field hospitals or in a multiple victim incident  allied s minilators and multilators are capable of providing oxygen to one or a large number of patients 
to complement the family of respiratory resuscitation products  the company offers a full line of oxygen product accessories 
this line of accessory products includes reusable aspirators  tru fit masks  disposable cuffed masks and related accessories 
trauma and patient handling products 
the company s trauma and patient handling products include spine immobilization products  pneumatic anti shock garments and trauma burn kits 
spine immobilization products include a backboard that is designed for safe immobilization of injury victims and provides a durable and cost effective means of emergency patient transportation and extrication 
the infant pediatric immobilization board is durable and scaled for children 
the half back extractor rescue vest is useful for both suspected cervical spinal injuries and for mountain and air rescues 
the company s pneumatic anti shock garments are used to treat victims experiencing hypovolemic shock 
allied s trauma burn kits contain a comprehensive line of products for the treatment of trauma and burns 
sales and marketing allied sells its products primarily to respiratory care anesthesia product distributors  hospital construction contractors  emergency medical equipment dealers and directly to hospitals 
the company maintains a sales force of sales professionals  all of whom are full time employees of the company 
the sales force includes medical gas specialists  emergency specialists and international sales representatives 
three product managers are responsible for the marketing activities of our product lines 
the medical gas specialists are responsible for sales of all allied products with the exception of emergency products within their territory 
sales of products are accomplished through respiratory care anesthesia distributors for the regulation devices  suction equipment  respiratory care anesthesia products and disposable cylinders 
the homecare products are sold primarily through our own in house telemarketing 
construction products are sold direct to hospital construction contractors and through distributors 
emergency medical specialists are responsible for sales of respiratory resuscitation products  trauma and patient handling products 
these products are principally sold to ambulance companies  fire departments and emergency medical systems volunteer organizations through specialized emergency medical products distributors 
allied s international business represents a potential growth area that the company has been pursuing 
allied s net sales to foreign markets totaled of the company s net sales in fiscal  of the company s net sales in fiscal  and of the company s net sales in fiscal international sales are made through a network of dealers  agents and us exporters who distribute the company s products throughout the world 
allied has market presence in canada  mexico  central and south america  europe  the middle east and the far east 
manufacturing allied s manufacturing processes include fabrication  electro mechanical assembly operations and plastics manufacturing 
a significant part of allied s manufacturing operations involves electro mechanical assembly of proprietary products and the company is vertically integrated in most elements of metal machining and fabrication 
most of allied s hourly employees are involved in machining  metal fabrication  plastics manufacturing and product assembly 
allied manufactures small metal components from bar stock in a machine shop  which includes automatic screw machines  horizontal lathes and drill presses and computer controlled machining centers 
the company makes larger metal components from sheet metal using computerized punch presses  brake presses and shears 
in its plastics manufacturing processes  the company utilizes both extrusion and injection molding 
the company believes that its production facilities and equipment are in good condition and sufficient to meet planned increases in volume over the next few years and that the conditions in local labor markets should permit the implementation of additional shifts and days operated 
research and development allied s research and development group is responsible for the development of new products 
this group is staffed with mechanical and electrical engineers 
during fiscal year the research and development group completed the design and released to manufacturing a new line of lsp regulators 
these regulators are used by ems personnel 
the research and development group has also completed the design of a new hospital alarm system and gas manifold 
these products will be released for sale in the st quarter of fiscal year as part of the agreement relating to the withdrawal of the baralyme r product  abbott has agreed to pay to allied up to  in product development costs to pursue development of a new carbon dioxide absorption product for use in connection with inhalation anesthetics that does not contain potassium hydroxide and does not produce a significant exothermic reaction with currently available inhalation agents 
it is allied s intention to pursue development of a new carbon dioxide absorption product 
as of june  the company had spent  to pursue development of a new carbon dioxide absorbent 
it is the company s expectation that this amount will be reimbursed by abbott 
more detailed information concerning this agreement is included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation the company s products and its manufacturing activities are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by federal and state authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  medical devices for human use are subject to comprehensive review by the united states food and drug administration the fda 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdc act  and other federal statutes and regulations  govern or influence the research  testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of such products 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters  fines  recall or seizure of products  injunction  refusal to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the united states  refusal of the government to clear or approve marketing applications or to allow the company to enter into government supply contracts  or withdrawal of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
the company is required to file a premarket notification in the form of a premarket approval pma with the fda before it begins marketing a new medical device that offers new technology that is currently not on the market 
the company also must file a premarket notification in the form of a k with the fda before it begins marketing a new medical device that utilizes existing technology for devices that are currently on the market 
the k submission process is also required when the company makes a change or modifies an existing device in a manner that could significantly affect the device s safety or effectiveness 
compliance with the regulatory approval process in order to market a new or modified medical device can be uncertain  lengthy and  in some cases  expensive 
there can be no assurance that necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained on a timely basis  or at all 
delays in receipt or failure to receive such approvals  the loss of previously received approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company manufactures and distributes a broad spectrum of respiratory therapy equipment  emergency medical equipment and medical gas equipment 
to date  all of the company s fda clearances have been obtained through the k clearance process 
these determinations are very fact specific and the fda has stated that  initially  the manufacturer is best qualified to make these determinations  which should be based on adequate supporting data and documentation 
the fda however  may disagree with a manufacturer s determination not to file a k and require the submission of a new k notification for the changed or modified device 
where the fda believes that the change or modification raises significant new questions of safety or effectiveness  the agency may require a manufacturer to cease distribution of the device pending clearance of a new k notification 
certain of the company s medical devices have been changed or modified subsequent to k marketing clearance of the original device by the fda 
certain of the company s medical devices  which were first marketed prior to may   and therefore  grandfathered and exempt from the k notification process  also have been subsequently changed or modified 
the company believes that these changes or modifications do not significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness  or make a major change or modification in the devices intended uses and  accordingly  submission of new k notification to the fda is not required 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fda would agree with the company s determinations 
in addition  commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is subject to additional regulatory requirements and receipt of approvals that vary widely from country to country 
the company believes it is in compliance with regulatory requirements of the countries in which it sells its products 
the medical device reporting regulation requires that the company provide information to the fda on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices  as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
the medical device tracking regulation requires the company to adopt a method of device tracking of certain devices  such as ventilators  which are life supporting or life sustaining devices used outside of a device user facility  some of which are permanently implantable devices 
the regulation requires that the method adopted by the company will ensure that the tracked device can be traced from the device manufacturer to the person for whom the device is indicated ie  the patient 
in addition  the fda prohibits a company from promoting an approved device for unapproved applications and reviews a company s labeling for accuracy 
labeling and promotional activities also are in certain instances  subject to scrutiny by the federal trade commission 
the company s medical device manufacturing facilities are registered with the fda  and have received iso certification for the st 
louis facility and certification per the medical device directive mdd european for certain products in as such  the company will be audited by the fda  iso  and european auditors for compliance with the good manufacturing practices gmp  the iso and mdd regulations for medical devices 
these regulations require the company to manufacture its products and maintain its products and documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to design  manufacturing  testing and control activities 
the company also is subject to the registration and inspection requirements of state regulatory agencies 
there can be no assurance that any required fda or other governmental approval will be granted  or  if granted  will not be withdrawn 
governmental regulation may prevent or substantially delay the marketing of the company s proposed products and cause the company to undertake costly procedures 
in addition  the extent of potentially adverse government regulation that might arise from future administrative action or legislation cannot be predicted 
any failure to obtain  or delay in obtaining  such approvals could adversely affect the company s ability to market its proposed products 
sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
medical products shipped to the european community require ce certification 
the letters ce are an abbreviation of conformite europeenne  french for european conformity 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a device by a comparable regulatory authority of a foreign country generally must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing in those countries 
the time required to obtain such approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
in addition  fda approval may be required under certain circumstances to export certain medical devices 
the company has also received iso certification for medical device manufacturers in the company is also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protections  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
third party reimbursement the cost of a majority of medical care in the united states is funded by the us government through the medicare and medicaid programs and by private insurance programs  such as corporate health insurance plans 
although the company does not receive payments for its products directly from these programs  home respiratory care providers and durable medical equipment suppliers  who are the primary customers for several of the company s products  depend heavily on payments from medicare  medicaid and private insurers as a major source of revenues 
in addition  sales of certain of the company s products are affected by the extent of hospital and health care facility construction and renovation at any given time 
the federal government indirectly funds a significant percentage of such construction and renovation costs through medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
in recent years  governmentally imposed limits on reimbursement to hospitals and other health care providers have impacted spending for services  consumables and capital goods 
a material decrease from current reimbursement levels or a material change in the method or basis of reimbursing health care providers is likely to adversely affect future sales of the company s products 
patents  trademarks and proprietary technology the company owns and maintains patents on several products it believes is useful to the business and provides the company with an advantage over its competitors 
during fiscal the company was granted additional us and international patents on the surgex post valve 
the company continues to pursue patents on the xtra backboard  construction alarm and several other products under development 
the company owns and maintains us trademark registrations for chemetron  gomco  oxequip  lif o gen  life support products  timeter  vacutron and schuco  its principal trademarks 
registrations for these trademarks are also owned and maintained in countries where such products are sold and such registrations are considered necessary to preserve the company s proprietary rights therein 
competition the company has different competitors within each of its product lines 
many of the company s principal competitors are larger than allied and the company believes that most of these competitors have greater financial and other resources 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality and service 
the company believes that it is well positioned with respect to product cost  brand recognition  product reliability  and customer service to compete effectively in each of its markets 
employees at june   the company had approximately full time employees 
approximately employees in the company s principal manufacturing facility located in st 
louis  missouri  are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on may  on august   allied entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories abbott pursuant to which allied agreed to cease production of its product baralyme r  and to affect the withdrawal of baralyme r product held by distributors 
the agreement permits allied to pursue the development of a new carbon dioxide absorbent product 
baralyme r  a carbon dioxide absorbent product  has been used safely and effectively in connection with inhalation anesthetics since its introduction in the s 
in recent years  the number of inhalation anesthetics has increased  giving rise to concerns regarding the use of baralyme r in conjunction with these newer inhalation anesthetics if baralyme r has been allowed  contrary to recommended practice  to become desiccated 
the agreement also provides that  for a period of eight years  allied will not manufacture  distribute  promote  market  sell  commercialize or donate any baralyme r product or similar product based upon potassium hydroxide and will not develop or license any new carbon dioxide absorbent product containing potassium hydroxide 
more detailed information concerning this agreement is included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
on september  allied entered into a closedown agreement with the international chemical union representing the employees at the stuyvesant falls  new york facility 
the company had advised the union that the plant will be closed and all bargaining unit employees related to such operation would be permanently laid off  no later than october  the collective bargaining agreement expired and was terminated as of the closing date

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements contained herein are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of various factors  including cyclical and other industry downturns  the effects of federal and state legislation on health care reform  including medicare and medicaid financing  the inability to realize the full benefit of recent capital expenditures or consolidation and rationalization activities  difficulties or delays in the introduction of new products or disruptions in selling  manufacturing and or shipping efforts 
the following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results and financial condition of the company for the three fiscal years ended june  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that may be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following areas are considered to be the company s most significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized for all sales  including sales to agents and distributors  at the time products are shipped and title has transferred  provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract executed  there are not uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales discounts  returns and allowances are included in net sales  and the provision for doubtful accounts is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  it is the company s practice to include revenues generated from freight billed to customers in net sales with corresponding freight expense included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
the sales price is fixed by allied s acceptance of the buyer s firm purchase order 
the sales price is not contingent  or subject to additional discounts 
allied s standard shipment terms are fob shipping point as stated in allied s terms and conditions of sale 
the customer is responsible for obtaining insurance for and bears the risk of loss for product in transit 
additionally  sales to customers do not include the right to return merchandise without the prior consent of allied 
in those cases where returns are accepted  product must be current and restocking fees must be paid by the respective customer 
a provision has been made for estimated sales returns and allowances 
these estimates are based on historical analysis of credit memo data and returns 
allied does not provide installation services for its products 
most products shipped are ready for immediate use by the customer 
the company s in wall medical system components  central station pumps and compressors  and headwalls do require installation by the customer 
these products are typically purchased by a third party contractor who is ultimately responsible for installation services 
accordingly  the customer purchase order or contract does not require customer acceptance of the installation prior to completion of the sale transaction and revenue recognition 
allied s standard payment terms are net days from the date of shipment  and payment is specifically not subject to customer inspection of acceptance  as stated in allied s terms and conditions of sale 
the buyer becomes obligated to pay allied at the time of shipment 
allied requires credit applications from its customers and performs credit reviews to determine the creditworthiness of new customers 
allied requires letters of credit  where warranted  for international transactions 
allied also protects its legal rights under mechanics lien laws when selling to contractors 
allied does offer limited warranties on its products 
the standard warranty period is one year  however  most claims occur within the first six months 
the related liability resulting from these transactions is not significant 
the company s cost of providing warranty service for its products for the year ended june  and june  was  and  respectively 
inventory reserve for obsolete and excess inventory inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory which is determined based on an analysis of inventory items with no usage in the preceding year and for inventory items for which there is greater than two years usage on hand 
this analysis considers those identified inventory items to determine  in management s best estimate  if parts can be used beyond one year  if there are alternate uses or at what values such parts may be disposed for 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company implemented this detailed analysis of inventory in conjunction with its long term product planning process 
this review indicated that the company had experienced a significant decrease in sales during the years prior to fiscal sales decreased from approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease in sales reflected loss of market share  the effect of product lifecycles  and changes in product mix 
in addition  changes were also made in the manufacturing processes of many of the company s products to lower cost as the company made changes to return to profitability 
as a result  a large number of component parts were deemed to be obsolete  resulting in a million charge to increase the company s reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
of the inventory that has been identified as excess and obsolete  most has been disposed 
only a small percentage has been sold 
these sales have no impact on gross margins 
at june  and  inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of million and million  respectively 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 the deferred tax provision is determined using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
see the discussion on page regarding the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal accounts receivable net of allowances accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is determined based on an analysis of past due accounts including accounts placed with collection agencies  and an allowance for returns and credits  which is based on historical analysis of credit memo data and returns

during fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for purchase business combinations and goodwill 
as provided by sfas no 
 the company ceased amortizing goodwill on july  during the first half of fiscal  the company performed the transitional impairment analysis of its goodwill as of the implementation date  following which the company concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill at july  the company completed the required initial annual impairment review of its goodwill at june   which due to declining sales and profitability  resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of  the company conducts a formal impairment test of goodwill on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company below its carrying value 
the annual impairment test did not indicate a further impairment of goodwill at june  or june  allied operates as one reporting unit and prepares its annual goodwill impairment test in that manner 
none of our product lines constitute a business  as that term is defined in eitf most of our products are produced in one facility  and we do not produce separate financial statements for any part of our business 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at june th of each year 
the results of these annual impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projection of future results of the company and there can be no assurance that at the time such future reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
significant factors affecting past and future operating results on august   allied healthcare products  inc allied entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories abbott pursuant to which allied agreed to cease production of its product baralyme r  and to affect the withdrawal of baralyme r product held by distributors 
the agreement permits allied to pursue the development of a new carbon dioxide absorbent product

the agreement also provides that  for a period of eight years  allied will not manufacture  distribute  promote  market  sell  commercialize or donate any baralyme r product or similar product based upon potassium hydroxide and will not develop or license any new carbon dioxide absorbent product containing potassium hydroxide 
in consideration of the foregoing  abbott agreed to pay allied an aggregate of  of which  was paid on september  and the remainder payable in four equal annual installments of  due on july  through july  allied has agreed with abbott that in the event that it receives approval from the us food drug administration for the commercial sale of a new carbon dioxide absorbent product not based upon potassium hydroxide prior to january   that abbott will be relieved of any obligation to fund the  installment due july  the initial payment of  from abbott was received on september  the agreement required abbott to pay allied  for reimbursement of allied s cost incurred in connection with withdrawal of baralyme r from the market  the disposal of such product  and severance payments payable as a result of such withdrawal 
this payment by abbott of  has been included in net sales during the year ended june   in accordance with the fasb s eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company is the primary obligor in the arrangement 
it has sole authority to determine the method of withdrawal of baralyme r and discretion in such matters as employee layoffs  disposal methods  and customer communications regarding the sale of replacement products 
the costs of executing the withdrawal are the sole responsibility of the company 
the remaining  of the payments to be received from abbott  including the  received on september   and  received on june   will be recognized into income  as net sales  over the eight year term of the agreement 
allied has no further obligations under this agreement which would require the company to repay these amounts or otherwise impact this accounting treatment 
during the year ended june   was recognized into income as net sales 
a reconciliation of deferred revenue resulting from the agreement with abbott  with the amounts received under the agreement  and amounts recognized as net sales is as follows twelve months ended june  beginning balance payment received from abbott laboratories  revenue recognized as net sales  less current portion of deferred revenue  as a result of the agreement with abbott  allied has suspended manufacturing operations at its stuyvesant falls  new york facility 
costs associated with the withdrawal and suspension of operations at that location  including severance and benefit payments due union employees  have been and will be recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
on september  allied entered into a closedown agreement with the international chemical union representing the employees at the stuyvesant falls  new york facility 
the company had advised the union that the plant will be closed and all bargaining unit employees related to such operation would be permanently laid off  no later than october  the collective bargaining agreement expired and was terminated as of the closing date 
the company paid severance to those bargaining unit employees on the active payroll as of august  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a charge to cost of sales of  this charge included  for severance payments and fringe benefits for the bargaining unit employees 
the charge included  for the value of baralyme r inventory in stock and the time of the withdrawal  and associated disposal cost 
the charge also included  for replacement of baralyme r inventory which was returned by our customers as a result of the withdrawal 
the company has replaced baralyme r returned by its customers with carbolime r  a carbon dioxide absorption product which continues to be offered for sale by allied 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an adjustment of  to reflect an increase in the estimated product withdrawal cost and disposal cost  as more inventory was returned by customers than originally estimated 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an adjustment of  to reflect an increase in the estimated product withdrawal cost and disposal cost  as disposal costs were more than originally estimated

at june   million was available under the revolving credit facility for additional borrowings 
the credit facility calls for a commitment fee payable quarterly based on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also provides for a commitment guaranty of up to million for letters of credit and requires a per annum fee of on outstanding letters of credit 
at june  and  the company had no letters of credit outstanding 
any outstanding letters of credit decreases the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
under the terms of the amended credit facility  the company is required to be in compliance with certain financial covenants pertaining to stockholders equity  capital expenditures and net income

the optional libor rate may increase from libor plus to libor plus based on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio 
the day libor rate was at june  amortization on the real estate term loan was to continue on a five year schedule with equal monthly payments of  the real estate loan was retired on september  amortization on the capital expenditure term loan was to continue on a five year schedule with equal monthly payments of  the capital expenditure loan was retired on april  the credit facility requires lockbox arrangement  which provide for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
this arrangement  combined with the existence of a material adverse effect mae clause in the credit facility  cause the revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability  per guidance in the fasb s emerging issues task force issue  balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
however  the company does not expect to repay  or be required to repay  within one year  the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current liability 
the mae clause  which is a typical requirement in commercial credit agreements  allows the lender to require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a material adverse effect on the company s operations  business  properties  assets  liabilities  condition or prospects 
the classification of the revolving credit facility as a current liability is a result only of the combination of the two aforementioned factors the lockbox arrangement and the mae clause 
however  the revolving credit facility does not expire or have a maturity date within one year 
additionally  the bank has not notified the company of any indication of a mae at june  at june  the company had no aggregate indebtedness  including capital lease obligations  short term debt and long term debt

the company believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities will be sufficient to finance fixed payments and planned capital expenditures of million in cash flows from operations may be negatively impacted by decreases in sales  market conditions  and adverse changes in working capital 
in the event that economic conditions were to severely worsen for a protracted period of time  we believe that our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will provide sufficient financial flexibility 
the company would have options available to ensure liquidity in addition to increased borrowing 
capital expenditures  which are budgeted at million for the fiscal year ended june   could be postponed 
at june   the company had no bank debt 
based on the company s current level of debt  and performance  debt would bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
the company s agreement with the bank does include provisions for higher interest rates at higher debt levels and different levels of company performance 
inflation has not had a material effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company makes its foreign sales in dollars and  accordingly  sales proceeds are not affected by exchange rate fluctuations  although the effect on its customers does impact the pace of incoming orders 
seasonality and quarterly results in past fiscal years  the company has experienced moderate seasonal increases in net sales during its second and third fiscal quarters october through march which in turn have affected net income 
such seasonal variations were likely attributable to an increase in hospital equipment purchases at the beginning of each calendar year which coincides with many hospitals fiscal years and an increase in the severity of influenza during winter months 
the following table sets forth selected operating results for the eight quarters ended june  the information for each of these quarters is unaudited  but includes all normal recurring adjustments which the company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof 
these operating results  however  are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
further  operating results may fluctuate as a result of the timing of orders  the company s product and customer mix  the introduction of new products by the company and its competitors  and overall trends in the health care industry and the economy 
while these patterns have an impact on the company s quarterly operations  the company is unable to predict the extent of this impact in any particular period

litigation and contingencies the company becomes  from time to time  a party to personal injury litigation arising out of incidents involving the use of its products 
more specifically  there have been a number of lawsuits filed against the company alleging that its aluminum oxygen pressure regulator  marketed under its life support products label  has caused fires that have led to personal injury 
the company believes  based on preliminary findings  that its products did not cause the fires 
the company intends to defend these claims in cooperation with its insurers 
based on the progression of certain cases the company recorded additional charges to operations during fiscal for amounts estimated to be payable by the company under its self insurance retention for legal costs associated with defending these claims 
the company believes that any potential judgments resulting from these claims over its self insured retention will be covered by the company s product liability insurance
