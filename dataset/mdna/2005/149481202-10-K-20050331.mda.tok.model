table of contents catuity s business catuity provides technology based solutions to retailers that are designed to increase the profit they receive from their customers at the point of sale pos 
today  the company sells a hosted  asp based system that enables the processing of member based loyalty programs and which can deliver customized discounts  promotions  rewards and points based programs which are designed to help retailers find  keep and profit from their best customers 
the company also enables gift card solutions 
in late  the company introduced the first version of its new platform  the catuity advanced loyalty system cals 
the system enables robust and highly customizable programs which work on a retailer s payments terminals  electronic cash register and on their internal store networks 
catuity also offers it services to retailers to support their pos systems maintenance and custom development needs for both the deployment of our technology solution and those of third parties which also touch the point of sale 
overview of significant activities was a year of significant change for catuity 
as we have reported throughout  in late february  target corporation decided to discontinue its issuance of smart cards and phase out of its participation in the visa smart rewards platform 
catuity s loyalty software was one of the principal drivers of the smart rewards program that had been  and was being  developed by visa for retailers 
target s decision resulted in visa ceasing operation of the smart rewards program in october in addition  target s decision to discontinue issuing smart cards signaled to the us retail and credit card industries that the much anticipated growth in the use of smart cards in the united states was going to be much longer in arriving than had been expected 
as a result of this significant development  management determined it was necessary to substantially revise its corporate strategy away from the smart card market and began work on a new strategic plan in march prior to the target corporation decision  the company had focused its efforts on licensing its smart card based loyalty software to large retailers in north america 
from its strategic planning efforts  the company determined that its business focus should be on providing a hosted or customized software solution for tier two chain retailers and their partners and on providing services to retailers  merchant service providers  and pos equipment manufacturers for their needs at the point of sale 
as a result  the company s market focus is on tier two retailers with approximately to stores  and in particular  pharmacy chains  home improvement  auto services and other chain retailers looking to improve customer retention  add new customers  and increase each customer s average spend amount 
the company also determined that it needed to become active in the mergers and acquisitions market as a means to provide growth in as short a period of time as possible 
as a result  in the middle of  the company began an active effort to identify companies that would represent an appropriate business fit with catuity s business  provide positive cash flow  and profits from their operations 
on march   the company announced an agreement to purchase all of the outstanding shares of loyalty magic pty 
ltd  an australian company located in melbourne for a million million usd based on the foreign exchange rate in effect on the day before the announcement of the agreement 
this represents a significant step in the company s turnaround plan toward profitability 
loyalty magic was both cashflow positive and profitable in its fiscal year ended june  and expects continued growth in and beyond 
of the a million purchase price  which excludes acquisition related costs  will be issued in new catuity shares with the remainder to be paid in cash 
loyalty magic s management team and its largest shareholder  a b venture fund company pty ltd  will hold the majority of the shares 
catuity will undertake a capital raising  anticipated to be approximately a million or approximately million usd  in order to pay the cash portion of the transaction and to provide increased working capital 
the combined company will have a person team serving existing customers in australia  new zealand  and north america 
the acquisition of loyalty magic and associated capital raise  which is subject to shareholder approval  is expected to close following catuity s annual shareholder meeting in late may in september  the board hired alfred h 
john racine iii  to become its president and ceo 
mr 
racine had served as the consultant to catuity in developing the company s revised business strategy 
mr 
racine was the founder and managing principal of altamont partners  which specializes in the payments industry  and was retained in march to advise the company on its business strategy and merger acquisition alternatives 
during  additional management changes were made in order to align the experience and skills of key personnel in the company with those needed to succeed in its new market focus 
in addition  in september the board of directors asked mr 
clifford chapman to join the board 
mr 
chapman is very experienced in turnaround company situations and also brings substantial merger acquisition experience to the board

table of contents in may of  the minimum bid price for catuity shares on nasdaq had remained below for consecutive days  resulting in the company being out of compliance with one of nasdaq s continuous listing requirements 
in order to regain compliance  on november   the company held a special shareholders meeting in sydney australia for the purpose of seeking shareholder support for a reverse stock split  also known as a share consolidation 
the proposal overwhelmingly passed  authorizing the board to effect a reverse split 
immediately after the special shareholders meeting  the board of directors unanimously authorized a for reverse split to be effective on november   the earliest date that trading could begin in the post reverse shares 
as a result of the reverse stock split  on december   the company regained compliance with all of nasdaq s continued listing requirements 
the balance sheet  earnings per share  and other appropriate data in this annual report on form k have been restated to reflect the reverse stock split 
the company s total shareholders equity at december   was below nasdaq s minimum continued listing requirement of m 
while the company will follow nasdaq s required steps to regain compliance  the issuance of new shares related to the pending acquisition of loyalty magic pty 
ltd 
will bring the company into compliance with nasdaq s continuous listing requirements 
throughout  catuity developed its new catuity advanced loyalty system or cals 
most significantly  the architecture of the platform is database and operating system agnostic thereby reducing integration risks and hidden costs that can deter a client from making a buying decision 
the system is also agnostic at the point of sale 
cals will work with any customer identifier selected by the client 
it works with leading and emerging pos media  including magnetic stripe  bar code  account number  biometric access device  rfid signal and even a smart card 
catuity announced its initial release of cals in the third quarter of and will continue to make enhancements to the system to seek competitive advantage in the market 
the system is maintained on an internal hosting system in both sydney  australia and near the company s headquarters in detroit  michigan 
in the second quarter of  the company expects to establish its first commercial host under an application service provider asp model which is commonly used in north america 
catuity s revenue declined to  from million in due to the cessation of new development efforts and phasing out of the visa smart rewards platform 
expenses were reduced by approximately million  despite incurring one time severance costs and significant research and development cost on cals 
most importantly  as the company entered  it had significantly reduced its average monthly expenses 
while the company has undergone significant downsizing  it also has undertaken efforts to retain its key people that have the expertise needed to sell to and service its existing customers and its targeted customers 
management believes the company is in a position to significantly grow revenue without having to add significant cost

the company intends to raise equity capital in  anticipated to be approximately a million or approximately million usd  in order to fund the cash portion of the loyalty magic pty ltd 
acquisition and to provide increased working capital 
in the event that the acquisition does not occur  catuity s board of directors will initiate a shareholder rights offering with the objective of raising  usd 
the completion of the acquisition is dependent on factors including  but not limited to  the approval of shareholders and the successful completion of a capital raise 
in either instance  the five individual members of the board of directors has committed at least  usd toward the capital raise 
the company has also significantly reduced operating expenses and believes that the investment made in the new cals platform in  in combination with the board s new market strategy  will begin to reflect favorably on the cash position of the company 
the company s board of directors has adopted a strategy which n drove the release of the new cals system to meet the changing technology requirements of the us and canadian markets 
table of contents n refocused the sales efforts on tier two chain retailers  especially pharmacies  home improvement stores and auto services  where the capabilities of cals have a demonstrable return on investment n developed a sales channel through merchant services  acquirers and processors who serve the more than two million smaller  individual merchants which are too small to be serviced directly through catuity s sales model 
n shifted the company s technology team from pure research and development to being largely focused on client deployments and services around a hosted solution  rather than the traditional installed software business where the company had found its initial success in the us n leverages the company s experience with the aim of offering a managed gift card solution in australia by the second half of to meet the growing interest by retailers of all sizes 
n selectively explore projects and opportunities in which the company leverages its technology and operational understanding of loyalty and gift card programs with partners who offer other strengths

as of december   the company had net operating tax loss carry forwards of  expiring in various amounts from through in the united states and  of net operating tax loss carry forwards in australia

critical accounting policies and assumptions the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing circumstances 
as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
revenue recognition we have three distinct revenue streams software development revenue  service revenue  and license revenue 
software development revenue includes integration  customization and development related to our software application and the customer s related hardware and software 
software development revenue is generally billed on a fixed price basis 
the company recognizes revenue on fixed price contracts on the proportional performance method in accordance with sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab  revenue recognition  based on actual hours incurred as a proportion of estimated total hours of the respective project 
management s estimate of total project hours is based on actual hours incurred to date combined with current hours estimated to complete remaining project tasks 
it is reasonable that the estimated number of total hours may change  however this does not impact total project revenue recognized as the sales price is typically fixed 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated total revenues and direct costs are recognized in the period in which they become known 
revenue in excess of billings is recognized as unbilled receivables and is included in work in process in the consolidated balance sheet 
billings in excess of revenue are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met 
service revenue includes training  consulting  installation support  post installation support and maintenance fees 
training  consulting  installation support and post installation support are generally billed on a time and material basis and revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
service revenue in consisted of post installation customer support  which was based on a contracted number of monthly support hours  and maintenance 
license revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which provides for recognition of revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery and acceptance of the software has occurred  no essential undelivered elements remain on the company s part that are essential to the functionality of the delivered software  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection has either occurred or is probable 
billings in excess of revenue are recorded as deferred 
table of contents revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue recognized from multiple element arrangements is allocated to undelivered elements of the arrangement  such as maintenance  based on the relative fair value of each element 
the company s determination of fair value of each element in multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management for an element not yet sold separately 
the company has established vsoe for maintenance services 
all of the license revenue recognized in was related to a license agreement in which revenue was recognized monthly  based on a minimum number of transactions 
the company generally does not provide for a right of return in its license contracts 
deferred tax assets the company records a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
based on historical operating losses  it is difficult to determine the amount or timing of future earnings  therefore  there is currently no tax benefit recorded by the company due to the full valuation allowance 
accounting for equity instruments the company accounts for stock based awards issued to employees under the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and has adopted the disclosure only alternative of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

based on the company s election to become a small business issuer beginning in fiscal  we will adopt sfas r beginning with the st quarter of  as required 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based awards using a fair value based method 
as a result  because sfas r requires the expensing of stock options  it will have an adverse effect on our reported financial results 
however  we have not yet assessed the level of impact to be able to quantify the adverse effect 
the shareholder loan outstanding  which relates to loans issued to a director in and to purchase stock  is re valued at each respective balance sheet date if the company s period ending fair market price per share is below the price per share at which the loan was made 
the offsetting entry is made to additional paid in capital 
if the company s ending fair market price per share is above the price per share at which the loan was made  we record variable stock compensation expense  based on the difference in price per share  on a cumulative basis 
legal proceedings catuity was not a party to any legal proceedings during or as of the date of filing of this form k 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we will adopt sfas r effective as of the first quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
as a result  because sfas r requires the expensing of stock options  it will have an adverse effect on our reported financial results 
however  we have not yet assessed the level of impact to be able to quantify the adverse effect 
factors affecting our operating results  our business and our share price in addition to the other information contained in this form k  you should carefully read and consider the following risks and uncertainties described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing catuity 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us also may impair our business 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 

table of contents risks related to our business we have a history of losses and anticipate future losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  to date  we have not achieved profitability 
while management believes our strategies will be successful  there can be no assurance that our business strategies will be successful or that significant revenues or profitability will be achieved 
if we do achieve profitability  we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis 
we may be adversely affected if we fail to retain key personnel and attract new qualified personnel 
our operations will depend on our ability to attract new key personnel and retain existing key personnel 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
if we are unable to hire or retain key employees  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be harmed 
we will be adversely affected if our cals product does not achieve market acceptance 
we will be adversely affected if our new generation of software  the catuity advanced loyalty systems cals  does not achieve market acceptance 
cals had not been commercially deployed  and there can be no assurance that the product will perform all the desired functions  or offer sufficient price performance benefits or meet the technical or other requirements of customers 
despite testing of our product prior to its commercial release  there can be no assurance that all performance errors or deficiencies have been discovered and remedied  that additional errors or deficiencies will not occur  or if they occur  that we will be able to correct such errors and deficiencies 
failure to obtain certifications in a timely manner to deploy our technology on behalf of a client  catuity must install a specialized application at the point of sale for a client 
because of the diverse range of payment terminals  readers  electronic cash registers and proprietary checkout systems used by merchants and retailers  catuity must certify its application to meet the standards of the independent manufacturers of each model and series of terminals 
equally important  in many cases  catuity s pos application must be certified by the payments processor who manages the transactional side of the business for merchants and retailers 
catuity has been successful in previous efforts with market leaders including verifone  hypercom and schlumberger 
however  we can make no assurance that the company will be able to obtain future certifications in a timely manner 
if we fail to obtain the necessary certifications  it could have a material adverse impact us  including the loss of existing business  extended delays in closing new business and or the impairment of future revenues 
sales activities with prospective customers may not generate revenue for the company the success of our operations will be highly dependent on our ability to generate revenue from current and future prospective customers 
while management believes that the company will be successful in generating revenue from prospective customers there can be no assurance of the level of revenue that will be generated 
risks related to our industry competition in the application software industry could harm our business 
the application software industry is highly competitive  rapidly developing and subject to constant innovation and change 
numerous other companies operate incentive marketing programs using both electronic and paper based systems  both for retail stores and the internet 
many of these companies have significantly longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
our competitors may respond more quickly than we can to changing technologies and customer requirements 
for example  these competitors may conduct more extensive marketing campaigns to capture market share  provide more attractive incentive and pricing packages to customers  negotiate more favorable contracts with existing and potential employees and strategic partners  establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  including large internet participants  to increase the ability of their products and services to address the needs of prospective customers  bundle their products with other software or hardware  including operating systems and browsers  in a manner that may discourage users from purchasing products offered by us  
table of contents establish cooperative relationships with our current or potential competitors  thereby limiting our ability to sell our products through particular reseller channels  or more quickly develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services 
our ability  and the ability of our resellers  to compete effectively in the market for application software for incentive and loyalty marketing programs will depend upon a variety of factors  including our ability to provide high quality products and services at prices generally competitive with  or lower than  those charged by our competitors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 
moreover  there can be no assurance that certain of our competitors will not be better situated to negotiate contracts with retailers and resellers that are more favorable than contracts we negotiate 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the competition from existing or new competitors or a decrease in the rates charged for products and services by our competitors will not materially and adversely affect us 
new technologies could render our product obsolete 
the application software business is characterized by rapid technological change  new product introduction and evolving industry standards 
advances in applications software or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing applications software could render our product obsolete and unmarketable 
our success will depend  in significant part  on our ability to make timely and cost effective enhancements and additions to our technology and to introduce new products and services that meet customer demands 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new products  services and enhancements 
delay in the introduction of new products  enhancements or services  the inability to develop such new products  enhancements or services or their failure to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may face risks related to the storage or provision of inaccurate or confidential information 
it is possible that information provided through the use of our product or information that is copied and stored by customers that have deployed our product may contain errors 
in such event  third parties could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on such information 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability or legal defense expenses that is not covered by insurance or that is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  from time to time  persons may unlawfully obtain information concerning a customer s or retailer s program by unlawfully utilizing access numbers  passwords and personal identification numbers 
no assurance can be given that future losses due to claims by third parties for unauthorized use will not be material 
we maintain no reserves for such risks 
there can be no assurance that our risk management practices will be sufficient to protect us from unauthorized thefts of information that could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may be subject to product liability claims for use or misuse of our product 
retailers rely  and will continue to rely  on our product in connection with providing promotions that have a direct financial impact on their businesses and their customers 
use or misuse of our product  whether due to accident  employee fraud  or otherwise  may result in unintended or undesirable consequences that could result in financial or other damages to our customers and to our customers customers 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may face risks related to the use of electronic payment cards 
portions of our software may be integrated with or co reside with a range of third party payment and other software 
for example  our product may be added to existing or new electronic payment cards  either by the addition of software to a chip or by using the payment card number as an identifier with our product 
alternatively  a portion of the software comprising our product may be added to existing or new payment devices  so that such software co resides with payment programs 
on the internet and in other environments  a portion of our software may be integrated with a third party supplied e commerce program 
there can be no assurances that such integration or co residence will not adversely affect the payment system  potentially giving rise to a claim that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if our customers experience problems with a payment system  it may be difficult to determine if those problems originate from our product or other products with which ours co reside 
such difficulty may delay resolution of any such problem and prove costly to us 

table of contents we may be affected by potential privacy regulation 
the federal trade commission is considering the adoption of regulations regarding the collection and use of personal information obtained from individuals when accessing internet sites 
these regulations could restrict our ability to provide demographic data to retailers 
at the international level  the european union has adopted a directive that will impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data 
these developments could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may face increased governmental regulation and legal uncertainties 
catuity will enable or manage confidential customer information on behalf of our clients 
recent high profile cases of customer information being compromised have heightened concerns among our prospects  investors and state and federal legislators about the need to ensure that the information of individuals be protected 
since sept 
  regulation of public and non public information has increased significantly 
even though catuity s customers generally seek written permission from loyalty program participants to collect and use information on their shopping behavior  the company cannot ensure that its customers will comply with appropriate regulations or industry best practices 
the gift card industry also continues to face regulatory  legislative and judicial scrutiny 
at present  attorney generals in at least states in the us have initiated lawsuits against high profile gift card providers targeting their disclosure and management practices 
proposed state and federal legislation  such as the fair gift card act  is specifically directed at escheatment  breakage and liability management practices of card issuers 
broadly  this concerns both the level of required disclosure to consumers about fees and charges associated with their accounts 
to manage these risks  catuity takes appropriate and customary steps in our client agreements and through our operational procedures 
catuity has no control over the pricing  disclosure and management strategies of its clients and cannot ensure that our clients will comply with appropriate regulations or industry best practices 
to the extent that catuity s customers face regulatory  legislative or judicial action  the company could be made a party to those actions 
these could materially and adversely affect us 
we may face intellectual property challenges 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our proprietary technology and trademarks  which we attempt to protect through a combination of patent  copyrights  trade secret and trademark laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
however  any steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate  time consuming and expensive  and there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
in addition  we may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties  including third party rights in patents that have not yet been issued 
we expect that third party infringement claims involving internet technologies and software products will increase 
any claims regarding the rights of third parties  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
we have agreed  and may agree in the future  to indemnify certain of our customers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
we could incur substantial costs in defending our sellers and our customers against infringement claims 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have applied for patents in relation to the method of operation of incentive marketing programs using electronic means 
we cannot assure you that our patent applications will be approved 
moreover  even if approved  they may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties 
in recent times a number of patents have been granted in this area 
although we are not aware of any issued patent that our product would infringe  legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of intellectual property rights in internet related industries and use of electronic data for granting of benefits and rewards are uncertain and still evolving  and the future viability or value of any of our intellectual property rights is uncertain 
corporate and market risks our trading volume may be low and our share price may be volatile 
we are currently listed on two exchanges  the asx  in australia  and the nasdaq small cap market  in the united states 
there can be no assurance that an adequate volume of trading in our shares will be achieved and maintained  on nasdaq or the asx  in order to provide liquidity for our investors 
trading in catuity shares on nasdaq and the asx averaged  shares per day in the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control 
table of contents variations in actual or anticipated quarterly or annual operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of loyalty software service companies  announcements by us of significant contracts  reseller arrangements  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of common stock or termination of stock transfer restrictions  and fluctuations in stock market price and volume  which are particularly common among securities of small technology companies 
the market prices and volumes of the common stock of many publicly held technology based companies have in the past been  and can in the future be expected to be  especially volatile  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall for reasons not necessarily related to our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the market price of our stock also might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  following a period of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted against such a company 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and our resources 
we may be subject to arbitrage risks 
investors may seek to profit by exploiting the difference  if any  in the price of our stock on the asx and nasdaq 
such arbitraging activities could cause our stock price in the market with the higher value to decrease to the price set by the market with the lower value 
complying with nasdaq s continued listing requirements we have experienced  and continue to experience  difficulty maintaining all of nasdaq s continued listing requirements  due to the small size of our company 
the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market are as follows either a stockholders equity of  b net income in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three years of  or c market capitalization of  a public float of  shares  a market value of public float of  a minimum bid price of per share  at least two market makers  at least round lot stockholders  and compliance with nasdaq corporate governance rules 
certain delaware anti takeover provisions may produce results disfavored by our shareholders 
provisions of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors  even if our stockholders favored such a change 
we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder  unless prior to such date  the board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder  upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder  the interested stockholder owned at least of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced  and on or subsequent to such date  the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders  and not by written consent  by the affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder 
section defines business combination to include any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder  any sale  transfer  pledge or other disposition of or more of our assets involving the interested stockholder  
table of contents subject to certain exceptions  any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by us of any of our stock to the interested stockholder  any transaction involving us that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series beneficially owned by the interested stockholder  and the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans  advances  guarantees  pledges or other financial benefits provided by us or through the corporation 
in general  section defines an interested stockholder as an entity or person beneficially owning or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting rules and regulations  such as expensing of stock options  could result in unfavorable accounting charges 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
in particular  the fasb recently enacted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which we will adopt effective the first quarter of as a result  because sfas r requires the expensing of stock options  it will have an adverse effect on our reported financial results 
however  we have not yet assessed the level of impact to be able to quantify the adverse effect 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our expenses  assets and liabilities denominated in the australian dollar 
to date  we have not utilized any foreign currency hedging or other derivative instruments to reduce exchange rate risk 
we do not expect to employ these or other strategies to hedge the risk in the foreseeable future 
as of december   and the company s net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency risk are  and  the potential decrease in net assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately  and  net current assets subject to foreign currency risk are larger as of december  compared to due to larger cash balances maintained in australia 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on deposits of cash  which are affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states and australia 
since we generally invest in very short term interest bearing deposits  we do not believe we are subject to any material market risk exposure
