the growth in zebra s business was well balanced across geographies  products  and channels 
we experienced notable sales growth in mobile printers  as the mainstream adoption of wireless technology has expanded the uses of mobile printing in applications across an increasing number of vertical markets 
in addition  we believe that channel programs implemented in north america supported higher sales in the region with strengthened and expanded channel partner relationships 
more zebra sales representatives in international territories helped increase the number of channel relationships in overseas regions and support sales growth 
new printer products defined as printers released within months prior to the end of the applicable fiscal period as a percent of total printer product sales were as follows december  three months ended year ended our international sales are denominated in multiple currencies  primarily the dollar  pound and euro 
this directly causes our reported sales to be subject to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates 
when significant currency rate fluctuations occur  we review our product pricing and make appropriate changes to maintain our competitive position 
we estimate that favorable foreign exchange movements of the euro and the pound versus the dollar had a net positive effect of  on sales during the fourth quarter and  for the full year 
we currently hedge a portion of anticipated euro denominated sales to partially protect zebra against exchange rate movements 
for the fourth quarter  this program resulted in a loss of  and a full year loss of  see note to the financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this hedging program 
printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below three months ended december  percent year ended december  percent change change total printers shipped average selling price of printers shipped for all of  unit volumes increased in nearly all product lines and all regions  with notable strength in mobile printers 
for the full year  a favorable product mix toward higher priced products and a richer feature set within product segments  on balance  supported a increase in the average selling price of printers shipped

selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses are summarized below in thousands  except percentages december  percent percent of percent of change total sales total sales three months ended year ended we continue to invest heavily in demand generating activities to build brand equity in our core product lines as well as in the emerging area of radio frequency identification rfid 
during the fourth quarter of  selling and marketing expenses increased due to higher payroll costs of  from increased staffing as well as higher advertising and market development funding of  for the full year  the payroll costs increased  and advertising and market development funding increased  in addition to increases in the items mentioned above  we increased outside commission  consulting and legal expenses 
much of the additional headcount related to placing more zebra representatives in high growth international regions as part of our geographic expansion activities 
we also increased staff for better coverage of strategic accounts

we are committed to a long term strategy of significant investment in product development 
for the fourth quarter of  research and development expenses increased because of an increase in payroll costs of  for the full year  payroll costs increased  project expenses and consulting expenses also increased as a result of additional expenditures for new products including radio frequency identification rfid 
we expect to invest a larger portion of our research and development expenditures in the future on the development of rfid printer encoders 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are summarized in the table below in thousands  except percentages december  percent percent of percent of change total sales total sales three months ended year ended for the fourth quarter of  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of increased legal expenses 
for the full year of  general and administrative expenses include  of increased legal expenses related to litigation with paxar  increased intellectual property work  and international expansion activity 
in addition to legal expenses in  we saw an increase in payroll costs and information system expenses 
exit costs since the fourth quarter of  we announced several facility consolidation and closure activities 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced plans to close our engineering site in varades  france 
during january  we announced plans to consolidate our warwick  rhode island  printer manufacturing and repair service business into our camarillo  california and vernon hills  illinois locations 
during december  we announced plans to close and consolidate our wakefield  rhode island facility into our other north american facilities  primarily into the warwick  rhode island facility 
these plans are accounted for under sfas no

for the full year of  sales translated into dollars increased by  or percentage points compared to translating the same sales using exchange rates that prevailed in to remain competitive in markets experiencing currency strength against the dollar  we adjusted our pricing resulting in a  reduction in sales 
the net sales increase related to exchange rate fluctuations and offsetting pricing adjustments was  for printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below year ended december  percent change total printers shipped average selling price of printers shipped for  the increase in printer volume was due to high sales of desktop and mobile printers as a result of more companies adopting technology for wireless networks 
average unit selling price increases were related to increases in the average unit selling prices of mid range desktop printers  portable printers and print engines and is offset by higher volumes of the lower priced mobile printers 
gross profit gross profit information is summarized below in thousands except percentages percent of for the year ended gross profit total sales december  december  percent change gross profit increased due to higher capacity utilization related to the higher sales volume  representing  of the total gross profit increase for foreign exchange rate movements and related pricing adjustments  which we estimate increased gross profit by  for due to foreign exchange movements  net of related pricing adjustments 
cost reductions  which contributed  to the margin improvement during selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses are summarized below in thousands  except percentages for the year ended selling and marketing expenses percent of total sales december  december  percent change the increase in selling and marketing expenses for resulted from our investments in demand generating activities with higher advertising  publications and market research  travel  demonstration units and market development fund expenses 
research and development costs research and development costs are summarized below in thousands  except percentages for the year ended research and development costs percent of total sales december  december  percent change for  research and development expenses increased primarily due to increases in project expenses  which were higher because of reductions related to third party funded engineering costs that had occurred in but did not reoccur in in addition  payroll and benefits were up  over  but consulting expenses were down  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are summarized below in thousands  except percentages for the year ended general and administrative expenses percent of total sales december  december  percent change for  general and administrative expenses include  of increased legal expenses related to litigation with paxar  increased intellectual property work  international activity  and general contract review 
in addition to legal expenses in  we saw an increase in director and officer liability insurance and administrative personnel costs 
a portion of these costs resulted from new compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
offsetting these increases was a decline in consulting expenses 
costs related to terminated acquisitions and merger costs during  we terminated the acquisition agreement and tender offer in which zebra would acquire all outstanding shares of common stock including associated rights to purchase preferred stock of fargo electronics  inc for per share in cash 
during the time that the tender offer was active  we incurred legal  accounting and other expenses related to the proposed acquisition that would have been treated as part of the purchase price had the tender offer been completed 
we expensed  of these costs at the cancellation of the tender offer 
exit costs during the fourth quarter of  we announced a plan to close our engineering site in varades  france 
this plan is being accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
included in operating expenses for are exit costs  consisting of primarily severance  in the amount of  operating income operating income is summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages percent of for the year ended operating income total sales december  december  percent change the increase in operating income is attributable to the following factors accelerated sales growth compared to  improved gross margins resulting from increased overhead utilization  favorable changes in foreign exchange rates for zebra s non dollar denominated business  and cost controls that held operating expense growth slightly below the rate of sales growth

income taxes the effective income tax rate for was versus in the rate for is less than the zebra had previously recorded because of the following nonrecurring tax items during the year during the fourth quarter of  we settled our long standing dispute with the illinois department of revenue and recorded a decrease to income tax expense for  since our reserves for this tax dispute exceeded the amount of the settlement 
during the third quarter of  we eliminated a reserve related to research and experimentation tax credits that were claimed and recorded a reduction to income tax expense of  excluding these two tax adjustments  our effective tax rate would have been for net income zebra s net income is summarized below in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  net income diluted earnings per share critical accounting policies and estimates management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra technologies corporation under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable  based upon the information available 
our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements 
the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra s reported financial results 
revenue recognition zebra recognizes sales from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title  which are generally the same 
other items that affect our revenue recognition include customer returns customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
historically  our product returns have not been significant 
however  if a significant issue should arise  it could have a material impact on our financial statements 
volume rebates some of our customers are offered incentive rebates based on the volume of product they purchase from us over a quarter or year 
these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
each quarter  we estimate the amount of outstanding volume rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history 
historically  actual volume rebates have been in line with our estimates 
price protection some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve  which is charged against revenue 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal 
we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 
software revenue we sell three types of software and record revenue as follows our printers contain embedded firmware  which is part of the hardware purchase 
we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it 
we sell a limited amount of prepackaged  or off the shelf  software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers 
there is no customization required to use this software  and we have no post shipment obligations on the software 
revenue is recognized at the time this prepackaged software is shipped 
we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project 
we bill custom software development services separate from the related hardware 
revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer 
shipping and handling we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items 
the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships 
any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 
from time to time  zebra will enter into sales transactions that include more than one product type 
this bundle of products might include printers  current or future supplies  and services 
when this type of transaction occurs  we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products 
the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the earning process for that product is complete 
investments and marketable securities investments and marketable securities at december   consisted of us government securities  state and municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and partnership interests 
we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
trading and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  and an active collection effort by regional credit functions  reporting directly to the corporate financial officers 
we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
over the last three years  accounts receivable reserves varied from to of total accounts receivable 
accounts receivable reserves as of december   were  or of the balance due 
we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december  while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first in  first out fifo method  or the current estimated market value 
we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for zebra s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  however  this would be offset by improved overhead utilization resulting from the additional demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in excess inventory quantities on hand 
our forecasted product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated 
if inventories were determined to be overvalued  we would recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand  however  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventories and reported operating results 
over the last three years  our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from to of gross inventory 
as of december   reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were  or of gross inventory 
we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our last assessment during june we evaluate the impairment of other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in zebra s stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred  we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to  as of december  contingencies we record estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes 
quarterly  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
on april   paxar americas  inc paxar americas filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio against zebra and certain of its subsidiaries 
paxar americas complaint alleges that certain of zebra s printer products infringe one or more of eight identified paxar americas patents  although not each product is accused of infringing each patent 
zebra has filed an answer to paxar americas complaint  denying paxar americas allegations of infringement and asserting several affirmative defenses  including the invalidity of paxar americas asserted patent claims 
paxar has sought to amend its original complaint to add two additional patents to the lawsuit and to expand the scope of accused products 
zebra has opposed paxar s motions in this regard and the court has the issue under advisement 
on november   zebra s subsidiary  zih corp 
zih  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against paxar corporation  alleging that paxar corporation printers infringe zih s us patent nos 
 and  paxar corporation answered zih s complaint  denying infringement and seeking a declaratory judgment that zih s patents in suit are not infringed and are invalid and or unenforceable 
paxar corporation filed a motion to transfer zih s massachusetts suit to ohio federal court  and the court denied paxar s motion 
on november   paxar americas filed a complaint against zih in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio  seeking a declaratory judgment that the patents asserted by zih in its massachusetts complaint are not infringed and are invalid and unenforceable 
on december   paxar americas amended its complaint to add zebra technologies corporation as a defendant 
in view of the massachusetts district court s denial of paxar corporation s motion to transfer to ohio zih s corresponding patent infringement suit against paxar corporation  the parties to paxar america s ohio declaratory judgment action have agreed to transfer this case to massachusetts 
the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain  particularly in cases such as these where sophisticated factual issues must be assessed and complex technical issues must be decided 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict the outcome of these lawsuits 
in the event we are unsuccessful in our defense of paxar americas infringement claims  we could be liable for economic and other damages  which could be material  and we may be forced to incur ongoing licensing expenses or to change how we design  manufacture and market our products 
the patents that zih has asserted against paxar corporation could be found invalid 
we have and will continue to incur substantial fees to prosecute and defend these lawsuits 
we are unable at this time to estimate the range of the potential liability that would result from an unsuccessful defense  and consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  no liability has been recorded in zebra s consolidated financial statements as of december  stock based compensation as of december   zebra had three stock based compensation plans available for future grants 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant

liquidity and capital resources zebra continued to generate cash well in excess of its operating requirements 
as a result  zebra s cash and investment balances have continually grown over time 
as of december   zebra had  in cash  cash equivalents  investments and marketable securities  compared with  at december  factors affecting cash and investment balances during include note that changes discussed below include the impact of foreign currency operations provided a net cash increase of  primarily from net income 
accounts receivable increased  because of higher sales 
inventories increased  compared to the same period a year ago  inventory turns decreased to from other assets increased  primarily due to the purchase of life insurance policies on key executives with guaranteed returns  which due to the nature of these investments are classified as long term 
accounts payable increased by  in relation to the increase in inventory 
accrued expenses increased  taxes payable increased  due to increased profits 
purchases of property and equipment totaled  net purchases of investments and marketable securities totaled  stock option exercises and purchases under the stock purchase plan contributed  zebra s contractual obligations as of december  were payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements  primarily raw materials 
management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements 
it is our intention to actively pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however  the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  we will evaluate the impact of eitf once final guidance is issued 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for added disclosures 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that these costs may be so abnormal that they would require treatment as current period charges 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
this statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement describes our current process  therefore  it will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through share based payment transactions 
it requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the provisions of this statement become effective for zebra during the third quarter of we expect the impact on zebra s consolidated financial statements to be consistent with the fair value disclosures included in our critical accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fsp fas  application of fasb no 
 accounting foriincome taxe  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp fas no 
clarifies sfas no 
s guidance that applies to the new tax deduction for qualified domestic production activities 
fsp no 
became effective upon issuance and we believe that this pronouncement will have an insignificant impact on our effective tax rate in in december  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp fas provides implementation guidance related to the repatriation provision of the american jobs creation act of we have completed our assessment of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that might be repatriated 
at this time we do not expect to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as dividends to take advantage of this tax credit 
risk factors investors should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below  as well as other disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra s business  financial condition  operating results  and growth prospects 
zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes  including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption 
acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results 
proposed acquisitions that are not consummated may result in the write off of certain acquisition costs 
zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses  technologies  services or products 
the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention  which could otherwise be available for ongoing development of the business 
the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
moreover  zebra may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses 
to the extent that a proposed acquisition is not consummated  zebra may be required to write off certain costs associated with the acquisition  which could be significant 
zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 
to be successful  zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 
zebra s industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards frequent new product and service introductions evolving distribution channels changing customer demands future success will depend on zebra s ability to adapt in this rapidly evolving environment 
zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes  and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 
zebra competes in a highly competitive market  which is likely to become more competitive 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements 
zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems 
principal competitors have substantial marketing  financial  development and personnel resources 
to remain competitive  zebra believes it must continue to provide technologically advanced systems that satisfy the user demands  superior customer service  high levels of quality and reliability  and dependable and efficient distribution networks 
zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions  lower gross profit margins and loss of market share  and could require increased spending on research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products 
any of these factors could reduce zebra s earnings 
zebra may incur liabilities as a result of zebra installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects 
zebra generally has insurance for such risks and also seeks to limit such risk though product design  manufacturing quality control processes  product testing and contractual limitations 
however  due to the large and growing size of zebra s installed printer base  a design or manufacturing defect attributable to this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra s financial results 
the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra s reputation  and its competitive position may be materially damaged 
zebra s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages 
copyrights  patents  trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra s products or  without authorization  to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 
infringement on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage  and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly 
third parties may claim that zebra violated their intellectual property rights 
to the extent of a violation of a third party s patent or other intellectual property right  zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned  and may be required to pay damages  to obtain a license  if available  or to use a non infringing method  if possible  to accomplish its objectives 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
if such claims are successful  they could result in costly judgments or settlements 
zebra sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers 
these circumstances create a number of risks 
zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states 
shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales 
risks associated with sales and purchases outside the united states include fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales  or increase costs of purchasing  in foreign countries 
foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs  quotas  taxes  trade barriers or capital flow restrictions 
political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products  or put our foreign assets at risk 
restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets 
potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries  such as china  may limit recourse against infringing products or cause zebra to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 
staffing and managing international operations may be unusually difficult 
zebra may not be able to control international distributors working on its behalf 
economic factors  which are outside zebra s control  could lead to deterioration in the quality of zebra s accounts receivables 
zebra sells its products to customers in the united states and several other countries around the world 
sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms  which are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in a given country 
a deterioration of economic or political conditions in a country could impair zebra s ability to collect on receivables in the affected country 
zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel 
future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the service of any executive officer or other key employees could adversely affect business 
zebra has no long term employment agreements with key personnel and maintains minimal key man life insurance policies on its key employees 
the ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra s long term success 
competition for personnel in zebra s industry is intense  and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra s stock price  operations  and profitability 
the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september  caused major instability in the us and other financial markets
