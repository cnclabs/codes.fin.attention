overview business polymedica corporation was organized in today  through our primary segment  liberty diabetes  we are a leading provider of direct to consumer diabetes testing supplies  primarily to seniors 
we provide a simple and reliable way for our patients to obtain their supplies and medications 
we communicate directly with our patients and their physicians regarding patients prescriptions and testing regimen on a regular basis and we bill medicare and third party insurers on behalf of our patients 
through our liberty respiratory segment  we provide direct to consumer respiratory medications  primarily to seniors 
through our pharmaceuticals segment  we sell prescription medications directly to existing liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory patients and their spouses  and we also manufacture and sell prescription and over the counter urology products to distributors and retailers 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
polymedica s significant accounting policies are presented within note a to our consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
while all of our accounting policies impact the consolidated financial statements  certain policies are viewed to be critical 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies on revenue recognition and accounts receivable  advertising  goodwill and other intangible assets  and amounts reserved for overpayments by medicare and others 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue related to product sales to patients who have placed orders upon shipment of such orders  provided that risk of loss has passed to the patient and we have received and verified any written documentation required to bill medicare  other third party payers  and patients 
we record revenue at 
table of contents the amounts expected to be collected from medicare  other third party payers  and directly from patients 
our billing system generates contractual adjustments based on government and third party fee schedules for each product shipment  as a result  estimates of contractual adjustments are not required 
revenue recognition is delayed for product shipments for which we have not yet received the required written documentation until the period in which the documentation is collected and verified 
we analyze various factors in determining revenue recognition  including a review of specific transactions  current medicare regulations and reimbursement rates  historical experience  and the credit worthiness of patients 
revenue related to medicare reimbursement is calculated based on government determined reimbursement prices for medicare covered items 
the reimbursements that medicare pays are subject to review by appropriate government regulators 
medicare reimburses at of the government determined prices for reimbursable supplies  and we bill the remaining balance to either third party payers or directly to patients 
the collectibility of our accounts receivable varies based on payer mix  general economic conditions and other factors 
a provision for doubtful accounts is made for accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible and is adjusted periodically based primarily upon our evaluation of historical collection and write off experience  current industry conditions  industry reimbursement trends  credit policy  and on our analysis of accounts receivable by aging category 
the evaluation is performed at the end of each reporting period for each operating unit with an overall assessment at the consolidated level 
during the fiscal years ended march   and we provided for allowances for doubtful accounts at a rate of approximately  and of net revenues  respectively 
the reduction in the provision is primarily the result of improved collection efforts  which include the re submission of statements to parties with outstanding balances  issuance of written correspondence requesting payment and verbal communication attempts initiated by personnel within our internal collections department 
the improvement in our collection efforts is further evidenced by the reduction in days sales outstanding of accounts receivable balances from days as of march  to days as of march  for the fiscal year ended march   a hypothetical change of in the allowance for doubtful accounts provision as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately million 
the following tables detail our gross accounts receivable balances by aging category from the billing date for each payer source for the fiscal years ended march  and aging of accounts receivable as of march  days total accounts payers outstanding outstanding outstanding outstanding receivable government medicare commercial parties and medicaid patients self pay total gross accounts receivable less accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable  net aging of accounts receivable as of march  days total accounts payers outstanding outstanding outstanding outstanding receivable government medicare commercial parties and medicaid patients self pay total gross accounts receivable less accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable  net 
table of contents in addition  sales allowances are recorded for estimated product returns as well as estimated claim denials as a reduction of gross revenue 
we analyze sales allowances using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume  patient demographics  and business conditions 
these allowances are adjusted to reflect actual returns and claim denials 
changes in these factors could affect the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  we provided for sales returns and other sales allowances at a rate of approximately  and of gross revenues  respectively 
the decline in sales returns and other sales allowances as a percentage of gross revenues is primarily attributable to establishing a limitation on the length of time from the initial sale that a return will be authorized 
effective april   polymedica stipulated that diabetes and respiratory supplies could only be returned within six months from the date of sale  as compared with no limitations on product returns in the prior year 
for the fiscal year ended march   a hypothetical change of in the provision for sales returns and other sales allowances as a percentage of gross revenues  would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately million 
the following table details the activity in our accounts receivable valuation reserves for the fiscal years ended march   and there were no amounts recorded as a provision in any of the years presented that related to prior period sales 
accounts receivable valuation reserves in thousands beginning provision for write offs of write offs of ending description balance current year current year sales prior period sales balance fiscal year ended march  allowance for doubtful accounts sales return and other sales allowances fiscal year ended march  allowance for doubtful accounts sales return and other sales allowances fiscal year ended march  allowance for doubtful accounts sales return and other sales allowances advertising in accordance with sop  we capitalize and amortize direct response advertising and related costs when we can demonstrate  among other things  that patients have directly responded to our advertisements 
we assess the realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising costs reported as assets at the end of each reporting period by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets to the probable remaining future net cash flows expected to result directly from such advertising 
management s judgments include determining the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized 
a business change  including a change in reimbursement rates  that reduces expected net cash flows or that shortens the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized could result in accelerated charges against our earnings 
for further discussion regarding the application of sop  please see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 we perform impairment tests at each reporting period and whenever events or changes in circumstance suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing such tests  we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions relating to the allocation of certain assets and liabilities to our reporting units  the fair values of our reporting units  and the related fair value of certain of their assets and liabilities 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used could affect the determination of whether an impairment exists as well as the quantification of the impairment value  should one exist 
for further discussion  please see note e to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents other advertising rates may fluctuate during the year  which may affect our acquisition of new patients 
we may purchase less advertising when rates are higher  which generally occurs in november and december 
as a result  our acquisition of new patients during this period is generally reduced and our net revenues may fluctuate accordingly 
we operate from manufacturing and distribution facilities located in massachusetts and florida  respectively 
virtually all of our product sales are denominated in us dollars 
expense items include cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  each as more fully described below cost of sales consists primarily of purchased finished goods for sale in our markets and shipping and handling and  to a lesser extent  materials  direct labor  and overhead costs for products that we manufacture in our massachusetts facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures for personnel and benefits  amortization of capitalized direct response advertising costs  provision for bad debts  legal and related expenses  depreciation of facilities and equipment  and other amortization and depreciation 
period to period comparisons of changes in net revenues are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period

during the fiscal year ended march   we added approximately  new patients from direct response advertising and business and patient list acquisitions 
the attrition of approximately  patients in fiscal yielded net growth in the liberty diabetes patient base from the prior year of approximately  patients or 

table of contents the following table details the number of the patient profiles acquired through business and patient list acquisitions in the fiscal year ended march  in thousands purchased date of purchase value patient count february  january  november  july  other patient list purchases total net revenue growth generated from the net growth in the patient base was reduced by a cut in medicare reimbursement for diabetes test strips and lancets effective january   which reduced net revenues by approximately million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  the lower reimbursement rate for diabetes test strips and lancets  effective january  as implemented through the medicare modernization act  are expected to remain in effect for the balance of calendar and calendar our growth during the fiscal year ended march  as compared with the prior year was also upset by the interruption in business resulting from the two hurricanes sustained by our florida based facilities  home of our liberty diabetes  liberty respiratory and liberty pharmacy businesses  in the quarter ended september  we have estimated that the hurricanes resulted in the permanent loss of approximately million of net revenues  excluding amounts that may be reimbursed to us through our business interruption insurance  due to the timing of the hurricanes at the end of the second quarter  which prematurely ended the day supply cycle and could not be recovered 
the decrease in liberty respiratory net revenues was due primarily to the reduction in reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs from an average reimbursement rate of approximately of the average wholesale price for the fiscal year ended march   to of the average wholesale price for the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended march  coupled with fourth quarter reimbursement rates equal to of the manufacturers average sales price for inhalation drugs plus a dispensing fee of per day order or per day order  a substantial reduction 
while the reimbursement cuts that went into effect on january  resulted in approximately million less net revenues in the fourth quarter than would have been generated at the reimbursement rates in effect for calendar  the business remained marginally profitable 
reimbursement rates and dispensing fees for these products are highly uncertain beginning in calendar and  as such  we cannot predict our ability to provide inhalation drugs beyond december  despite the changing reimbursement landscape and the decision to suspend television advertising in december  we continued to enroll new patients generated primarily from liberty diabetes referrals in fiscal  which helped offset the approximate annual patient attrition  resulting in an overall decline in the liberty respiratory patient base of approximately 
we continue to evaluate business opportunities for this segment  including potential disposition of the business  possible distribution of oxygen  or forming strategic alliances with other businesses 
the increase in pharmaceuticals net revenues was due primarily to the growth in liberty pharmacy s direct to consumer sales of prescription medications  which represented of total pharmaceuticals segment net revenues in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with in the fiscal year ended march  the primary source of reimbursement is presently third party commercial insurance companies 
patients without commercial insurance coverage are required to pay for their medications at the time of purchase 
commencing january   medicare coverage of prescription drugs will be available under the medicare modernization act through both prescription drug plans and medicare advantage prescription plans 
our goal is to expand our pharmacy business through the acquisition of complementary pharmaceutical companies to help us develop the economies of scale that will allow us to compete successfully in and beyond 
the other businesses included in the pharmaceuticals segment  which conduct the manufacture and sale of over the counter female urinary discomfort products and prescription urology and suppository products from our massachusetts based facility  generated revenues representing of the pharmaceutical segment s net revenues and of total consolidated net revenues in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with of the pharmaceutical segment s net revenues and of total consolidated net revenues in the prior year 
we are currently evaluating whether these non core businesses should be continued in their current forms or 
table of contents whether they should be modified or sold 
we have hired a financial advisor to assist us in evaluating the potential disposition of these businesses

liberty pharmacy  included in our pharmaceuticals segment which realized a gross margin percentage of in fiscal  down from in fiscal  generated a gross margin percentage during the fiscal year ended march  of  as compared with our consolidated gross margin of 
we expect that our gross margin for the foreseeable future will be lower than the levels reported in fiscal and prior periods  primarily as a result of the continued expected increase in liberty pharmacy net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues and medicare reimbursement reductions for inhalation drugs and diabetic testing supplies that went into effect january  selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal year ended march  net net in thousands revenues revenues reported selling  general and administrative expenses employee compensation direct response advertising amortization provision for doubtful accounts direct response advertising impairment charge the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march   was primarily driven by the million impairment charge recorded in fiscal to adjust the carrying value of liberty respiratory s direct response advertising asset down to its net realizable value as a result of the medicare reimbursement reductions for inhalation drugs implemented under the medicare modernization act 
amortization of direct response advertising as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in the fiscal year ended march   to in the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to the prior year write down of million of liberty respiratory s direct response advertising asset and a million decrease in direct response advertising expenditures in the fiscal year ended march  as compared with the prior year 
had amortization of direct response advertising remained at of net revenues as reported in the fiscal year ended march   the expense in fiscal would have been approximately million higher than reported 
a reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was due to improved collection experience and an increase in liberty pharmacy net revenues  approximately of which are paid in cash at the time of purchase 
had our provision for doubtful accounts remained at of net revenues as reported in the fiscal year ended march   the expense in fiscal would have been approximately million higher than reported 

table of contents realized economies of scale resulting from our growing business and progress in our efforts to identify opportunities to streamline our business were other key factors in the improvement  as evidenced by the decrease in employee compensation as a percentage of net revenues  due primarily to improved utilization of existing staff and fewer new hires

the income tax provision rate decreased from in the fiscal year ended march  to in the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of a reduction in state income tax expense in the various jurisdictions where we file  and an increase in tax exempt investment income 
our effective tax rate varies from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to federal or state tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying state or local income tax rates  and the deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction

the average net revenue generated per shipment remained fairly consistent 
the increase in liberty respiratory net revenues was due primarily to the growth in our patient base  which grew to approximately  active patients as of march   from approximately  as of march   as a result of our national television advertising 
net revenue growth in our liberty respiratory segment slowed during fiscal year as a result of several factors  including our suspension of direct response advertising to respiratory patients in december in response to new medicare legislation  lower than expected response rate to the advertisements that we ran in the period and increased competition 
net revenues for this segment declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared with the fiscal fourth quarter  as a result of the cut in medicare reimbursement rates effective january  the new medicare legislation is discussed in further detail in item of part i reportable segments liberty respiratory 
the increase in pharmaceuticals net revenue was due primarily to the growth in liberty pharmacy direct to consumer sales of prescription medications to existing liberty diabetes and respiratory patients 
sales of these products represented and of total pharmaceuticals segment net revenues in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the current patient base for these products consists primarily of existing liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory patients and their spouses

it is our policy that collection efforts may be active up to months from the last billing date  after which time balances are to be written off as soon as administratively possible 
balances that are determined to be uncollectible prior to the passage of months from the last billing date are written off as soon as administratively possible after that determination has been made 
we have also made progress in our efforts to identify opportunities to streamline our business  thereby reducing operating expenses and increasing cash flows as expenditures decreased as a percentage of net revenues in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  cash flow generated from these activities was used to purchase million of direct response advertising  make a million payment to the doj in accordance with the settlement agreement reached on november  and discussed in more detail in item of part i legal proceedings  pay million in dividend payments to polymedica shareholders  and acquire million of certain business assets of diabetes supply companies and million of patient lists 
the growth of our business is currently funded primarily through cash flow generated from operations 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march   was driven primarily by the million settlement payment funded in november as discussed above 
also contributing to the decrease in cash flows from operations was a million increase in reported inventory levels during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in purchasing activity was conducted to secure favorable inventory pricing 
partially offsetting the settlement payment and the increased inventory purchases was an million reduction in income tax payments during the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  the lower tax payments were primarily the result of lower reported net income due to the tax deductible million settlement charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal also offsetting the decrease in cash flows from operations was a million decrease in direct response advertising spending in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  we will continue to engage in a high level of television advertising in fiscal  which combined with our proactive approach and high level of service to existing patients  has resulted in solid revenue growth 
the million increase in total cash used for investing activities in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to a million increase in amounts paid to purchase business assets and patient lists 
of the total million increase in cash outflow for the purchase of such assets  million related to the purchase of substantially all of the assets of national diabetic assistance corporation ndac including a patient list for million  combined with a million increase in the purchase of other patient lists during the fiscal year 
this increase was offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of million from million during the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to renovations on the  square foot facility we purchased in january  to million in the fiscal year ended march   excluding the million ndac facility purchase  as well as proceeds raised of  from the net maturity of marketable securities in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with cash outflow of million in the prior year for net purchase activity 
the million decrease in total cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to a million decrease in proceeds raised from employee 
table of contents stock option exercises 
also contributing to the decrease in total cash provided by financing activities was a million increase in cash dividend payments to shareholders offset by a million decrease in payments of obligations under capital leases and notes payable 
our current intention is to pay a cash dividend to polymedica common shareholders on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future 
we expect the cash dividend payment will range between million and million per quarter in fiscal  dependant on the number of shares repurchased through the modified dutch auction tender offer discussed below 
other financing activities included amounts set aside to fund executive deferred compensation plans 
to aid in the pursuit of our strategic goals  we entered into a million five year revolving credit facility in april  which we increased to million in may also in may  we initiated a modified dutch auction tender offer 
pursuant to the tender offer  which will close on june  unless extended  we will purchase shares of our common stock for up to approximately million 
we plan to borrow up to million from our credit facility to pay for shares in the tender offer 
we believe that investing in our own shares in the tender offer is an attractive use of our capital 
the remaining available balance of the credit facility will be available to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  and for other general corporate purposes 
commitments lease  note payable  rental and purchase commitments we have various contractual obligations that affect our liquidity 
the following represents future payments for our contractual obligations including our capital and operating leases and rental and purchase commitments as of march  payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations note payable purchase obligations total contractual obligations we have committed to purchasing approximately million in advertising spots  included in the table above  from various television networks in the fiscal year ending march  we entered into these purchase commitments to obtain favorable advertising rates 
in connection with the purchase of the assets of national diabetic assistance corporation in january we incurred a note payable of million with a net present value of million 
the note was discounted at a rate of prime borrowing rate at the time of purchase with an estimated term of two years  resulting in a net present value of million 
the imputed unamortized debt discount of  will be amortized as interest expense on a straight line basis over the expected life of the note  which is due in years or upon fulfillment of certain performance criteria

cms is currently conducting such a review 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of march  of million will be sufficient to meet working capital  capital expenditure and financing needs  including the payment of dividends to shareholders  for future business operations 
subsequent to march   we secured a million line of credit  a portion of which will be used to repurchase shares under the modified dutch auction tender offer we announced in may we plan to spend up to million repurchasing shares of our common stock under this tender offer 
other factors which could negatively affect our liquidity include  among other things  a reduction in the demand for our products  an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation  or a reduction in medicare reimbursement for our products 
sales of a significant portion of our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory segments depend on the continued availability of medicare reimbursement 
effective january   the medicare modernization act reduced reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs  which we sell through our liberty respiratory segment  as well as reducing reimbursement rates for diabetes test strips and lancets by approximately  which we sell through our liberty diabetes segment

accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   or our fiscal year commencing on april  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that the cost of share based compensation including those with employees and non employees be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r applies to all share based compensation including shares  share options  and other equity instruments or that require settlement by the issuance of an entity s shares or other equity instruments 

table of contents this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the adoption of the statement will result in the expensing of the fair value of stock options granted to employees in the basic financial statements 
previously  we elected to only disclose the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements 
see accounting for stock based compensation in note a to the financial statements 
we are required to adopt sfas r effective april  and are currently in the process of evaluating its impact on our results 
sfas r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under sfas for the pro forma disclosure 
the adoption of sfas r is expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adopting sfas r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
however  had we adopted sfas r in a prior period  the impact would approximate the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires that tax benefits received in excess of compensation cost be reclassified from operating cash flows to financing cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
this change in classification will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  which is an amendment to apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the adoption of fas no 
 effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   or our fiscal year commencing on april   is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents factors affecting future operating results our future operating results remain difficult to predict 
we continue to face many risks and uncertainties which could affect our operating results  including without limitation  those described below 
we could experience significantly reduced revenues and profits if medicare or other government programs change  delay or deny reimbursement sales of a significant portion of our liberty diabetes  liberty respiratory and pharmaceuticals segments depend on the continued availability of reimbursement of our patients by government and private insurance plans 
any reduction in medicare or other government program or private plan reimbursements currently available for our products would reduce our revenues 
certain significant reimbursement reductions that became effective january  under the medicare modernization act are discussed in item of part i reportable segments liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory 
other future reimbursement reductions are possible 
without a corresponding reduction in the cost of such products  the result would be a reduction in our overall profit margin 
similarly  any increase in the cost of such products would reduce our overall profit margin unless there was a corresponding increase in medicare or other government program reimbursement 
our profits could also be affected by the imposition of more stringent regulatory requirements for medicare or other government program reimbursement or adjustments to previously reimbursed amounts 
the medicare modernization act also provides for a program for competitive bidding of certain durable medical equipment items  including diabetes test strips  beginning january  if the liberty diabetes segment is excluded from the bid award or the bid does not place value on liberty s patient service model  the operating results of the liberty diabetes segment could be negatively affected 
as part of the civil settlement  on november  we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement 
this agreement provides for an annual review of a sample of our medicare claims by an independent review organization for a year period  which could be reduced to a shorter period at the discretion of the oig  and obligates us to continue our compliance program and the measures we have implemented to promote our compliance with medicare regulations 
should the financial error rate of the sample reviewed by the independent review organization for any given period  exceed the acceptable error rate  we could be subject to a potentially material overpayment assessment for that period 
the government s medicare regulations are complex and sometimes subjective and therefore may require management s interpretation 
overpayments by medicare and others occur in the normal course of business and reserves are recorded when  based upon our assessment of the facts and circumstance  we believe that the amounts due to medicare and others are probable and estimable 
we are currently involved in litigation and could experience reduced net income if this litigation is not resolved in our favor polymedica and three former officers of polymedica are defendants in a lawsuit alleging violations of certain sections and rules of the exchange act  which was initiated in us district court for the district of massachusetts in november polymedica believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims made against it in this action in which it is a defendant and intends to contest the claims vigorously 
we cannot accurately predict the outcome of this proceeding at this time  and have therefore not recorded any charges relating to this proceeding 
an unfavorable outcome could cause us to be liable for damages  which would reduce our net income in any such period 
please see item of part i  legal proceedings  for a more complete description of this claim 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have a material adverse effect on our stock price we must continue to document  test and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires annual reports by management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm attesting to management s assessment and the effectiveness of the internal control 
we have expended and expect that we will continue to expend significant time and resources documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting 
while management s evaluation as of march  resulted in the conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of that date  we cannot predict the outcome of testing in future periods 
if we conclude in future periods that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is not able to render the required attestations  it could result in lost investor confidence in the accuracy  reliability and completeness of our financial reports 
any such events could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

table of contents the market price of our common stock may experience substantial fluctuations for reasons over which we have little control 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market system 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially based on a variety of factors  including  among others fluctuations in our quarterly results  announcements concerning us  our competitors  the drug manufacturers with whom we have relationships or the healthcare market  overall volatility of the stock market  changes in government regulations  changes in the financial estimates we provide to the market or estimates by analysts  and loss of key executives 
furthermore  stock prices for many companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results 
these fluctuations  coupled with changes in our results of operations and general economic  political and market conditions  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we plan to continue our expansion  if we do not manage our growth successfully  our growth and profitability may slow or stop the expansion of our operations has created significant demand on our administrative  operational and financial personnel and other resources 
additional expansion in existing or new markets could strain these resources and increase our need for capital 
our personnel  systems  procedures  controls and existing space may not be adequate to support further expansion 
geopolitical events may reduce our ability to obtain favorable advertising rates for our direct response advertising efforts  which may increase our expenses and or lead to a reduction in revenues the effectiveness of our direct response advertising is subject to the risks arising from geopolitical events 
for example  around the clock news coverage on the war in iraq and the war on terrorism affected our ability to obtain favorable rates for our product advertisements and thus affected our ability to obtain new patients since we reduced our advertising 
such geopolitical events may in the foreseeable future have a negative impact on our results of operations by increasing our expenses and or leading to a reduction in our revenues 
the profitability of our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory segments will decrease if we do not receive recurring orders from patients the profitability of our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory segments depends in large part on recurring and sustained reorders 
reorder rates are inherently uncertain due to several factors  many of which are outside our control  including changing patient preferences  competitive price pressures  patient transition to extended care facilities  patient mortality and general economic conditions 
we generally incur losses and negative cash flow with respect to the first order from a new patient  due primarily to the marketing and regulatory compliance costs associated with initial patient qualification 
we could experience significantly reduced profits from our liberty diabetes segment if new technologies that reduce or eliminate the need for consumable testing supplies are developed for glucose monitoring the majority of our liberty diabetes net revenues are from consumable testing supplies  used to draw and test small quantities of blood for the purpose of measuring and monitoring glucose levels 
numerous research efforts are underway to develop more convenient and less intrusive glucose measurement techniques 
the commercialization and widespread acceptance of new technologies that eliminate or reduce the need for consumable testing supplies could negatively affect our liberty diabetes segment 

table of contents we could experience a charge to earnings as a result of an impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets we are required to perform impairment tests under sfas no 
annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the valuation of our goodwill and other intangible assets is based upon the results of these impairment tests 
changes in assumptions used and forecasted results of operations for the reporting unit carrying goodwill or other intangible assets  could affect the quantification of an impairment value  should one exist 
since our growth strategy may involve the acquisition of other companies  we may record additional goodwill in the future 
the possible write off of this goodwill could negatively impact our future earnings 
we will also be required to allocate a portion of the purchase price of any acquisition to the value of non competition agreements  patient base and contracts that are acquired 
the amount allocated to these items could be amortized over a fairly short period 
as a result  our earnings and the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted 
we could be liable for harm caused by products that we sell and may incur significant expenses in connection with the defense of any product liability claims the sale of medical products entails the risk that users will make product liability claims 
if any such product liability claim is successful  we could be liable for a significant amount of damages 
even if we are ultimately successful on the merits of any such claim  we could incur significant expenses in connection with the defense of any such claim 
our insurance may not provide adequate coverage for any such damages and or expenses 
we could lose patients and revenues to new or existing competitors competition from other sellers of products offered through our liberty diabetes  liberty respiratory and pharmaceuticals segments  manufacturers of healthcare products  pharmaceutical companies and other competitors is intense and expected to increase 
many of our competitors and potential competitors are large companies with well known names and substantial resources 
these companies may develop products and services that are more effective or less expensive than any that we are developing or selling 
they may also promote and market these products more successfully than we promote and market our products 
loss of use of manufacturing or data storage facilities could significantly reduce revenues and profits from our businesses we manufacture substantially all of our prescription urology and suppository products and many of our azo brand name products at our facility in woburn  massachusetts 
in addition  we process and store most of our patient data in our facility in port st 
lucie  florida 
if we cannot use any of these facilities as a result of the fda  occupational safety and health administration or other regulatory action  fire  natural disaster or other event  our revenues and profits would decrease significantly 
for example  as a result of the disruption caused by the two hurricanes sustained by our port st 
lucie based facilities in  excluding amounts that may be reimbursed to us through our business interruption and property and casualty insurance  we experienced reduced revenues of approximately million and incurred losses in excess of million 
if we or our suppliers do not comply with applicable government regulations  we may be prohibited from selling our products and or may incur fines and other expenses the majority of the products that we sell are regulated by the fda and other regulatory agencies 
if any of these agencies mandate a suspension of production or sales of our products or mandate a recall  we may lose sales and incur fines and other expenses until we are in compliance with the regulations or change to another acceptable supplier 
we could have difficulty selling our pharmaceuticals products if we cannot maintain and expand our sales to distributors we rely on third party distributors to market and sell our over the counter female urinary discomfort products and prescription urology and suppository products 
future sales of these products depend in part on our maintaining and expanding marketing and distribution relationships with pharmaceutical  medical device  personal care and other distributors and on the success of those distributors in marketing and selling our products 

table of contents our quarterly revenues or operating results could vary  which may cause the market price of our securities to decline we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and anticipate that such fluctuations could continue 
results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including changes in reimbursement guidelines and amounts  changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry  changes in suppliers  the timing of patient orders  the timing and cost of our advertising campaigns  the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new products offered by us or our competitors  and changes in the mix of our products  product costs are significantly influenced by the product brand chosen by the patients of our mail order diabetes supply business 
we provide a wide range of product brand choices to our patients  purchased at varying costs from suppliers 
our ability to sustain current gross margin levels is dependent both on our ability to continue securing favorable pricing from suppliers and on the brand choices of our patients 
a reduction in working capital or a change in our business could prevent us from paying dividends to shareholders a significant decline in our cash balances or a change in our business could cause us to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends to shareholders 
we may make acquisitions that will strain our financial and operational resources we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses products and assets 
acquisitions involve a number of risks that might adversely affect our financial and operational resources  including diversion of the attention of senior management from important business matters  amortization of substantial intangible assets  difficulty in retaining key personnel of an acquired business  lack of adequate internal control over financial reporting  failure to assimilate operations of an acquired business  possible operating losses and expenses of an acquired business  exposure to legal claims for activities of an acquired business prior to acquisition  and incurrence of debt and related interest expense 
we could also require substantial capital resources to acquire complementary products or businesses 
we cannot be certain that existing or additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents we may issue preferred stock with rights senior to our common stock our articles of organization authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval 
the shares may have dividend  voting  liquidation and other rights and preferences that are senior to the rights of our common stock 
the rights and preferences of any such class or series of preferred stock would be established by our board in its sole discretion
