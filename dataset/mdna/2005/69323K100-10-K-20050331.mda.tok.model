item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading multi category online discount retailer of high quality new  close out and refurbished brand name merchandise 
we currently offer over  products in twelve merchandise categories  including computer hardware and software  home electronics  digital imaging  watches and jewelry  housewares  dvd movies  video games travel  bed and bath  apparel and accessories  licensed sports gear and cellular wireless 
we appeal to a broad range of consumer and small business customers through what we believe is a unique and convenient buying experience offering two shopping formats every day low price and our proprietary bargain countdown 
this combination of shopping formats helps attract value conscious customers to our ecost 
com website who are looking for high quality products at low prices 
we also offer a fee based membership program to develop customer loyalty by providing subscribers exclusive access to preferential offers 
we provide rapid response customer service utilizing a strategically located distribution center and third party fulfillment providers  as well as customer support from online and on call sales representatives 
we offer suppliers an efficient sales channel for merchandise in all stages of the product life cycle 
we were originally formed in february as a subsidiary of pc mall  which is a rapid response supplier of technology solutions for businesses  government and educational institutions  as well as consumers 
our initial strategy was to establish a retail website focused primarily on new and current release computer hardware  software  peripherals and networking products priced aggressively to achieve higher sales volumes 
we were also focused on building brand awareness and growing our customer base 
in mid  we changed our focus to emphasize profitability over growth by reducing our advertising expenditures  reducing customer acquisition costs  improving product margins  expanding our product categories and introducing a greater level of close out and refurbished products to our merchandise mix 
from november until april  we also offered our products through an auction format  from which we derived net sales of  from the beginning of through april when we discontinued our auction format 
we have operated as a reporting segment of pc mall s business since april in september  we completed an initial public offering of  shares our common stock  leaving pc mall with ownership of approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
pc mall has announced that on april   it plans to distribute its remaining ownership interest in our company to its common stockholders which will take the form of a spin off by means of a special dividend to its common stockholders of all of our common stock owned by pc mall 
completion of the distribution is subject to certain conditions as described in the master separation and distribution agreement previously entered into between us and pc mall 
the distribution may not occur by the contemplated time or may not occur at all 
our financial results are influenced by factors in the marketplace in which we operate and our successful execution of our business strategy 
marketplace factors include competition for customers  product pricing  online advertising costs  growth in online shopping  and promotional offers such as coupons and free shipping 
we expect that the online marketplace environment will remain a price competitive and promotion driven environment where companies that run efficient  high volume operations thrive 
our ability to execute our business strategy successfully will require us to meet a number of challenges  particularly our ability to remain price competitive while maintaining or increasing our gross margins  establish separate operations  vendor relationships  and inventory management and fulfillment functions  continue to find efficient ways to invest in advertising as we grow our customer base  
table of contents maintain or increase our levels of vendor marketing and co op advertising funds  and develop and grow new merchandise categories 
basis of presentation our financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of pc mall  in which we have been reported as a separate segment  using the historical results of operations  and historical basis of assets and liabilities of our business 
the statements of operations include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically provided to us by pc mall  including administrative services accounting  human resources  tax services  legal and treasury  inventory management and order fulfillment  credit card processing  information systems operation and administration  advertising services  and use of office space 
these allocations were made on a specifically identifiable basis or using the relative percentages  as compared to pc mall s other businesses  of net sales  payroll  net cost of goods sold  square footage  headcount or other 
we have not made a determination of whether these expenses are comparable to those we could have obtained from an unrelated third party 
our expenses as a separate  stand alone company may be higher or lower than the amounts reflected in the statements of operations 
we believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable 
however  the financial statements may not necessarily reflect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future or what our results of operations  financial position and cash flows would have been had we been a separate  stand alone company during the periods presented 
the historical financial information presented in this report does not reflect the many significant changes that will occur in our funding and operations as a result of our becoming a public company or our spin off from pc mall 
financial operations overview our management monitors a variety of financial and non financial metrics on a daily  weekly and monthly basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary 
we believe that the most important of these measures include sales  orders shipped  website traffic  active customers  new customers  number of orders  average order value  gross margin  co op advertising revenues  customer acquisition costs  advertising expense  personnel costs  fulfillment costs  relationship manager productivity  and accounts receivable aging for our business customers 
management compares the various metrics against goals and budgets  and takes appropriate action to enhance our performance 
our management also monitors additional measures such as liquidity and cash resources 
as we transition to becoming an independent company  we anticipate that management will focus on further measures such as inventory turnover 
we derive our revenue from sales of products and services to consumers and businesses 
consumer sales consist of orders placed through our ecost 
com website or by inbound telephone orders 
business sales consist of sales made to customers assigned a customer relationship manager 
in addition  business sales include orders placed through customized corporate websites 
sales to unassigned business customers are included in consumer sales 
we also recently launched our travel and cellular wireless categories in which we have arrangements with third party service providers and receive commissions for products and services purchased by linking through our ecost 
com website 
we further generate revenue from handling fees and shipping fees we charge our customers  as well as other services 
we record our revenue net of returns  coupons  credit card fraud and chargebacks  and other discounts 
our revenues may fluctuate from period to period as a result of special offers we provide such as free shipping  coupons and other special promotions 
consumer sales represented  and of our total net sales for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
business sales represented  and of our total net sales for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
no single customer accounted for more than of our total net sales for or our revenue is dependant in part on sales of hp and hp related products which represent  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
in connection with the distribution  we will have to obtain authorization from hp to buy directly from hp 
to the extent we are unable to buy directly from hp  we may have 
table of contents to seek alternative sources of hp and hp related products which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and operating results 
we believe that the principal drivers of our revenue consist of the average order value placed by our customers  the number of orders placed by both existing and new customers  special offers we make available that result in incremental orders  our ability to attract new customers and advertising that impacts the aforementioned drivers of our revenue 
our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of computer hardware  software  peripherals  electronics  and other consumer products to individual consumers and businesses through the internet  dedicated telemarketing sales executives  relationship based telemarketing techniques  direct response catalogs and advertisements 
we also generate commission based revenue for certain products and other marketing and promotional services generated through our ecost 
com website 
during the fourth quarter of  we added the travel and cellular wireless categories to our website 
we use third party fulfillment partners to supply the travel services such as flights  hotels and rental cars and cellular phones and service 
for these products and services  we do not have inventory risk or pricing control  and do not provide customer service 
therefore  for these sales we are not considered to be the primary obligor  and record only our commission as revenue 
we believe there is a moderate level of seasonality in our business  reflecting fluctuations in online commerce and the general pattern of peak sales for the retail industry during the holiday shopping season 
sales in the traditional retail industry are generally higher in the first and fourth calendar quarters of the year 
we believe that our historical revenue growth makes it difficult to predict the effect of seasonality on our future revenues and results of operations 
cost of goods sold primarily consists of the cost of the product  inbound and outbound shipping  fixed and variable fulfillment costs charged to us by pc mall and restocking fees on returned products charged to us by pc mall 
cost of goods sold is reduced by certain vendor consideration  such as market development funds and co operative co op advertising funds  which has been sold by our vendor marketing team and allocated and credited to us by pc mall 
for our  and fiscal years  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales from products sold out of inventory purchased from pc mall  and we purchased the remaining inventory from independent suppliers 
we expect to begin purchasing substantially all of our inventory from independent suppliers other than pc mall prior to the completion of the distribution 
gross profit consists of net sales less product costs  inbound and outbound shipping costs and offset by certain marketing development funds 
such funds are received from manufacturers of products included in our catalogs and web sites  as well as co operative advertising funds co op on products purchased from manufacturers and vendors 
our gross profit margins are impacted by a number of factors 
gross profit margin may vary depending on various factors  including the category of merchandise  the introduction of new product categories  the mix of sales among our product categories  pricing of products by our vendors  fluctuations in key vendor support programs and price protection  pricing strategies  promotional programs  market conditions  packaging  excess and obsolete inventory charges  and other factors 
prior to the completion of our spin off from pc mall  we expect to transition to performing inventory management and order fulfillment functions on our own 
the fulfillment costs included in cost of goods sold for our  and fiscal years were million  million and million respectively 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses  including online marketing activities and the costs of catalog production  other costs  such as personnel  rent  common area maintenance  depreciation  credit card processing charges bad debt expenditures  legal and accounting fees and administrative service charges from affiliates of pc mall 
as a result of our recent initial public offering  we have incurred and expect that we will incur additional general and administrative expenses related to operating as a public company  such as increased legal and accounting expenses  increased executive compensation  personnel and employee benefit costs  investor relations costs  non employee director costs and higher insurance premiums 
until completion of our initial public offering  we were a co borrower under pc mall s million commercial line of credit  which included a million flooring facility 
the lenders for these lines released us from all obligations under these credit facilities upon completion of our initial public offering 
pc mall directly received all proceeds under this line of credit  and directly paid all principal and interest with respect thereto 
although we did not directly utilize proceeds from this line of credit and separately account for amounts we borrowed from pc 
table of contents mall  because we were a co borrower  along with all of the other pc mall subsidiaries  with joint and several liability under such line of credit  the outstanding balance under the pc mall commercial line of credit included in pc mall s consolidated financial statements was included for financial reporting purposes in our stand alone financial statements 
as described below and in note to our financial statements  our financial statements reflect offsetting interest expense and interest income with respect to such line of credit for periods prior to completion of our initial public offering 
interest income expense represents a charge by pc mall for advances to us for working capital through we calculated the amount of this interest expense monthly using the prime rate in effect at such time multiplied by the cumulative balance due to pc mall  net of an amount equal to the amount of approximately one month s inventory purchases to approximate standard vendor terms 
interest income in is a result of our investment of the net proceeds of our initial public offering proceeds in investment grade  interest bearing marketable securities 
interest expense pc mall commercial line of credit represents pc mall s consolidated interest expense for advances under its commercial line of credit made to pc mall to fund the operations of its consolidated group 
interest income pc mall commercial line of credit represents our recognition of interest income from pc mall to reimburse us for the consolidated debt obligation that we record in our financial statements and that reflects pc mall s cost to fund the operations of its consolidated group 
all costs associated with pc mall s borrowings to fund our operations have been recorded under interest expense pc mall 
income taxes were calculated as if we had filed separate tax returns for the periods presented 
however  pc mall has managed its tax position for the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses  and its tax strategies are not necessarily reflective of the tax strategies that we would have followed or will follow as a stand alone company 
as described below  the release of a million valuation allowance on deferred tax assets had a significant favorable impact on our results of operations 
in and  we granted non qualified stock options to certain of our and pc mall s employees 
these options were exercisable only upon the earlier to occur of an initial public offering or sale of our company or a period of five to seven years following the grant date of the options 
certain awards contain repurchase rights at the original exercise price in the event of employee termination  which right would terminate in the event of an initial public offering or sale of our company 
as a result of the contingent nature of these options  a new measurement date for options granted to our employees occurred upon the consummation of our initial public offering  and we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense equal to the difference between the exercise prices of these options and the initial public offering price for these options 
based on the initial public offering price of per share  we recorded a non cash stock based compensation charge of million in connection with these options upon completion of our initial public offering 
in march  we granted an option to purchase  shares of common stock to our chief executive officer at an exercise price of per share 
this grant resulted in the recognition of deferred non cash stock based compensation based on the estimated deemed fair value of the common stock on the date of grant of 
an aggregate of of the shares of common stock subject to this option vested upon the completion of our initial public offering 
the remainder of the shares of common stock subject to this option will vest in equal quarterly installments over a three year period following the offering 
we recorded a non cash stock based compensation charge of million in the year ended december  to reflect compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of shares under this option as a result of our initial public offering 
we will amortize the additional million of compensation expense relating to the march option over the remainder of the three year vesting period 
we recognized total compensation expense of million in connection with all of our outstanding options in the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  as well as the disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and we include any revisions to our estimates in our results for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
our management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
we adhere to the revised guidelines and principles of sales recognition described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  issued as a revision to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
while the wording of sab has revised the original sab  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab under sab  sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
under these guidelines  we recognize a majority of our sales  including revenue from product sales and gross outbound shipping and handling charges  upon receipt of the product by the customer 
for all product sales shipped directly from suppliers to customers  we are the primary obligor in the transaction  and we take title to the products sold upon shipment  bear credit risk  and bear inventory risk for returned products that are not successfully returned to suppliers  therefore  we recognize these revenues at gross sales amounts 
sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances  coupon redemptions and credit card fraud and chargebacks  all of which are estimated based upon recent historical information such as return and redemption rates  and fraud and chargeback experience 
management also considers any other current information and trends in making estimates 
our coupon redemptions are based upon the quantity of eligible orders transacted during the period and the estimated redemption rate  using historical experience rates for similar products or coupon amounts 
estimated redemption rates and the related coupon expense and liability are regularly adjusted as actual coupon redemptions for the program are processed 
if actual sales returns  allowances  discounts  coupon redemptions and credit card fraud and chargebacks are greater than estimated by management  additional expense may be incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon estimates of future collection 
we extend credit to our business customers based upon an evaluation of each business customer s financial condition and credit history  and generally do not require collateral 
our business customers financial conditions and credit and payment histories are evaluated in determining the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts subsequently prove insufficient  additional allowance may be required 
reserve for inventory obsolescence 
pc mall maintains allowances for the valuation of inventory by estimating the obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on the difference between inventory cost and market value determined by general market conditions  nature  age and type of each product 
at such time as we establish our own inventory management and order fulfillment facilities  we plan to use a similar methodology for determining our inventory reserves 
pc mall allocates and charges a portion of such allowance to us in the form of a restocking fee  and regularly evaluates the adequacy of its inventory reserve and determines the amount of such reserve to allocate and charge to us 
if the inventory reserve subsequently proves insufficient  additional inventory write downs may be required  which is recorded as an increase in cost of goods sold 
this additional write down amounted to less than million in  and income taxes 
our income tax provision is computed as if a separate company tax return were being filed 
however  pc mall files a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined state income tax return that include 
table of contents our operating results 
we account for income taxes under the liability method  under which we recognize deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the tax bases and financial reporting amounts of our existing assets and liabilities 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in making this assessment  we are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
based on our current forecasts and projections supporting the future utilization of deferred tax benefits  our recent earnings history  and the fact that net operating losses of million are not limited with respect to their utilization and are available over a remaining carryover period of approximately to years to offset future taxable income  we have not recorded a valuation allowance at december  or december  in the event that actual results differ from those estimates or we adjust those estimates in future periods  we may need to record a valuation allowance  which may impact deferred tax assets and the results of operations in the period the change is made 
our relationship with and separation from pc mall as a subsidiary of pc mall  we have received services provided by pc mall  including administrative services accounting  human resources  tax services  legal and treasury  inventory management and order fulfillment  credit card processing  information systems operation and administration  advertising services  and use of office space 
in consideration for these services  pc mall has historically allocated and charged to us a portion of its related overhead costs 
management believes that the amounts charged to us by pc mall generally have been no less favorable to us than costs we would have incurred to obtain such services on our own or from unaffiliated third parties 
as a result of our initial public offering  we expect to incur certain costs in connection with operating as a stand alone company that will exceed the costs that we historically incurred or were charged to us by pc mall 
we anticipate that we will incur incremental operating expenses as a result of becoming a stand alone public company 
these costs include certain administrative costs for services historically performed for us by pc mall  as well as other incremental costs we will incur  including increased legal and accounting expenses  increased executive compensation  personnel and employee benefit costs  investor relations costs  non employee director costs and higher insurance premiums 
after our spin off from pc mall  we expect that we will have additional costs for software and systems to the extent they are not available on terms as favorable as those we receive as a subsidiary of pc mall 
we currently outsource our inventory management and order fulfillment operations to pc mall who will continue to provide such services until the spin off 
in january  we signed a lease for our own distribution facility located near the fedex main hub in memphis  tennessee and are currently building out the facility 
we expect this new facility to be operational by early april we estimate that we will need to spend approximately million in capital expenditures through to establish ourselves as an independent company 
these expenditures will include warehouse and distribution equipment  additional hardware and software for our computer systems  and furniture and fixtures 
we expect to fund the purchase of such capital equipment with existing working capital 
in connection with our initial public offering  we entered into agreements with pc mall and or its affiliates related to the separation of our business operations from pc mall and certain ongoing relationships between us and pc mall following the initial public offering 
these agreements cover administrative services  office space  inventory management and order fulfillment  information systems operation and administration  employee benefits  intellectual property matters  and other ongoing relationships 
these agreements provide for specified charges generally intended to allow the providing company to fully recover the allocated direct costs of providing the services  plus all out of pocket costs and expenses  plus an additional on administrative and other services 
under our arrangement with pc mall  we purchase products from pc mall at its cost  net of the value of any special discounts or incentives obtained by pc mall  and we pay a per shipment fulfillment fee  a monthly inventory management fee and restocking fees 
we believe that these costs are generally consistent with the historical costs we were charged by pc mall for these services 
under our transition agreements with pc mall  we receive credit for any vendor consideration obtained by pc mall in amounts determined consistent with past practices 
we expect to establish our own inventory management and order fulfillment capabilities prior to the completion of our spin off from pc mall 
after we have completed this transition  we will obtain any vendor consideration directly from our vendors instead of through pc mall 
a description of these arrangements is contained under the heading certain relationships and related transactions in our registration statement on form s filed in connection with our initial public offering 
we amended our administrative services agreement with an affiliate of pc mall on march  whereby the scope of the services was reduced and monthly service charges were correspondingly reduced 
table of contents from approximately  to  effective as of the date of the spin off 
under the amended agreement  services will consist of payroll administration  tax return preparation  human resources administration  product information management  catalog advertising production services and accounting and finance services necessary for the preparation of our financial statements for periods through the date of our spin off from pc mall 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total net sales for the periods indicated

net sales in the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  over the increase in sales was primarily due to a related increase of in active customers from the prior year 
new customers for the year ended december  increased by compared to the prior year due to increased awareness of our website derived from additional advertising spending during the year 
we also added the following merchandising categories to our website during the year video games  travel  bed and bath  apparel and accessories  licensed sports gear and cellular wireless 
the main products which contributed to the growth in net sales were notebook computers  home electronics and digital imaging products 
gross profit 
gross profit in the year ended december  was million  an increase of million over the prior year 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to from in the prior year  primarily due to additional promotional offers to accelerate customer acquisitions 
gross profit may be influenced from year to year due to changes in vendor support programs including price protection  rebates and return policies  product mix  pricing strategies  competition and other factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses in the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  over the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to million of non recurring charges and increased personnel costs of million  increased advertising expenses of million  increased credit card processing charges of million and increased consulting expenses of million due to the increase in net sales over the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses for the year ended december  were compared to in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased from the prior year primarily due to the non recurring charges  as described above  equal to and increased consulting expense of 
these increases were offset by a decline in pc mall administrative service charges of as a percentage of net sales 
the administrative service charges have been generally allocated and charged using several factors  including net sales  cost of goods sold  square footage  systems utilization  headcount and other factors 
since our initial public offering  these charges have been based 
table of contents upon monthly fees pursuant to the administrative services agreement and information technology systems usage and services agreement with pc mall 
interest income expense 
interest expense decreased to zero from million in the prior year due to pc mall s additional investment of million in ecost 
com in early  which reduced the amount of advances to us from pc mall to a net receivable 
we recognized interest income in the amount of million in from our investment of the net proceeds of our initial public offering in investment grade  interest bearing marketable securities 
interest expense pc mall commercial line of credit is offset in each reported period by interest income pc mall commercial line of credit 
these amounts decreased in the year ended december  by million from the prior year primarily due to our release from all obligations under the pc mall commercial line of credit and related term note effective upon the closing of our initial public offering on september income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit for the year ended december  of million due to the loss incurred during the year 
in we recorded a benefit of million for income taxes primarily as a result of the release of the full amount of our million valuation allowance based upon our reassessment of our deferred tax assets as being more likely than not recoverable 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our generating sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of million at december  which have a to year life before expiration 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
pc mall may utilize a portion of these net operating losses for any year in which our financial statements can be consolidated with pc mall 
to the extent pc mall does so  that will reduce the amount of net operating loss carryforwards available to us in the future 
net loss was million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to net income of million  or per share  for the same period last year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales in were million  an increase of million  or  over the increase in sales was driven primarily by an increase in daily visits to our website  an increase in sales and shipping promotions  and our increased focus on business customers by expanding our team of sales account representatives 
sales of business related products  including notebook computers  networking and storage products  increased by million from  and sales of consumer related products  including home electronics and digital imaging products  increased by million from gross profit 
gross profit in was million  an increase of million  or  over gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the prior year  primarily due to increased promotional activities such as the issuance of mail in rebates and reduced shipping rates totaling of sales  increased warehouse and fulfillment costs of of net sales due to a decline in average order values  partially offset by improvement in product margin totaling of net sales 
our gross profit percentage may vary from period to period  depending on the continuation of key vendor support programs  including price protection  rebates and return policies  product mix  pricing strategies  competition and other factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses in were million  an increase of million  or  over the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to increases in advertising expenditures of million  and increased credit card processing charges of million on the higher level of sales 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses in were versus in the decline in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to a decline in personnel costs and a decline in administrative service charges from pc mall 
the dollar amount of these expense items in are substantially the same as the prior year and  thus  declined as a percentage of net sales due to sales growth 
the administrative service charges have been generally allocated and charged to us using several factors  including net sales  cost of goods sold  square footage  systems utilization  headcount and other factors 
since the initial public offering  these charges have been based on a monthly fee pursuant to our administrative services agreement with pc mall 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to pc mall s additional investment of million in our company  which reduced the amount of advances to 
table of contents us from pc mall to a net receivable and thereby reduced our interest expense for interest expense pc mall commercial line of credit is offset in each reported period by interest income pc mall commercial line of credit 
these amounts increased in by million from due to increased borrowings by pc mall and its subsidiaries under the pc mall commercial line of credit 
income taxes 
in we recorded a benefit of million for income taxes primarily as a result of our reassessment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets as being more likely than not  resulting in the release of the full amount of our million valuation allowance 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our generating sufficient taxable income in the future 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
this compares with a tax provision in of  for state franchise taxes 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million

 selected operating data unaudited total customers active customers new customers number of orders average order value advertising expense total customers has been calculated as the cumulative number of customers for which orders have been taken from our inception to the end of the reported period 
active customers consist of the number of customers who placed orders during the months prior to the end of the reported period 
new customers represent the number of persons that established a new account and placed an order during the reported period 
number of orders represents the total number of orders shipped during the reported period not reflecting returns 
average order value has been calculated as gross sales divided by the total number of orders during the period presented 
the impact of returns is not reflected in average order value 
advertising expense includes the total dollars spent on advertising during the reported period  including internet  direct mail  print and e mail advertising  as well as customer list enhancement services 

table of contents during the first half of  we focused our attention on completing the implementation of our alternative buying formats and  to a lesser extent  promotion of our website 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we began focusing on introducing new product categories and actively promoting our website 
these promotional efforts in the fourth quarter of included the issuance of mail in rebates and reduced shipping rates charged to customers  as well as increased advertising spending 
we continued the reduced shipping rate promotion and the increased advertising spending in our efforts resulted in an acceleration of our quarterly sequential sales growth rate as we increased our customer base  but contributed to a decline in our reported operating income 
also contributing to this growth in sales was an increase in the number of relationship managers for business customers and purchases by business customers 
our business customer relationship manager headcount increased from in the second quarter of to in  and our business sales to accounts with assigned relationship managers increased during this period 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we experienced significant growth in digital media  home electronics  wireless networking and storage products  which generally had lower average selling prices than our historical levels and resulted in a reduction of our average order value 
we believe there is a moderate level of seasonality in our business  reflecting a combination of fluctuations in online commerce and traditional retail seasonality patterns 
further  sales in the traditional retail industry are generally higher in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 
however  we believe our historical revenue growth makes it difficult to predict the effect of seasonality on our future quarterly revenues and results of operations 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales experienced moderate fluctuations for the eight quarters presented due to changes in product mix and vendor support 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased in the fourth quarter of and primarily as a result of increased promotions designed to attract new customers and encourage repeat purchases from existing customers 
in the third quarter of  sg a expenses increased substantially as a percentage of sales due to non cash stock based compensation expense and certain non recurring charges 
we expect to incur an increase in sg a expenses in future periods as a result of becoming a stand alone publicly traded company 
these expenses as a percentage of net sales will vary depending on the level of revenue obtained 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of financing have come from cash flow from operations and loans from pc mall 
in september  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  which yielded net proceeds of million after underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in april  pc mall agreed to extend a line of credit to us of up to million for necessary working capital requirements  which obligation terminated upon completion of our initial public offering 
prior to the initial public offering  we participated in pc mall s cash management program  whereby our trade cash receipts were handled by pc mall and swept daily from our account 
such cash was readvanced by pc mall for our working capital needs 
accordingly  we have reported no cash or cash equivalents at december  and as of december   we maintain our own cash accounts and receive substantially all trade receivables into such accounts 
in  pc mall made a capital contribution of million to us  which we used to repay the cumulative advances to us from pc mall of million outstanding at that time 
in accordance with pc mall s cash management program  the balance of million was returned to pc mall  and we have recorded a capital contribution due from pc mall reflecting this amount 
in connection with our initial public offering  we paid a dividend of million to pc mall through a settlement of the capital contribution due from pc mall outstanding at the completion of our initial public offering 

table of contents the following table sets forth elements of our cash flows for the periods indicated dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities accounts receivable  which included trade receivables in and trade and credit card receivables in  were million  respectively 
although sales on open account with credit terms increased over these years  accounts receivable from to remained flat 
this was primarily due to credit cards billed but not yet received balances being included in accounts receivable in but included in cash in  since we now maintain our own cash accounts  as described above 
inventories which represent inventory already shipped from our suppliers  but not yet received by customers  increased to million at december  from million in december  caused by the increase in net sales around the december month end period 
as of december   we had million of working capital  primarily as a result of our receipt of net proceeds in the amount of million from our initial public offering 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million which may be available to offset future taxable income and will expire in approximately to years 
during tax years in which we are a member of pc mall s consolidated group for the entire tax year  net operating loss carryforwards may be utilized on pc mall s consolidated return 
if we cease to be a member of pc mall s consolidated group for us federal income tax purposes  available net operating loss carryforwards will first be utilized on pc mall s consolidated return for that year  and only the amount of net operating loss carryforwards not used by pc mall s consolidated group in that year will be available for us in subsequent taxable years 
our ability to use these net operating loss carryforwards to offset any future taxable income depends on a variety of factors 
prior to september   we  along with other subsidiaries of pc mall  were a co borrower under pc mall s million asset based commercial line of credit 
the pc mall commercial line of credit is secured by substantially all of the assets of pc mall and its subsidiaries 
effective upon the completion of our initial public offering we were released from all obligations under the pc mall commercial line of credit and our assets and our outstanding common stock were released as collateral 
we have an asset based line of credit of up to l million with a financial institution  which is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit facility functions as a working capital line of credit with our borrowing under the facility limited to a percentage of our inventory and accounts receivable 
outstanding amounts under the facility bear interest initially at the prime rate plus 
beginning in  outstanding amounts under the facility will bear interest at rates ranging from the prime rate to the prime rate plus  depending on our financial results 
at december   the prime rate was 
in connection with the line of credit  we entered into a cash management arrangement whereby our operating accounts are swept and used to repay outstanding amounts under the line of credit 
the credit facility contains standard terms and conditions customarily found in similar facilities offered to similarly situated borrowers 
the credit facility limits our ability to make acquisitions above pre defined dollar thresholds  requires us to use the proceeds from any future stock issuances to repay outstanding amounts under the facility  and has as its sole financial covenant a minimum tangible net worth requirement 
borrowing availability is subject to satisfaction of certain standard conditions 
fees under the credit facility include an upfront cash fee  an annual unused line fee of of the unused portion of the line and a termination fee ranging from to depending on the timing of any termination of the facility 
the credit facility will mature in march as of december   we had no borrowings under our asset based line of credit 
we currently estimate that we will incur incremental additional operating expenses as a result of becoming a stand alone public company 
these costs include certain administrative costs for services currently performed for us by pc mall  as well as other incremental costs we will incur  including increased legal and accounting expenses  increased personnel and employee benefit costs  investor relations costs  non employee director costs and higher insurance premiums 
after our spin off from pc mall  we expect that we will have additional costs for software and systems to the extent they are not available on terms as favorable as those we receive as a subsidiary of pc mall 
pc mall currently provides us with our inventory management and order fulfillment capabilities and will continue to provide these services until the spin off 
in january  we signed a lease for our own distribution facility located 
table of contents near the fedex main hub in memphis  tennessee and are currently building out the facility 
we expect this new facility to be operational by early april we also estimate that we will need to spend approximately million in capital expenditures through to establish ourselves as an independent company 
these expenditures will include warehouse and distribution equipment  additional hardware and software for our computer systems and furniture and fixtures 
we believe that current working capital  together with cash flows from operations  borrowings available under our credit facility  current cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate to support our current operating plans for at least the next months 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december l  in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases amounts shown under operating leases in the above table consist of base rent under our current sublease with pc mall 
under the sublease with pc mall  we also pay pc mall additional rent for our proportionate share of common area maintenance  including amortization of leasehold improvements  real estate taxes  telecommunications and networking expenses and other operating expenses 
in and  we paid pc mall approximately  and  for these expenses 
after our initial public offering  our use of telecommunications systems and hardware and software systems  which were previously included in this additional rent charge  are provided under a separate agreement with pc mall 
we entered into agreements with pc mall  which provide for  among other things  administrative services  office space  inventory management and order fulfillment  information systems operation and administration  employee benefits  intellectual property matters  and other ongoing relationships 
pc mall provides us with information systems usage of telecommunications systems and hardware and software systems and information technology services  and related support services under an agreement with a term of two years  which we may terminate with six months prior notice 
the administrative services agreement has a term of one year and is terminable by us upon days notice 
in march  the administrative services agreement was amended to reduce the scope of services covered by the agreement and reduce the monthly charge for such services  effective as of the date of the spin off 
our inventory management and order fulfillment agreement has a term ending upon the earlier to occur of the date of the spin off or the first anniversary of the agreement and may be terminated by either party upon days prior notice 
our aggregate fixed payment obligations to pc mall under these agreements for the months assuming no earlier termination by either party following the execution of these agreements is million 
this amount does not include charges for our proportionate share of common area maintenance under our sublease with pc mall or our use of telecommunications and systems and hardware and software systems 
the agreements also provide for certain transaction based fees for fulfillment and shipping which is currently outsourced to pc mall 
on january   we entered into a lease with teachers insurance and annuity association of america for approximately  of rentable square feet in a facility located in memphis  tennessee  in order to provide our own inventory management and order fulfillment operations which are currently provided by pc mall 
the initial term of the lease is months 
upon the expiration of the initial term  we have an option to renew the lease for a period of years 
the renewal option will be subject to all of the terms and conditions contained in the lease  except that the rent during the renewal term will be determined on the basis of the market rent  as such term is defined in the lease 
the equipment installation and office space configuration are currently under construction 
the landlord has provided us with a construction allowance of  under the terms of the lease agreement  our initial monthly base rent is  per month  which will increase periodically over the term of the lease to  if we satisfy all of the initial terms and conditions of the lease  we are not required to pay the monthly base rent for the first two months of the lease 
the total minimum rental amount under the lease is approximately 
table of contents million for the initial term 
in addition to the monthly base rent  we are required to pay for all of our utilities and operating costs based on our proportionate share of all of the operating costs for the premises  but in no event will such costs increase by more than per year in the aggregate over the lease term 
upon execution of the lease in january  we provided the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of  to secure our payment obligations under the lease 
we are required to keep the letter of credit in effect or replace it with a letter of credit with the same terms until days after the expiration of the term of the lease 
the amount of the letter of credit will be reduced periodically over the term of the lease 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results  and we do not expect it to have such an impact in the near future 
there can be no assurances  however  that our business will not be so affected by inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements share based payments in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our statements of operations 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and we are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the new statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in different accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options issued 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the effective date of the new standard for our financial statements is the third fiscal quarter in upon adoption  this statement will have a significant impact on our financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants rather than disclose the impact on our net income within its footnotes see above  as is our current practice 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon adoption of fas r 
compensation expense calculated under fas r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
in addition  upon adoption of fas r we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to the risks of fluctuating interest rates on our line of credit 
if the variable rate on the line of credit changes  we may be required to pay more interest 
we believe that the effect of any change in interest rates 
table of contents will not be material to our financial position 
as of december   we had no borrowings under our line of credit 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  we do not have significant overall currency exposure at december
