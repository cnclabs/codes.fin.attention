executive overview our diluted earnings per share were for  a increase compared with return on average tangible shareholders equity was and return on average shareholders equity was 
our results in reflected strong growth in trading and principal investments  asset management and securities services  and investment banking 
the increase in trading and return on average tangible shareholders equity is computed by dividing net earnings by average monthly tangible shareholders equity 
see results of operations included below for further information regarding our calculation of return on average tangible shareholders equity 

table of contents principal investments reflected significantly higher net revenues in fixed income  currency and commodities ficc  as all major businesses and regions performed well in a generally favorable environment 
net revenues in our principal investments business also increased significantly  due to an unrealized gain on our investment in the convertible preferred stock of sumitomo mitsui financial group  inc smfg  as well as gains from other corporate principal investments 
in addition  equities net revenues improved  primarily reflecting higher customer driven activity and favorable market conditions early in  but results remained below the peak levels achieved in and equities operated in a less favorable environment after our first fiscal quarter of  as volatility levels continued to decline and markets generally lacked direction before moving higher in the last several weeks of our fiscal year 
asset management and securities services generated strong net revenue growth  primarily reflecting higher average assets under management  increased incentive fees and significantly higher customer balances in securities services 
in investment banking  net revenues increased for the first time in three years  highlighted by strong growth in our financial advisory and equity underwriting businesses  primarily reflecting an increase in industry wide corporate activity 
our investment banking backlog at the end of was higher than at the end of our operating results in reflected improvement in the economic environment as well as a number of trends that have emerged in recent years 
we continued to see increased trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves in and  consequently  we increased our market risk during the year to capitalize on these opportunities 
our investment banking results reflected our best performance in three years as corporate activity began to recover  although competitive pressures remained 
in our equities business  although our results were higher compared with as customer driven activity improved  commission rates continued to decline and demands for us to commit capital remained significant 
in the regulatory environment  financial services firms continued to be under intense scrutiny  with the scope of such scrutiny unabated in the last year 
consequently  the volume and amount of claims against financial institutions and other related costs remained significant in given the range of litigation and investigations presently under way  our litigation expenses can be expected to remain high 
though our operating results were strong in  our business  by its nature  does not produce predictable earnings 
our results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets and economic conditions generally

business environment as an investment banking  securities and investment management firm  our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally  both in the united states and elsewhere around the world 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by low inflation  low and declining interest rates  and strong equity markets 
over the business cycle  these factors provide a positive climate for our investment banking activities  for many of our trading businesses and for wealth creation  which contributes to growth in our asset management business 
although geopolitical uncertainty continued and inflation was slightly higher  interest rates  although rising  remained low  merger activity improved  and global equity prices  although spending much of the year in a fairly narrow range  generally increased

a further discussion of the business environment in is set forth below 
global 
after improving during the second half of  growth in the global economy continued to improve during  with worldwide real gross domestic product in the calendar year growing at one of its highest rates in the last twenty years 
the pace of growth was particularly strong in the first half of  but slowed throughout the remainder of the year 
the japanese economy grew very strongly early in but slowed significantly after the first quarter 
after rising early in our fiscal year  global equity markets spent much of the year in a fairly narrow range  but many of the major markets rallied beginning in late october  leading to solid gains over the year 
although the us federal reserve began to raise its federal funds rate target in june  fixed income markets generally performed well  as long term bond yields ended the year close to  or below the levels at the beginning of the year  and corporate credit spreads remained tight 
in the currency markets  the us dollar weakened further against the major currencies  though the weakening was generally smaller than in and occurred largely at the end of our fiscal year 
corporate activity  as measured by industry wide completed and announced mergers and acquisitions as well as equity underwriting volumes  increased significantly during the year  reflecting the continued economic recovery and strengthening equity markets 
in addition  industry wide debt origination volumes remained strong 
united states 
the us economy grew at a strong pace during the year 
real gross domestic product in the calendar year rose by approximately 
although quarterly growth fell from the very high level seen in the third quarter of  it remained strong throughout the year 
a brief softening in consumer spending led to a decline in quarterly real gross domestic product growth during the second calendar quarter  but the pace of economic growth appears to have accelerated again in subsequent quarters 
strong economic and productivity growth contributed to strong corporate profit growth during the year 
inflation increased throughout the year 
in response to the improving environment and rising inflation  the us federal reserve raised the federal funds rate target by basis points in june  and subsequently raised rates a further basis points by the end of our fiscal year to 
despite rising short term interest rates  long term yields moved higher only briefly  for several months around midyear  and ended the year close to levels at the beginning of the year 
with the us dollar weakening further  financial conditions remained supportive of economic activity 
the dow jones industrial average  the s p index and the nasdaq composite index increased  and  respectively  during our fiscal year 
europe 
economic conditions improved in europe during real gross domestic product growth in the eurozone economies rose to approximately in the calendar year  a significant improvement from the previous two years  as domestic demand rose and export performance improved 
growth in the eurozone economies appears to have been stronger in the first half of the year than the second half of the year  as consumer spending slowed from the strong first quarter  and the strengthening euro  in part  restrained economic activity later in the year 
the european central bank left interest rates unchanged through the year  but long term bond yields fell significantly in response to signs of softer economic activity and the sharp rise in the euro in late the uk economy recorded strong growth in  though real gross domestic product growth slowed significantly during the third quarter 
after starting to raise interest rates in november  the bank of england raised interest rates during by basis points 
the ftse index increased during our fiscal year 
asia 
japan s economy grew very strongly in early  though the pace of growth slowed significantly after the first calendar quarter  as investment spending and export growth slowed 
despite slowing after the first quarter  consumer spending growth remained strong through much of and corporate profitability continued to improve 
the bank of japan continued to provide substantial liquidity to the market and continued to hold short term interest rates at zero percent through the year 
the ministry of finance ceased intervention to support the japanese yen in march and the yen remained generally strong 
bond yields rose significantly in the middle of 
table of contents the year but subsequently declined in line with global trends  while the nikkei index increased during our fiscal year 
growth in other asian economies remained very strong in  reflecting strong global demand growth  though the pace of economic growth appears to have peaked in many economies around the middle of the year 
china s growth generally remained firm  though the pace of growth slowed in the middle of the year  as administrative measures to slow certain parts of the economy had a dampening effect on investment spending 
inflation generally rose throughout the year and  in october  the central bank of china increased interest rates for the first time since july  raising its benchmark lending rate by basis points 
certain factors that may affect our business we face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses  including market  credit  liquidity  operational  legal and regulatory risks 
for a discussion of how management seeks to manage some of these risks  see risk management included below 
a summary of some of the important factors that could affect our business follows below 
for a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect our business  see business certain factors that may affect our business in part i  item of the annual report on form k 
market conditions and market risk 
our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally 
business conditions continued to improve in  after improving somewhat during the second half of the number and size of equity underwritings and completed mergers and acquisitions transactions increased significantly in  after declining for three straight years  and fixed income origination levels remained strong  fixed income market conditions remained generally favorable  as interest rates  although rising  remained low by historical standards  and corporate credit spreads remained narrow  and in the global equity markets  although volatility levels and commission rates continued to decline  price levels and volumes were generally stronger 
adverse or uncertain economic and market conditions have in the past adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect  our business and profitability in many ways  including the following we have been operating in a low interest rate market for the past several years 
increasing or high interest rates and or widening credit spreads  especially if such changes are rapid  may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses 
we have been committing increasing amounts of capital in many of our businesses and generally maintain large trading  specialist and investment positions 
market fluctuations and volatility may adversely affect the value of those positions or may reduce our willingness to enter into new transactions 
conversely  our trading businesses depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities  and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these businesses 
industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions and increased price competition may have an adverse effect on our revenues and  because we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly  our profit margins 
in particular  because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues are derived from our participation in large transactions  a decrease in the number of large transactions due to uncertain or unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our investment banking business 
reductions in the level of the equity markets also tend to reduce the value of our clients portfolios  which in turn may reduce the fees we earn for managing assets 
even in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable economic or market conditions  investment performance by our asset management business below the performance of benchmarks or competitors 
table of contents could result in a decline in assets under management and  therefore  in the incentive and management fees we receive 
concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market making  proprietary trading  block trading  merchant banking  underwriting and lending businesses 
this risk may increase to the extent we expand our proprietary trading businesses or commit capital to facilitate primarily client driven business 
for example  large blocks of stock are increasingly being sold in block trades rather than on a marketed basis  which increases the risk goldman sachs may be unable to resell the purchased securities at favorable prices 
moreover  because of concentration of risk  we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry 
we also regularly enter into large transactions as part of our trading businesses 
the number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period 
the volume of transactions that we execute for our customers and as a specialist may decline  which would reduce the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads 
in our specialist businesses  we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market  including by purchasing shares in a declining market 
this may result in trading losses and an increased need for liquidity 
weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our trading businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
for a further discussion of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  see critical accounting policies goodwill and identifiable intangible assets included below 
if any of the variety of instruments  processes and strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective  we may incur losses 
our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk 
credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets will not perform their obligations 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances 
the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years  as has the breadth of the entities to which we have credit exposure 
as a clearing member firm  we finance our customer positions and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers 
in addition  we have experienced  due to competitive factors  pressure to extend credit and price more aggressively the credit risks we take 
in particular  corporate clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in connection with investment banking and other assignments 
although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries  countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee 
in addition  concerns about  or a default by  one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions  which in turn could adversely affect goldman sachs 
liquidity risk 
liquidity is essential to our businesses 
our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access secured and or unsecured debt markets  an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or an inability to sell assets 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time 
our credit ratings are important to our liquidity 
a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position  increase our borrowing costs  limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts 
under such provisions  counterparties could be permitted to 
table of contents terminate contracts with goldman sachs or require us to post additional collateral 
termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements 
for a discussion of the potential impact on goldman sachs of a reduction in our credit ratings  see capital and funding credit ratings included below 
operational risk 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies  and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems could lead to  among other consequences  financial loss and reputational damage 
in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by goldman sachs or third parties with which we conduct business 
legal and regulatory risk 
substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against goldman sachs could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to goldman sachs  which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects 
firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment 
we face significant legal risks in our businesses  and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have been increasing 
for a discussion of how we account for our legal and regulatory exposures  see use of estimates included below 
critical accounting policies fair value total financial instruments owned  at fair value and financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition consist of financial instruments carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in our results of operations 
the use of fair value to measure these financial instruments  with related unrealized gains and losses recognized immediately in our results of operations  is fundamental to our financial statements and is our most critical accounting policy 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 

table of contents in determining fair value  we separate our financial instruments into three categories cash ie  nonderivative trading instruments  derivative contracts and principal investments  as set forth in the following table financial instruments by category in millions as of november financial financial financial instruments sold  financial instruments sold  instruments but not yet instruments but not yet owned  at purchased  at owned  at purchased  at fair value fair value fair value fair value cash trading instruments derivative contracts principal investments total excludes assets of billion and billion in consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds as of november and november  respectively 
cash trading instruments 
fair values of our cash trading instruments are generally obtained from quoted market prices in active markets  broker or dealer price quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued in this manner include us government and agency securities  other sovereign government obligations  liquid mortgage products  investment grade corporate bonds  listed equities  money market securities  state  municipal and provincial obligations  and physical commodities 
certain cash trading instruments trade infrequently and  therefore  have little or no price transparency 
such instruments may include certain high yield debt  corporate bank loans  mortgage whole loans and distressed debt 
we value these instruments using methodologies such as the present value of known or estimated cash flows and generally do not adjust underlying valuation assumptions unless there is substantive evidence supporting a change in the value of the underlying instrument or valuation assumptions such as similar market transactions  changes in financial ratios and changes in credit ratings of the underlying companies 

table of contents the following table sets forth the valuation of our cash trading instruments by level of price transparency cash trading instruments by price transparency in millions as of november financial financial financial instruments sold  financial instruments sold  instruments but not yet instruments but not yet owned  at purchased  at owned  at purchased  at fair value fair value fair value fair value quoted prices or alternative pricing sources with reasonable price transparency little or no price transparency total cash trading instruments we own long positions are marked to bid prices and instruments we have sold but not yet purchased short positions are marked to offer prices 
if liquidating a position is reasonably expected to affect its prevailing market price  our valuation is adjusted generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies 
in certain circumstances  such as for highly illiquid positions  management s estimates are used to determine this adjustment 
derivative contracts 
derivative contracts consist of exchange traded and over the counter otc derivatives 
the following table sets forth the fair value of our exchange traded and otc derivative assets and liabilities derivative assets and liabilities in millions as of november assets liabilities assets liabilities exchange traded derivatives otc derivatives total the fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities include cash we have paid and received for example  option premiums or cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and may change significantly from period to period based on  among other factors  changes in our trading positions and market movements 

table of contents fair values of our exchange traded derivatives are generally determined from quoted market prices 
otc derivatives are valued using valuation models 
we use a variety of valuation models including the present value of known or estimated cash flows  option pricing models and option adjusted spread models 
the valuation models that we use to derive the fair values of our otc derivatives require inputs including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs 
the selection of a model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we generally use similar models to value similar instruments 
where possible  we verify the values produced by our pricing models to market transactions 
for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets  such as generic forwards  swaps and options  model selection does not involve significant judgment because market prices are readily available 
for otc derivatives that trade in less liquid markets  model selection requires more judgment because such instruments tend to be more complex and pricing information is less available in the market 
as markets continue to develop and more pricing information becomes available  we continue to review and refine the models that we use 
at the inception of an otc derivative contract day one  we value the contract at the model value if we can verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions 
when appropriate  valuations are adjusted to reflect various factors such as liquidity  bid offer and credit considerations 
these adjustments are generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies 
in certain circumstances  such as for highly illiquid positions  management s estimates are used to determine these adjustments 
where we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions  we value the contract at the transaction price at inception and  consequently  record no day one gain or loss in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
following day one  we adjust the inputs to our valuation models only to the extent that changes in such inputs can be verified by similar market transactions  third party pricing services and or broker quotes or can be derived from other substantive evidence such as empirical market data 
in circumstances where we cannot verify the model to market transactions  it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value 

table of contents the following tables set forth the fair values of our otc derivative assets and liabilities by product and by remaining contractual maturity otc derivatives in millions as of november assets years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total liabilities years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total as of november assets years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total liabilities years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total we enter into certain otc option transactions that provide us or our counterparties with the right to extend the maturity of the underlying contract 
the fair value of these option contracts is not material to the aggregate fair value of our otc derivative portfolio 
in the tables above  for option contracts that require settlement by delivery of an underlying derivative instrument  the classification of the remaining contractual maturity is generally based upon the maturity date of the underlying derivative instrument 
in those instances when the underlying instrument does not have a maturity date or either counterparty has the right to settle in cash  the remaining contractual maturity date is generally based upon the option expiration date 

table of contents price transparency for otc derivative model inputs varies depending on  among other factors  product type  maturity and the complexity of the contract 
price transparency for interest rate and currency contracts varies by the underlying currencies  with the currencies of the leading industrialized nations having the most price transparency 
price transparency for commodity contracts varies by type of underlying commodity 
price transparency for equity contracts varies by market  with the equity markets of the leading industrialized nations having the most price transparency 
price transparency is inherently more limited for more complex structures because they often combine one or more product types  requiring additional inputs such as correlations and volatilities 
principal investments 
in valuing our corporate and real estate principal investments  we separate our portfolio into investments in private companies  investments in public companies excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg and our investment in smfg 
the following table sets forth the carrying value of our principal investments portfolio principal investments in millions as of november corporate real estate total corporate real estate total private public subtotal smfg convertible preferred stock total the fair value of our japanese yen denominated investment in smfg convertible preferred stock includes the effect of foreign exchange revaluation 
we hedge our economic exposure to exchange rate movements on our investment in smfg by borrowing japanese yen 
foreign exchange revaluation on the investment and the related borrowing are generally equal and offsetting 
for example  if the japanese yen appreciates against the us dollar  the us dollar carrying value of our smfg investment will increase and the us dollar carrying value of the related borrowing will also increase by an amount that is generally equal and offsetting 
excludes assets of billion and billion in consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds as of november and november  respectively 
our private principal investments  by their nature  have little or no price transparency 
such investments are initially carried at cost as an approximation of fair value 
adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
downward adjustments are also made  in the absence of third party transactions  if we determine that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value 
in reaching that determination  we consider many factors including  but not limited to  the operating cash flows and financial performance of the companies or properties relative to budgets or projections  trends within sectors and or regions  underlying business models  expected exit timing and strategy  and any specific rights or terms associated with the investment  such as conversion features and liquidation preferences 
our public principal investments  which tend to be large  concentrated holdings that result from initial public offerings or other corporate transactions  are valued using quoted market prices discounted for restrictions on sale 
if liquidating a position is reasonably expected to affect market prices  valuations are adjusted accordingly based on predetermined written policies 

table of contents our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg is carried at fair value  which is derived from a model that incorporates smfg s common stock price and credit spreads  the impact of nontransferability and illiquidity and the downside protection on the conversion strike price 
the fair value of our investment is particularly sensitive to movements in the smfg common stock price 
as a result of transfer restrictions and the downside protection on the conversion strike price  the relationship between changes in the fair value of our investment and changes in smfg s common stock price is nonlinear 
during the fiscal year  the fair value of our investment increased expressed in japanese yen  primarily due to an increase in the smfg common stock price and the passage of time in respect of the transfer restrictions on the underlying common stock 
goldman sachs has the right to convert our preferred stock investment in smfg into shares of smfg common stock beginning on february  the current conversion price is  but this price is subject to downward adjustment if the price of smfg common stock at the time of conversion is less than the conversion price subject to a floor of 
our convertible preferred investment is generally nontransferable 
one third of the underlying shares of smfg common stock will become transferable on february   with the remaining shares of common stock becoming transferable in equal installments on february  and february  in addition  restrictions on our ability to hedge the underlying common stock will lapse in three equal annual installments beginning on february  controls over valuation of financial instruments 
proper controls  independent of the trading and principal investing functions  are fundamental to ensuring that our financial instruments are appropriately and consistently valued and that fair value measurements are reliable 
this is particularly important in valuing instruments with lower levels of price transparency 
we employ an oversight structure that includes appropriate segregation of duties 
senior management  independent of the trading functions  is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and procedures and reporting the results of such work to the audit committee 
we seek to maintain the necessary resources  with the appropriate experience and training  to ensure that control and independent price verification functions are performed to the highest standards 
in addition  we employ procedures for the approval of new transaction types and markets  independent price verification  review of daily profit and loss  and review of valuation models by personnel with appropriate technical knowledge of relevant products and markets 
for a further discussion of how we manage the risks inherent in our trading and principal investing businesses  see risk management included below 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as a result of our business combinations  principally with slk llc slk in fiscal  we have acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  at the acquisition date 
goodwill 
we test the goodwill in each of our operating segments for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the estimated fair value of each operating segment with its estimated net book value 
we derive the fair value of each of our operating segments primarily based on price earnings multiples 
we derive the net book value of our operating segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the assets of each operating segment 
our last annual impairment test was performed during our fiscal fourth quarter and no impairment was identified 

table of contents the following table sets forth the carrying value of our goodwill by operating segment goodwill by operating segment in millions as of november investment banking financial advisory underwriting trading and principal investments ficc equities principal investments asset management and securities services asset management securities services total primarily related to our combinations with slk and the hull group 
primarily related to our combination with the ayco company  lp ayco 
identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives in accordance with sfas no 
 and test for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an impairment loss  calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 
during the fiscal fourth quarter of  the american stock exchange  the chicago board options exchange and the philadelphia stock exchange all announced proposed restructuring plans and continued to experience loss of market share to the international securities exchange  which became the leading us options exchange during consequently  we tested our related option specialist rights for impairment during the fourth quarter of  and recognized an impairment charge of million 
the estimated fair value of the option specialist rights was derived from estimated discounted cash flows 
we also surrendered certain option specialist rights in earlier quarters of  recognizing total charges of million 
there were no intangible asset impairments in fiscal 
table of contents the following table sets forth the carrying value and range of remaining useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets by major asset class identifiable intangible assets by asset class in millions as of november range of remaining carrying useful lives carrying value in years value customer lists new york stock exchange nyse specialist rights exchange traded fund etf and option specialist rights other total primarily includes our clearance and execution and nasdaq customer lists acquired in our combination with slk and financial counseling customer lists acquired in our combination with ayco 
primarily includes technology related assets acquired in our combination with slk 
a prolonged period of weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and or identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  an announced restructuring by the nyse or any other exchange on which we hold specialist rights or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator could indicate a potential impairment of the associated identifiable intangible assets 
use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation matters  particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred

tangible shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
we believe that return on average tangible shareholders equity is a meaningful measure of performance because it excludes the portion of our shareholders equity attributable to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
as a result  this calculation measures corporate performance in a manner that treats underlying businesses consistently  whether they were acquired or developed internally

off balance sheet arrangements we have various types of off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business 
our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms  including purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in mortgage backed and asset backed securitization vehicles  holding senior and subordinated debt  limited and general partnership interests  and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles  entering into interest rate  foreign currency  equity  commodity and credit derivatives  entering into operating leases  and providing guarantees  indemnifications  loan commitments  letters of credit  representations and warranties 
we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes  primarily related to the securitization of commercial and residential mortgages and home equity loans  government and corporate bonds  and other types of financial assets 
other reasons for entering into these arrangements include underwriting client securitization transactions  providing secondary market liquidity  making investments in performing and nonperforming debt  real estate and other assets  providing investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes  and receiving or providing letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process 
variable interest entities vies and qualifying special purpose entities qspes are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets  including the mortgage backed and asset backed securities markets  since they provide market liquidity to financial assets by offering investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process 
our financial interests in  and derivative transactions with  nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair value  in the same manner as our other financial instruments  except in cases where we exert significant influence over an entity and apply the equity method of accounting

goldman sachs total capital shareholders equity and long term borrowings increased to billion as of november compared with billion as of november see risk management liquidity risk cash flows included below  for a discussion of how we deployed capital raised as part of our financing activities 
the increase in total capital resulted primarily from an increase in long term borrowings to billion as of november from billion as of november the weighted average maturity of our long term borrowings as of november was approximately years 
we swap a substantial portion of our long term borrowings into us dollar obligations with short term floating interest rates in order to minimize our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange movements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our long term borrowings 
over the past several years  our ratio of long term borrowings to shareholders equity has been increasing 
the growth in our long term borrowings has been driven primarily by i the need to increase total capital in response to opportunities in our trading and investing businesses and ii in light of the favorable debt financing environment  our ability to replace a portion of our short term borrowings with long term borrowings and pre fund near term refinancing requirements

the repurchase program has been effected primarily through regular open market purchases  the sizes of which have been and will continue to be influenced by  among other factors  prevailing prices and market conditions 
the average price paid per share for repurchased shares was and for the years ended november and november  respectively

tangible equity capital includes tangible shareholders equity and junior subordinated debt issued to a trust 
we consider junior subordinated debt issued to a trust to be a component of our tangible equity capital base due to the inherent characteristics of these securities  including the long term nature of the securities  our ability to defer coupon interest for up to ten consecutive semiannual periods and the subordinated nature of the obligations in our capital structure 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of shareholders equity to tangible shareholders equity and tangible equity capital as of november in millions shareholders equity deduct goodwill and identifiable intangible assets tangible shareholders equity add junior subordinated debt issued to a trust tangible equity capital leverage ratio equals total assets divided by shareholders equity 
adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible equity capital 
we believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of our capital adequacy because it excludes certain low risk collateralized assets that are generally supported with little or no capital and reflects the tangible equity capital deployed in our businesses 
debt to equity ratio equals long term borrowings divided by shareholders equity 
book value per share is based on common shares outstanding  including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements  of million as of november and million as of november tangible book value per share is computed by dividing tangible shareholders equity by the number of common shares outstanding  including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements

our commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to counterparties that have fixed termination dates and are contingent on all conditions to borrowing set forth in the contract having been met 
since these commitments may expire unused  the total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow requirements 
as of november  billion of our outstanding commitments to extend credit have been issued through the william street credit extension program 
substantially all of the credit risk associated with these commitments has been covered by credit loss protection provided by smfg 
we have also hedged the credit risk of certain non william street commitments using a variety of other financial instruments

the financial groups directive directive ec of the european parliament and of the council introduced certain changes to the way in which financial conglomerates and other financial services organizations operating in europe will be regulated  with the changes to be implemented by member states for fiscal years beginning in these changes will cause activities that are currently conducted in unregulated entities to become subject to certain forms of regulation  including consolidated supervision and capital adequacy requirements 
our efforts to comply with the directive involve applying to be subject to the consolidated supervised entity rules described below 
the sec has adopted rule amendments that establish alternative net capital requirements for broker dealers that are part of a consolidated supervised entity 
as a condition to its use of the alternative method  a broker dealer s ultimate holding company and affiliates referred to collectively as a consolidated supervised entity or cse must consent to group wide supervision and examination by the sec 
goldman  sachs co 
anticipates applying for permission to use this alternative method 
we expect that doing so will enable us to comply with the requirements of the financial groups directive described above 
on becoming subject to the sec s group wide supervision  goldman sachs will be required to report to the sec computations of our capital adequacy 
risk management management believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of goldman sachs 
accordingly  we have a comprehensive risk management process to monitor  evaluate and manage the principal risks we assume in conducting our activities 
these risks include market  credit  liquidity  operational  legal and reputational exposures 
risk management structure goldman sachs seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial  credit  operational and legal reporting systems 
in addition  a number of committees are responsible for monitoring risk exposures and for general oversight of our risk management process 
these committees  whose responsibilities are described below  meet regularly and consist of senior members of both our revenue producing units and departments that are independent of our revenue producing units 
management committee 
all risk control functions ultimately report to our management committee 
through both direct and delegated authority  the management committee approves all of our operating activities  trading risk parameters and customer review guidelines 
risk committees 
the firmwide risk committee reviews the activities of existing businesses  approves new businesses and products  approves firmwide and divisional market risk limits  reviews business unit market risk limits  approves market risk limits for selected emerging markets and business units  approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit risk limits by ratings group  and reviews scenario analyses based on abnormal or catastrophic market movements 
the divisional risk committee sets market risk limits  subject to overall firmwide risk limits  for both ficc and equities based on a number of measures  including value at risk var and scenario analyses 
in our asset management business  the control oversight committee  the investment policy group and the valuation committee oversee various operational  credit  valuation and business practice issues 
business practices committee 
the business practices committee assists senior management in its oversight of compliance and operational risks and related reputational concerns 
the committee also reviews the firm s policies  practices and procedures for consistency with our 
table of contents business principles 
the committee makes recommendations for improvements in these areas so as to mitigate potential risks and to assist in enhancing adherence to our business principles 
capital committee 
the capital committee reviews and approves transactions involving commitments of our capital 
such capital commitments include extensions of credit  alternative liquidity commitments  certain bond underwritings  certain distressed debt and principal finance activities and certain equity linked structured products 
the capital committee is also responsible for ensuring that business and reputational standards for capital commitments are maintained on a global basis 
commitments committee 
the commitments committee reviews and approves underwriting and distribution activities and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal  reputational  regulatory and business standards are maintained in conjunction with these activities 
in addition to reviewing specific transactions  the commitments committee periodically conducts strategic reviews of industry sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices 
credit policy committee 
the credit policy committee establishes and reviews broad credit policies and parameters that are implemented by the credit department 
finance committee 
the finance committee establishes and ensures compliance with our liquidity policies  sets certain inventory position limits and has oversight responsibility for liquidity risk  the size and composition of our balance sheet  our capital base and our credit ratings 
the finance committee regularly reviews our funding position and capitalization and makes adjustments in light of current events  risks and exposures 
operational risk committee 
the operational risk committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies  framework and methodologies  and monitors the effectiveness of operational risk management 
structured products committee 
the structured products committee reviews and approves structured product transactions with our clients that raise legal  regulatory  tax or accounting issues or present reputational risk to goldman sachs 
segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental elements of our risk management process 
in addition to the committees described above  departments that are independent of the revenue producing units  such as compliance  finance  legal  management controls internal audit and operations  in part perform risk management functions  which include monitoring  analyzing and evaluating risk 
business unit risk limits are established by the various risk committees and may be further allocated by the business unit managers to individual trading desks 
trading desk managers have the first line of responsibility for managing risk within prescribed limits 
these managers have in depth knowledge of the primary sources of risk in their individual markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures 
market risk limits are monitored on a daily basis by the finance division  and are reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee 
limit violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and the appropriate business unit managers 
selected business unit inventory position limits are also monitored by the finance division and position limit violations are reported to the appropriate business unit managers and the finance committee 
market risk the potential for changes in the market value of our trading and investing positions is referred to as market risk 
such positions result from market making  specialist and proprietary trading  investing and underwriting activities 

table of contents categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates  equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices 
a description of each market risk category is set forth below interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes in the level  slope and curvature of the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of currency rates 
commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of commodities  such as electricity  natural gas  crude oil  petroleum products  and precious and base metals 
we seek to manage these risks through diversifying exposures  controlling position sizes and establishing hedges in related securities or derivatives 
for example  we may hedge a portfolio of common stocks by taking an offsetting position in a related equity index futures contract 
the ability to manage an exposure may  however  be limited by adverse changes in the liquidity of the security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation of price movements between the security and related hedge instrument 
in addition to applying business judgment  senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk 
these tools include risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure referred to as var  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equity markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and inventory position limits for selected business units 
var var is the potential loss in value of goldman sachs trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
for the var numbers reported below  a one day time horizon and a confidence level were used 
this means that there is a in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
thus  shortfalls from expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater than the reported var would be anticipated to occur  on average  about once a month 
shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days 
the var numbers below are shown separately for interest rate  equity  currency and commodity products  as well as for our overall trading positions 
the var numbers in each risk category include the underlying product positions and related hedges that may include positions in other product areas 
for example  the hedge of a foreign exchange forward may include an interest rate futures position  and the hedge of a long corporate bond position may include a short position in the related equity 
the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that these assumptions and 
table of contents approximations are reasonable  there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var  and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
we use historical data to estimate our var and  to better reflect current asset volatilities  we generally weight historical data to give greater importance to more recent observations 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
different var methodologies and distributional assumptions could produce a materially different var 
moreover  var calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day 
changes in var between reporting periods are generally due to changes in levels of exposure  volatilities and or correlations among asset classes 
the following tables set forth the daily trading var average daily var in millions year ended november risk categories interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect firmwide during the fourth quarter of  we made certain changes to our model for calculating var 
the effect of these changes was not material and  accordingly  prior periods have not been adjusted 
during the second quarter of  we began to exclude from our calculation distressed asset portfolios in ficc that cannot be properly measured in var

this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher levels of exposure to equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices  partially offset by reduced exposures to interest rates  as well as reduced volatilities  particularly in interest rate and equity assets 
the increase in average daily var to million in from million in was due to higher levels of exposure in all product categories  partially offset by reduced volatilities  particularly in equity assets

trading losses incurred on a single day exceeded our one day var on one occasion during distressed asset portfolios the market risk associated with distressed asset portfolios in ficc that cannot be properly measured in var primarily due to inadequate historical data on the underlying assets in the aggregate is measured based on a potential decline in the asset value of such portfolios 
the market values of the underlying distressed asset positions are sensitive to changes in a number of factors  including discount rates and the projected timing and amount of future cash flows 
as of november  the potential impact of a decline in the asset value of these portfolios was million compared with million as of november nontrading risk smfg 
the market risk of our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg is measured using a sensitivity analysis that estimates the potential reduction in our net revenues associated with a decline in the smfg common stock price 
as of november  the sensitivity of our investment to a decline in the smfg common stock price was million compared with million as of november the change is primarily due to an increase in the smfg common stock price and the passage of time in respect of the transfer restrictions on the underlying common stock 
this sensitivity should not be extrapolated to other movements in the smfg common stock price  as the relationship between the fair value of our investment and the smfg common stock price is nonlinear 

table of contents other principal investments 
the market risk for financial instruments in our nontrading portfolio  including our merchant banking investments but excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg  is measured using a sensitivity analysis that estimates the potential reduction in our net revenues associated with a decline in equity markets 
this sensitivity analysis is based on certain assumptions regarding the relationship between changes in stock price indices and changes in the fair value of the individual financial instruments in our nontrading portfolio 
different assumptions could produce materially different risk estimates 
as of november  the sensitivity of our nontrading portfolio excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg to a equity market decline was million compared with million as of november  primarily reflecting an increase in the carrying value of our public principal investments 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold fails to perform under its contractual obligations to us 
to reduce our credit exposures  we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
in addition  we attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from a counterparty or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events  by seeking third party guarantees of the counterparty s obligations  and through the use of credit derivatives and other structures and techniques 
for most businesses  counterparty credit limits are established by the credit department  which is independent of the revenue producing departments  based on guidelines set by the firmwide risk committee and the credit policy committee 
for most products  we measure and limit credit exposures by reference to both current and potential exposure 
we typically measure potential exposure based on projected worst case market movements over the life of a transaction within a confidence interval 
for collateralized transactions  we also evaluate potential exposure over a shorter collection period  and give effect to the value of collateral received 
we further seek to measure credit exposure through the use of scenario analyses  stress tests and other quantitative tools 
our global credit management systems monitor current and potential credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their affiliates 
the systems also provide management  including the firmwide risk and credit policy committees  with information regarding overall credit risk by product  industry sector  country and region 
as of both november and november  we held us government and federal agency obligations that represented and of our total assets  respectively 
in addition  most of our securities purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized by us government  federal agency and other sovereign obligations 
as of november and november  we did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded of our total assets 
however  over the past several years  the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing  due to  among other factors  the growth of our lending and otc derivatives activities 
a further discussion of our derivative activities follows below 
derivatives derivative contracts are instruments  such as futures  forwards  swaps or option contracts  which derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts  which are often referred to as otc derivatives  or they may be listed and traded on an exchange 
substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered into for trading purposes  in order to facilitate customer transactions  to take proprietary positions or as a means of risk management 
in addition to derivative transactions entered into for trading purposes  we enter into derivative contracts 
table of contents to hedge our net investment in non us operations and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure on our long term borrowings and certain short term borrowings 
derivatives are used in many of our businesses  and we believe that the associated market risk can only be understood relative to the underlying assets or risks being hedged  or as part of a broader trading strategy 
accordingly  the market risk of derivative positions is managed with all of our other nonderivative market risk 
fair values of our derivative contracts reflect cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and are reported on a net by counterparty basis in our consolidated statements of financial condition when management believes a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement 
for an otc derivative  our credit exposure is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of such contract 
the following table sets forth the distribution  by credit rating  of substantially all of our exposure with respect to otc derivatives as of november  after taking into consideration the effect of netting agreements 
the categories shown reflect our internally determined public rating agency equivalents 
over the counter derivative credit exposure in millions exposure percentage of collateral net of total exposure credit rating equivalent exposure held collateral net of collateral aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa bb ba or lower unrated total reflects cash received pursuant to credit support agreements 

table of contents the following tables set forth our otc derivative credit exposure  net of collateral  by remaining contractual maturity exposure net of collateral in millions years credit rating equivalent months months years years or greater total aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa bb ba or lower unrated total years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total where we have obtained collateral from a counterparty under a master trading agreement that covers multiple products and transactions  we have allocated the collateral ratably based on exposure before giving effect to such collateral 
derivative transactions may also involve legal risks including  among other risks  that they are not authorized or appropriate for a counterparty  that documentation has not been properly executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty 
we attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining advice of counsel on the enforceability of agreements as well as on the authority of a counterparty to effect the derivative transaction 
liquidity risk liquidity is of critical importance to companies in the financial services sector 
most failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances 
accordingly  goldman sachs has in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain significant flexibility to address both firm specific and broader industry or market liquidity events 
our principal objective is to be able to fund goldman sachs and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate revenue even under adverse circumstances 
management has implemented a number of policies according to the following liquidity risk management framework excess liquidity maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows in a stressed environment including financing obligations 
asset liability management ensure we fund our assets with the appropriate financing 
intercompany funding maintain parent company liquidity and manage the distribution of liquidity across the group structure 
crisis planning ensure all funding and liquidity management is based on stress scenario planning and feeds into our liquidity crisis plan 

table of contents excess liquidity maintenance of a pool of highly liquid securities 
our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund what we estimate will be our likely cash needs during a liquidity crisis and hold such excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered  highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity 
this global core excess liquidity is intended to allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets 
we believe that this pre funded pool of excess liquidity provides us with a resilient source of funds and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment 
our global core excess reflects the following principles focus must be maintained on all potential cash outflows  not just disruptions to financing flows 
goldman sachs businesses are diverse  and its cash needs are driven by many factors  including market movements  collateral requirements and client commitments  all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment 
during a liquidity crisis  credit sensitive funding  including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements  may be unavailable and the terms or availability of other types of secured financing may change 
as a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis  we hold more unencumbered securities and larger unsecured debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require 
we believe that the firm s liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities  even though it increases our unsecured liabilities 
the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company s survival 
the loan value the estimated amount of cash that would be advanced by counterparties against these securities of our global core excess averaged billion in and billion in the following table sets forth the average loan value of our global core excess year ended november in millions us dollar denominated non us dollar denominated total global core excess the us dollar denominated excess includes only overnight cash deposits and unencumbered us government and agency securities and highly liquid mortgage securities  all of which are federal reserve repo eligible 
our non us dollar denominated excess includes only unencumbered french  german  united kingdom and japanese government bonds and non us dollar overnight cash deposits 
we strictly limit our global core excess to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash which we believe are highly liquid  even in a difficult funding environment 
the majority of our global core excess is structured such that it is available to meet the liquidity requirements of our parent company  group inc  and all of its subsidiaries 
the remainder is held in our principal non us operating entities  primarily to better match the currency and timing requirements for those entities potential liquidity obligations 
the size of our global core excess is determined by an internal liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and of goldman sachs 
our liquidity 
table of contents model identifies and estimates cash and collateral outflows over a short term horizon in a liquidity crisis  including  but not limited to upcoming maturities of unsecured debt  potential buybacks of a portion of our outstanding negotiable unsecured debt  adverse changes in the terms or availability of secured funding  derivatives and other margin and collateral outflows due to market moves or increased requirements  additional collateral that could be called in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings  draws on our unfunded commitments not supported by william street funding corporation  and upcoming cash outflows  such as tax and other large payments 
other unencumbered assets 
in addition to our global core excess described above  we have a significant amount of other unencumbered securities as a result of our business activities 
these assets  which are located in the united states  europe and asia  include other government bonds  high grade money market securities  corporate bonds and marginable equities 
we do not include these securities in our global core excess 
we maintain global core excess and other unencumbered assets in an amount that  if pledged or sold  would provide the funds necessary to replace at least of our unsecured obligations that are scheduled to mature or where holders have the option to redeem within the next twelve months 
this implies that we could fund our positions on a secured basis for one year in the event we were unable to issue new unsecured debt or liquidate assets 
we assume conservative loan values that are based on stress scenario borrowing capacity and we review these assumptions asset by asset at least annually 
the estimated aggregate loan value of our global core excess and our other unencumbered assets averaged billion in and billion in asset liability management asset quality and balance sheet composition 
we seek to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet and substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily 
our balance sheet fluctuates significantly between financial statement dates and is lower at fiscal period end than would be observed on an average basis 
we require certain of our businesses to reduce balance sheet usage on a quarterly basis to demonstrate compliance with limits set by management  thereby providing a disincentive to committing our capital over longer periods of time 
these balance sheet reductions are generally achieved during the last several weeks of each fiscal quarter through ordinary course  open market transactions in the most liquid portions of our balance sheet  principally us government and agency securities  securities of foreign sovereigns  and mortgage and money market instruments  as well as through the roll off of repurchase agreements and certain collateralized financing arrangements 
accordingly  over the last six quarters  our total assets and adjusted assets at quarter end have been  on average  lower and lower  respectively  than amounts that would have been observed  based on a weekly average  over that period 
these differences  however  have not resulted in material changes to our credit risk  market risk or liquidity position because they are generally in highly liquid assets that are typically financed on a secured basis 
certain financial instruments may be more difficult to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress and  accordingly  we generally hold higher levels of capital for these assets than more liquid types of financial instruments 
the global core excess excludes liquid assets held separately to support the william street credit extension program 

table of contents the table below sets forth our aggregate holdings in these categories of financial instruments as of november in millions mortgage whole loans and collateralized debt obligations bank loans high yield securities emerging market debt securities smfg convertible preferred stock other corporate principal investments real estate principal investments includes certain retained interests held in qspes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our securitization activities 
includes both funded commitments and inventory held in connection with our trading and lending activities 
excludes assets of billion and billion in consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds as of november and november  respectively 
a large proportion of these assets are continually funded on a secured basis through normal secured funding markets and nonrecourse funding 
we focus on developing capacity for funding these assets on a term secured basis in order to ensure that these assets maintain a certain amount of loan value in periods of market stress 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding the financial instruments we hold 
appropriate financing of asset base 
we seek to manage the maturity profile of our funding base such that we should be able to liquidate our assets prior to our liabilities coming due  even in times of prolonged or severe liquidity stress 
we generally do not rely on immediate sales of assets other than our global core excess to maintain liquidity in a distressed environment 
however  we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent and necessary in a persistent liquidity crisis 
in order to avoid reliance on asset sales  we ensure that we have sufficient total capital long term borrowings plus shareholders equity to fund our balance sheet for at least one year 
we therefore seek to maintain total capital in excess of the aggregate of the following long term financing requirements the portion of financial instruments owned that we believe could not be funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress  assuming conservative loan values  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  property  leasehold improvements and equipment  and other illiquid assets  derivatives and other margin and collateral requirements  anticipated draws on our unfunded commitments  and capital or other forms of financing in our regulated subsidiaries that is in excess of their long term financing requirements 
see intercompany funding included below for further discussion on how we fund our subsidiaries 
our total capital of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  exceeded the aggregate of these requirements 

table of contents conservative liability structure 
we structure our liabilities conservatively to minimize refinancing and buy back risk 
for example  we emphasize the use of promissory notes over commercial paper in order to improve the stability of our short term unsecured financing base 
we have also created internal guidelines regarding the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any single week or year and have average maturity targets for our unsecured debt programs 
we seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally for both secured and unsecured funding 
we have imposed various internal guidelines  including the amount of our commercial paper that can be owned and letters of credit that can be issued by any single investor or group of investors 
we benefit from distributing our debt issuances through our own sales force to a large  diverse global creditor base and we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity 
we access funding in a variety of markets in the united states  europe and asia 
we issue debt through syndicated us registered offerings  us registered and a medium term notes programs  offshore medium term notes offerings and other bond offerings  us and us commercial paper and promissory note issuances  and other methods 
we make extensive use of the repurchase agreement and securities lending markets and arrange for letters of credit to be issued on our behalf 
additionally  senior unsecured debt issued by group inc does not contain provisions that would  based solely upon an adverse change in our credit ratings  financial ratios  earnings  cash flows or our stock price  trigger a requirement for an early payment  collateral support  changes in terms  acceleration of maturity or the creation of an additional financial obligation 
intercompany funding subsidiary funding policies 
substantially all of our unsecured funding is raised by our parent company  group inc the parent company then lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries  some of which are regulated  to meet their asset financing and capital requirements 
in addition  the parent company provides its regulated subsidiaries the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements 
the benefits of this strategy include enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries 
our intercompany funding policies are predicated on our assumption that  unless legally provided for  funds or securities are not freely available from a subsidiary to its parent company or other subsidiaries 
as such  we assume that capital or other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to our parent company or other subsidiaries 
in addition  we assume that the global core excess held in our principal non us operating entities will not be available to our parent company or other subsidiaries and therefore is available only to meet the potential liquidity requirements of those entities 
in particular  many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc needs to make payments on obligations  including debt obligations 
group inc has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness  directly or indirectly  to its regulated subsidiaries  for example  as of november  group inc had billion of such equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in goldman  sachs co  its principal us regulated broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs international  a registered uk broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  a lp regulated broker dealer  and billion invested in goldman sachs japan ltd  a tokyo based broker dealer 
group inc also had billion of unsubordinated loans to these entities as of november  as well as significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries 
group inc renamed spear  leeds kellogg  lp  goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  effective january  
table of contents we also manage our intercompany exposure by requiring senior and subordinated intercompany loans to have maturities equal to or shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings of the parent company 
this policy ensures that the subsidiaries obligations to the parent company will generally mature in advance of the parent company s third party borrowings 
in addition  many of our subsidiaries and affiliates pledge collateral at loan value to the parent company to cover their intercompany borrowings other than subordinated debt in order to mitigate parent company liquidity risk 
equity investments in subsidiaries are generally funded with parent company equity capital 
as of november  group inc s equity investment in subsidiaries was billion compared with its shareholders equity of billion 
subsidiary foreign exchange policies 
our capital invested in non us subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk  substantially all of which is hedged 
currency translation adjustment  net of tax in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income decreased to million for compared with million for  primarily due to an expansion of our policy for hedging our net investment in non us subsidiaries 
in addition  we generally hedge the nontrading exposure to foreign exchange risk that arises from transactions denominated in currencies other than the transacting entity s functional currency 
crisis planning in order to be prepared for a liquidity event  or a period of market stress  we base our liquidity risk management framework and our resulting funding and liquidity policies on conservative stress scenario planning 
in addition  we maintain a liquidity crisis plan that specifies an approach for analyzing and responding to a liquidity threatening event 
the plan provides the framework to estimate the likely impact of a liquidity event on goldman sachs based on some of the risks identified above and outlines which and to what extent liquidity maintenance activities should be implemented based on the severity of the event

cash flows as a global financial institution  our cash flows are complex and interrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets and  consequently  we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above

operational risk operational risk relates to the risk of loss arising from shortcomings or failures in internal processes  people or systems  and from external events 
operational risk can arise from many factors ranging from more or less routine processing errors to potentially costly incidents arising  for example  from major systems failures 
operational risk may also entail reputational harm 
thus  efforts to identify  manage and mitigate operational risk must be equally sensitive to the risk of reputational damage as well as the risk of financial loss 
we manage operational risk through the application of long standing  but continuously evolving  firmwide control standards  the training  supervision and development of our people  the active participation and commitment of senior management in a continuous process of identifying and mitigating key operational risks at both the business unit level and for the firm as a whole  and a framework of strong and independent control departments that monitor quantitative and qualitative indicators of operational risk 
together  these elements comprise a strong firmwide control culture that is at the center of our efforts aimed at minimizing operational shortcomings and the damage they can cause 
the operational risk department is responsible for the oversight and coordination of the design  implementation and maintenance of our overall operational risk management framework 
this framework  which evolves with the changing needs of business complexities and regulatory guidance  takes into account internal and external operational risk events  business unit specific risk assessments  the ongoing analysis of business specific risk metrics and the use of scenario analysis 
while the direct responsibility for the control and mitigation of operational risk lies with the individual business units  this framework provides a consistent methodology for identifying and monitoring operational risk factors for both individual business unit managers and senior management
