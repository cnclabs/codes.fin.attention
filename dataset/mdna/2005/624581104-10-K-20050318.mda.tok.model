industry overview home video industry size and growth 
according to adams media research  the domestic home video industry grew from an estimated billion in revenue in to billion in revenue in  representing a compound annual growth rate  exceeding the growth rate of the consumer price index during the same period 
adams media expects this industry to reach billion in revenue by  fueled primarily by dvd growth 
at the end of  adams media estimates that the majority of all domestic television households owned a vcr and approximately owned a dvd player 
according to adams media  the number of households owning dvd players is expected to exceed by based on our experience  we believe that for a period of time after a household purchases a dvd player  the household generally increases both its rentals and purchases of movies 
trends 
the home video specialty retail industry continues to experience consolidation  particularly in the rural and secondary markets in which we operate 
adams media research has estimated that as of the end of there are approximately  domestic stores in our industry 
further  the three largest video store chains account for approximately  stores  or of total domestic stores 
the remaining of total stores are comprised of independent operators  small chains  franchises and other rental outlets 
we believe that the home video specialty retail industry will continue to consolidate 
over the past several years  the combination of increased product offerings  economies of scale  access to capital  and improved marketing efforts have solidified the positions of the largest retail chains versus independent operators and undercapitalized  second tier regional chains 
interdependence of movie studios and home video 
historically  new technologies  including the development of the vcr and  more recently  dvd  have led to the creation of additional distribution channels for movie studios beyond the traditional movie theater arena 
movie studios seek to maximize their revenue from distribution channels by releasing movies in sequential release date windows to the various movie distribution channels 
the order of distribution of movies is currently movie theaters  home video  which includes home video specialty retailers such as movie gallery and other distribution channels for packaged media  such as mass merchant retailers  pay per view  which includes newer video on demand vod technologies  and all other sources  including cable and syndicated television 
most movie studios release hit movie titles defined as movies with box office revenues of more than million to the home video market approximately days prior to the pay per view release date 
we believe that this window of release from the movie studios is indicative of the importance of the home video retail channel to the overall profitability of movie studios and other independent movie suppliers 
we also believe that because the sequential release method has allowed movie studios to increase their overall revenues  movie studios will continue the practice of sequential release even as vod becomes more readily available to consumers 
however  we can provide no assurance that the sequential release windows will not be narrowed or eliminated in the future 
according to industry sources  home video is currently the largest single source of domestic revenue for the movie studios  accounting for approximately of domestic studio revenue in only a small percentage of the movies produced are profitable from the studios portion of the theatrical box office receipts 
as a result  the movie studios depend on the revenues earned from the home video industry to produce substantial revenues not only from the hit movies  but from the lower grossing non hit and direct to video movies 
non hit movies defined as movies with box office revenues of less than million and direct to video films accounted for approximately of our combined purchase dollars and of title purchases in we do not believe that any other existing movie distribution channel  including vod  can provide a better market for these non hit and direct to video titles than the home video retail store 
product pricing 
the home video retail channel is comprised of both rentals and sales of dvds and videocassettes 
we purchase products under revenue sharing arrangements direct from the studios or under fixed cost arrangements with studios or distributors 
revenue sharing between retailers and movie studios was embraced by the industry in under revenue sharing  retailers and movie studios share the risks associated with the rental performance of individual titles 
the movie studios receive a fee based on a predetermined percentage  typically less than of the revenue generated from the rental of these titles 
after a specified period of time  generally six months  these titles are no longer subject to revenue sharing and are either purchased by the retailer from the movie studio for a nominal amount or returned to the studio 
revenue sharing is now being used by the studios on a broad base of titles in both dvd and vhs formats 
we believe that revenue sharing agreements provide significant advantages to retailers  including allows for substantial increases in both the quantity and selection of newly released video titles at significantly lower up front costs  provides opportunity for increases in revenues as a result of higher transaction volume  and further interdependence of movie studios and video retailers 
all movie releases are available at fixed cost pricing 
fixed cost pricing is negotiated with the studio or distributor and is typically less than per copy 
video game industry according to industry reports  domestic annual retail sales of video game hardware  software and accessories were billion in  compared to billion in total hardware sales declined to billion during  primarily due to an inadequate supply of playstation and xbox units available to retailers in the fall of even with a decrease in hardware sales  video game software sales were up to billion in  compared to billion in according to a new report from research firm dfc intelligence  the worldwide market for video games  computer games and interactive hardware and software is forecasted to grow from billion in to as much as billion by leading the market is the sony playstation brand  capturing approximately of the hardware and software sales not including handheld portables in other industry leaders are microsoft xbox  nintendo gameboy  and nintendo gamecube 
each of the three leading hardware and software companies are expected according to industry reports to release new hardware platforms in late or  helping to drive market expansion 
the video game industry is characterized by the lifecycles of hardware and software due to the rapid changes that tend to occur in technology 
growth in this industry is driven by increases in the installed base of video game hardware systems and is dependent upon the introduction of new hardware platforms and continued improvement in systems technology leading to the development of new game titles 
we believe the video game industry will continue to grow as a result of significant technological advancements made in the last few years 
these advancements allow for more flexibility and creativity in software development  as well as the introduction of hardware offering capabilities beyond gaming  such as the ability to play dvds and compact discs and the backward compatibility of game software 
competitive strengths primary focus on rural and secondary markets 
we aim to locate newly built stores in small towns or suburban areas of cities with populations typically between  and  where we can be the market leader 
we believe our focus on smaller markets allows us to achieve a higher return on invested capital with substantially less risk than we would face in larger urban markets because of the reduced level of competition  lower operating costs and our expertise in operating in rural and secondary markets 
our principal competitors are single store and small chain operators that we believe generally have smaller advertising budgets than ours  higher cost of inventory and more limited access to revenue sharing  thus resulting in limited inventory breadth and depth and less access to capital than we have 
we believe our market focus also delays competition arising from new technologies such as vod 
we expect that the rural and secondary markets in which we operate are likely to be among the last markets to build the infrastructure necessary to support vod 
the typical plant upgrades required to deliver vod are costly  and as a result  cable and digital subscriber line operators have pursued development in higher density areas where they can achieve better returns on invested capital 
low cost operator 
we believe that we are the lowest cost operator of the leading national chains 
in  our average initial investment to build new stores was approximately  per store 
this investment included leasehold improvements  fixtures  signage  and inventory net of payables 
we have developed a strategy to minimize operating expenses that includes negotiating favorable lease terms  centralized purchasing  reduced labor costs  and stringent expense controls 
flexible and disciplined business model 
we have a flexible and disciplined business model designed to maximize our revenues and reduce our costs 
the key components of our business model include flexible store formats  which allow us to tailor the size  inventory and look of each store to fit its locale  our stores average approximately  square feet  and have inventories ranging from approximately  to  movies and to  video games for rental  short lease terms that allow us to respond quickly to changing demographics  competition and other market conditions and to close non performing stores promptly  our remaining lease terms currently average three years with over leases considered for renewal each year  inventory management that targets customer demographics and customer preferences in each of our markets  and pricing management  including store specific pricing of promotional programs that are managed and modified based upon competitive  demographic and various other operating considerations 
proven acquisition strategy 
from to  we grew from stores to over stores  primarily as a result of an aggressive acquisition strategy 
in  we reinitiated our opportunistic acquisition strategy 
from the beginning of fiscal through february   we acquired  stores in separate transactions 
historically  acquired stores have been rapidly integrated into our operations with minimal disruption 
typically  we are able to increase revenue and cash flow in our acquired stores due to our product purchasing practices and economies of scale 
the average cost of converting an acquired store to the movie gallery format is minimal and consists primarily of expenditures related to new signage  implementing our point of sale system and minor remodeling 
proprietary information systems to drive revenue and enhance profitability 
we compete with other home video specialty retailers to provide our customers with a broad selection of movies and video games for rental at a competitive price 
to help us manage our inventory in the most profitable manner  we have developed proprietary management information systems and a point of sale system for our stores designed to enable us to optimize inventory levels  monitor customer purchase patterns and selection preferences  as well as provide comparative revenue data on a daily basis 
we believe these capabilities enable us to efficiently manage our rental inventory as well as reallocate rental inventory and adjust our merchandising selection to meet the specific product selection requirements of individual stores or markets 
focus on customer service 
we view the personal interaction of our employees with our customers as an integral part of our organizational culture and point of differentiation from our competitors 
we believe that our culture  together with our established training programs for our hourly employees  store managers and field management  results in a superior customer experience and higher visit frequency 
as part of our customer service initiatives  we maintain a database of approximately million active customers that captures pertinent customer preferences and purchase history and enables our store associates to provide our customers with useful product rental guidance and offer suggestive selling reminders 
we believe providing prompt  friendly and knowledgeable service helps us ensure higher levels of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty 
experienced management team 
our executive management team has demonstrated an ability to grow our business profitably through both new store openings and acquisitions 
we have a highly experienced executive management team with an average of years in home video specialty retailing and an average of years with us in an industry that is only approximately years old 
we believe this continuity has allowed us to deliver a consistent offering for our customers and in turn generate high levels of customer loyalty 
growth strategy the key objective of our growth strategy is to increase market share in our existing and new markets 
the key elements of our growth strategy are driving same store revenues and enhancing operating margins 
we focus on continuous improvement of same store revenues and profit growth through capitalizing on the continued industry growth driven by strong dvd trends  capitalizing on trends in the video game business cycle  adopting merchandising and pricing initiatives  and managing cost through effective budgeting 
developing new stores in attractive markets 
we believe that the transferability of our standardized retail format  which can be adapted easily to a variety of locations  and our record of successfully opening stores provide us with a strong foundation for expansion through new store development 
although new stores generally require approximately one year for revenues to reach the level of mature stores  we expect new stores to become profitable within the first six months of operation and produce a positive return on investment within approximately months 
we believe there are  to  markets available for further potential development in the united states that fit our typical market profile 
additionally  we see expansion opportunities in canada and are researching markets in mexico  where we operate six stores as of february  we currently expect to open approximately new stores in and  subject to market and industry conditions and the integration of our pending acquisition  if consummated  of hollywood  to continue to open new stores on a similar pace over the next several years 
pursuing opportunistic acquisitions 
we believe that growth through acquisitions is attractive because acquired stores provide an installed base of revenue and cash flow  we are able to grow more rapidly  thus providing increased benefits of scale  conversion to our formats and systems provides us with operating efficiencies  and acquisitions facilitate rapid expansion into new markets 
in evaluating potential acquisition candidates  we consider a number of factors  including strategic fit and desirability of location  price  ability to improve productivity and profitability  and whether the anticipated return on investment approximates what we expect to generate from expansion through organic growth of new stores 
we expect to continue to pursue opportunistic acquisitions  although we anticipate the majority of our growth will be from the opening of new stores 
the following table is a historical summary showing store openings  acquisitions and store closings since the beginning of fiscal fiscal year ended january to january  december  january  january  january  january  february  new store openings stores acquired stores closed total stores at end of period products we offer a wide selection of movies and video games for rent and sale 
our goal is to stock each store with a product assortment tailored to that store 
depending upon location  our stores offer from  to  movies and from to  video games for use with most video game platforms 
our revenues by product category for the last three fiscal years were as follows dvd rentals vhs rentals video game rentals previously viewed product sales dvd  vhs and video games concessions  accessories and other new movie sales dvd and vhs since fiscal  we have increased our dvd inventory to match demand as our customers transition to the dvd format 
because of the ease of use and durability of dvds  we expect that dvds will eventually replace videocassettes 
the acquisition costs of dvd hardware have reached levels competitive with the vcr  and it is estimated that as of the end of  approximately of domestic television households had dvd hardware adams media 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal  dvd rental revenue exceeded of our total movie rental revenue  versus approximately in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the fourth quarter of fiscal we monitor consumers acceptance of dvd and adjust purchasing levels as necessary to maintain the appropriate mix of dvd and vhs inventory in our stores 
in  we continued to refine our video game inventory to achieve an optimum mix of inventory relative to the customer demand within each of our markets 
the sony playstation continues to be the leading platform within our stores and generated over of our video game revenue in we will continue to monitor inventory mix and make future inventory investments accordingly 
in addition to video games  we offer basic video game hardware accessories in many of our stores and we rent and sell video game hardware in a select base of stores 
in  we began testing of game zone  a store in a store game concept for selling  renting and trading games 
we currently have approximately test stores open  and  if successful  we believe this concept could be implemented in approximately of our stores 
we review our store inventory on an ongoing basis for movies and games that have not rented for a period of time and offer these previously viewed products for sale 
store operations as of february   we operated a total of  retail stores located throughout north america 
we maintain a flexible store format  tailoring the size and inventory of each of our stores to local demographics 
our stores average approximately  square feet  with inventories ranging from approximately  to  movies and to  video games for rental 
store interiors are designed to create a visually appealing  up beat ambiance using bright lighting  vibrant graphics and carpet and coordinating signage 
the inviting atmosphere is augmented by a background of television monitors displaying mgtv  a customized video program that plays movie previews and promotions of coming attractions  and by posters and stand up displays promoting specific movie titles 
movies are arranged in attractive display boxes organized into categories by topic  except for new releases  which are assembled alphabetically in their own section for ease of selection by customers 
our stores are open seven days a week  generally from am to am on weekends and from am to am on weekdays 
we typically employ five to fourteen hourly  part time associates and one full time store manager at our stores 
store managers report to district managers  who generally supervise the operations of ten to fifteen stores 
the district managers report to one of regional managers  who in turn report to one of five zone vice presidents 
the zone vice presidents report to one of two senior vice presidents of store operations who report to our executive vice president of operations and chief operating officer 
we have increased the number of district managers and regional managers over time as necessary to support our growth 
certain members of our executive management team conduct regular meetings with the zone vice presidents  and regional and district managers to review operations 
compliance with our policies  procedures and regulations is monitored on a store by store basis through exception based reporting systems and on going store and district audits performed by the quality assurance department 
the performance and results of the quality assurance audits are monitored monthly by members of executive management 
site selection we continuously search for appropriate markets in which to develop new stores 
in selecting sites for new stores  we use an evaluation process designed to enhance our return on investment by focusing on lease terms  demographics  population density  traffic volume  store front visibility and presence  ease of access  and economic development in the market area 
we also review the location of competitive stores and customer activity at those stores 
we select both freestanding sites and sites located in strip centers anchored by major grocery or discount drug store chains 
lease terms are a critical element in our site selection process 
in negotiating lease agreements and lease renewals  we attempt to obtain short lease terms and favorable options to extend terms 
as a result  we have the flexibility necessary to react to changing demographics  competition and other market conditions 
to date  we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining favorable leases or renewals at market rates in suitable locations 
the current average remaining life of our leases is approximately years  with over leases considered for renewal each year 
we actively pursue relocation opportunities to adapt to changes in customer shopping patterns and retail market shifts 
we regularly review the profitability and prospects of each of our stores and evaluate whether any underperforming stores should be closed or relocated to more desirable locations 
the cost of closing a store is minimal and usable inventory  signage  fixtures  and equipment are transferred to existing or new locations 
marketing and advertising we use market development funds  cooperative allowances from our suppliers and movie studios  and internal funds to purchase radio  television  direct mail  and newspaper advertising  in store visual merchandising and in store media 
through the use of market development funds  our trade name is promoted along with a video or game title 
creative copy is prepared by us in conjunction with the movie studios and is placed by our in house media buyers in the appropriate medium 
we also prepare a monthly consumer magazine  video buzz  and a customized video program  mgtv  both of which feature movie gallery promotional programs and new releases 
along with these traditional forms of advertising  we have developed and implemented a customer loyalty program  reel players 
the program is based on a point system that provides customers the opportunity to earn free rentals and discounts on movie purchases 
from time to time we conduct special promotions in our stores to drive customer visits 
for example  periodically we offer a promotional rental card program similar to a prepaid gift card that provides our customers greater discounts on rentals 
we have also conducted nationwide trivia games and we occasionally partner with other major businesses such as concession vendors to help build additional revenue and increase our brand awareness to potential customers 
studio and distribution relationships we purchase the majority of our rental and sell through merchandise directly from movie studios through revenue sharing and other direct purchase arrangements 
the movies are delivered directly to our stores by third party distributors 
these distributors function largely as fulfillment agents 
we pay distributors a flat fulfillment fee for packing and shipping product directly to our stores 
because of our direct relationships with the studios  we believe that if one of our distributors were unable or unwilling to satisfy their commitment to us  a viable alternative  such as self distribution  could be implemented without materially adversely impacting our business 
several companies acquired by us prior to had pre existing long term contracts with rentrak corporation under which product would be provided under pay per transaction revenue sharing arrangements 
during late  we consolidated existing contracts with rentrak into one national agreement which had an expiration date in september the contract provided for minimum gross annual purchase commitments with the ability to satisfy the cumulative obligation as early as december  in we satisfied our obligation under the contract 
we currently source our video game inventory through direct relationships with game manufacturers publishers and from distributors 
inventory management and distribution facility inventory management 
we are committed to offering as many copies and the widest variety of new releases as is necessary to be competitive within a market  while at the same time keeping our costs as low as possible 
new dvds and videocassettes offered for sale are primarily hit titles promoted by the studios for sell through  as well as special interest and children s titles and seasonal titles related to particular holidays 
dvds  videocassettes and video games utilized as initial inventory in our newly developed stores consist of excess copies of older titles and new release titles from existing stores  supplemented as necessary by purchases directly from suppliers 
new release movie and game products are allocated to individual stores through a system that considers the revenue levels and customer demographic profiles of each store 
rental history on movie titles is captured for each store and used as a comparison point for future titles of a similar genre 
distribution facility 
inventory for new stores is assimilated at our processing and distribution facility located in dothan  alabama 
excess inventory in existing stores is gathered and supplemented as needed with purchases  and the inventory is then shipped to our new stores 
our distribution facility also ships store supplies  computer supplies and marketing materials to our stores  processes returns to our suppliers and performs stock balancing for our store chain 
management information systems our stores utilize a proprietary point of sale pos system developed by us 
our pos system provides detailed information on store operations  including the rental history of titles and daily operations for each store  which is telecommunicated to our support center on a daily or weekly basis 
our pos system is installed in all new stores prior to opening and shortly after the closing date for acquired stores 
all rental and sale information upon customer checkout and return is recorded using scanned bar code information 
all transactional data is transmitted into the management information system at the support center 
the data is processed and reports are generated that allow management to effectively monitor store operations and inventory  to review rental history by title and location and to assist in making purchasing decisions with respect to new releases 
our pos system enables us to perform our monthly physical inventory using bar code recognition to process human resource information and to provide system based training modules 
we also maintain a financial reporting system  relating to the general ledger  human resources payroll  revenue  and accounts payable functions 
additional proprietary systems that have been internally developed and implemented include a collections system  a processing distribution center system and various other database systems and auditing tools 
competition the home video specialty retail industry is highly competitive 
we primarily compete with other home video specialty stores  including stores operated by regional chains and by the two other national chains  blockbuster and hollywood 
from time to time  the two other national chains have discussed the implementation of a rural strategy that is focused more on the rural and secondary markets that we predominately serve 
retail pricing strategies for dvds  videocassettes and video games are a major competitive factor in the home video specialty industry  and we have fewer financial and marketing resources  lower market share and less brand recognition than the two other national chains 
we also compete with other businesses offering dvds  videocassettes and video games  such as mass merchants  supermarkets  pharmacies  convenience stores  bookstores  online stores  mail order operations such as netflix  and other retailers  as well as noncommercial sources  such as libraries 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the home video specialty retail industry are store location and visibility  title quality  availability and selection  rental period  customer service and pricing 
in addition to competing with other home video specialty retailers  we compete with all forms of entertainment  such as movie theaters  network and cable television  direct broadcast satellite television  personal video recorders  internet related activities  live theater  sporting events  and family entertainment centers 
we believe our most significant competition outside of the home video specialty retail industry are cable and satellite television providers 
the expanded number of channels and programming offered by these providers could result in the rental and purchase of fewer dvds and videocassettes by consumers 
we also compete with pay per view services offered by cable and satellite providers 
new and recently introduced technologies  such as vod  enable cable companies and other telecommunication companies to broadcast a large assortment of movies to homes at scheduled intervals throughout the day 
although vod services previously offered a limited number of channels and movies at scheduled intervals  developing technologies are enabling providers to transmit substantially more movies directly to homes at more frequently scheduled and convenient intervals throughout the day 
pay per view purchases could significantly increase if movies were to become available on vod during the home video rental window or if vod services were to become more convenient  widely available and accepted 
further improvements in vod and other technologies  including personal video recorders  could lead to the availability of a broad selection of movies on demand at a price that is competitive with the price of movie rentals and with the functionality of dvd and vhs 
however  we believe movie studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable movie rental business  because the sale of movies to video retail stores and other home video outlets currently represents the studios largest source of domestic revenue 
in addition  we believe that vod does not represent a material near term threat to our business because studios have not yet determined how vod can enhance revenues instead of merely cannibalizing highly lucrative dvd and vhs sales revenue  vod does not allow for the impulse rental opportunities from browsing through lesser known titles that video specialty stores offer  the technology and infrastructure to compress and deliver vod in a scalable  cost effective manner  particularly within our market demographics  has not yet been developed on a significant scale  and piracy and other electronic security issues have not yet been adequately addressed 
some retailers have begun to rent or sell dvds through kiosks or vending machines 
additionally  the technology exists to offer disposable dvds which would allow a consumer to view a dvd an unlimited number of times during a specified period of time  at the end of which the dvd becomes unplayable 
we cannot predict the impact that future technologies will have on our business 
seasonality there is a distinct seasonal pattern to the home video business 
compared to other months during the year  we experience peak revenues during the months of november  december and january due to the holidays in these months as well as inclement weather conditions 
additionally  revenues generally rise in the months of june  july and august when most schools are out of session  providing people with additional discretionary time to spend on entertainment 
intellectual property we own a number of us and international service mark registrations  including the marks movie gallery and game zone 
foreign operations for disclosure of enterprise wide financial information by geographic area  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this form k 
employees as of february   we employed approximately  persons  referred to by us as associates  including approximately  in retail stores and the remainder in our support center  field management staff and distribution facility 
of our retail associates  approximately  were full time and  were part time 
none of our associates are represented by a labor union and we believe that our relations with our associates are good 
we have developed internal hiring  training and retention programs designed to enhance consistent and thorough communication of our operating policies and procedures as well as increase the rate of internal promotions 
we also have an incentive and discretionary bonus program under which retail management associates receive quarterly bonuses when stores meet or exceed criteria established under the program 
additionally  we have periodic sales and marketing programs that provide our associates opportunities to earn incremental bonus compensation based on relative performance to pre established goals and to actual performance compared to other associates 
we believe our bonus programs reward excellence in management  give associates an incentive to improve operations and result in an overall reduction in the cost of operations 
in addition  certain associates are eligible to receive bonuses based on individual and overall company performance  and options to purchase shares of our common stock  exercisable at the fair market value on the date of grant  subject to service requirements 
employees meeting prescribed service requirements are also eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan established by us

forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this form k might not occur 
in addition  actual results could differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements  and therefore you should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  and in that regard  we caution the readers of this form k that the following important factors  among others  could affect our actual results of operations and may cause changes in our strategy with the result that our operations and results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us  or on our behalf 
we assume no obligation and specifically disclaim any such obligation to update the following cautionary statements or any other forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward looking statements 
the occurrence of any of the following risks  among others  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations if we are successful in our efforts to acquire hollywood  we will incur substantial indebtedness to fund the acquisition  which could have a material effect on our financial condition 
if we acquire hollywood  we expect to have approximately billion in long term indebtedness  as compared to no long term debt as of january  our high level of indebtedness could have significant consequences  including our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  additional acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available for other purposes such as capital expenditures and dividends  if we default on our obligations  our lenders may foreclose on our assets that secure our indebtedness  restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the overall significant amount of indebtedness may reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in our industry and making dividend payments and may put us at a competitive disadvantage  and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
the integration of hollywood and movie gallery may strain our resources and prove to be difficult and may subject us to liabilities 
hollywood s revenue base is significantly larger than movie gallery and this merger is substantially larger than any of our previous acquisitions 
the expansion of our business and operations resulting from the acquisition of hollywood  including the differences in the strategies and infrastructures of our companies  may strain our administrative  operational and financial resources 
the integration of movie gallery and hollywood will require substantial time  effort  attention and dedication of management resources and may distract management in unpredictable ways from their other responsibilities 
the integration process could create a number of potential challenges and adverse consequences  including the possible unexpected loss of key employees or suppliers  a possible loss of sales  an increase in operating and other costs and the need to modify operating accounting controls and procedures to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  the integration of hollywood may subject us to liabilities existing at hollywood  some of which may be unknown at the time we consummate the merger 
these types of challenges and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operation 
we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy 
our long term strategy is to grow through new store openings and acquisitions of existing stores 
successful implementation of this strategy is contingent upon numerous conditions  and we cannot assure you that our business plan can be successfully executed 
we require significant capital to open new stores and to acquire existing stores 
recently  our growth strategy has been funded primarily through proceeds from public offerings of common stock  internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings 
these and other sources of capital  including public or private sales of debt or equity securities  may not be available to us in the future on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
additionally  the terms of the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness may limit our ability to make capital expenditures or incur further indebtedness in order to open new stores or to acquire existing stores 
new store openings 
our ability to open new stores as planned  and the profitability of these new stores  may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including our ability to identify and secure new sites  our ability to negotiate acceptable leases and timely implement cost effective development plans for new stores  the availability of capital  our ability to hire  train and assimilate skilled store managers and other personnel  and the ability to integrate new stores into existing operations 
if we do not grow as planned  our future earnings expectations could be negatively impacted 
our planned growth may result in increased pressure on our management and operations 
we continuously review and modify our financial controls and management information systems 
there are no assurances that we will be able to anticipate and respond to  in a timely and sufficient manner  the potential changing demands this expansion could have on our operations and business 
we also may open stores in markets where we already have significant operations in order to maximize market share within these markets 
if this occurs  these newly opened or acquired stores could adversely affect the revenues and profitability of other stores in the same market 
in addition  there are no assurances that our new stores will realize revenue or profitability levels comparable to those of our current stores  or that such levels will be achieved within our estimated time frames 
acquisitions 
our ability to acquire stores and operate them at the desired levels of sales and profitability may be adversely affected by our inability to identify acquisition candidates that fit our criteria eg  size  location and profitability  our inability to consummate identified acquisitions due to  among other things  a lack of available capital  a reduction in the number of stores available for purchase by us due to  among other factors  a decline in the number of acquisition targets that are willing to sell at prices we consider reasonable  increased competition for acquisitions  misrepresentations and breaches of contracts by sellers  our limited knowledge of the operating history of the acquired stores  our failure to rapidly convert the acquired stores operating and information systems to our systems and procedures  and our inability to retain and motivate employees of the acquired stores 
pending acquisition of hollywood 
our pending acquisition of hollywood is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions  including the approval of the shareholders of hollywood and our consummation of financing necessary to fund the acquisition 
as a result  we may not be successful in acquiring hollywood 
our business could be adversely affected by increased competition 
from time to time  the two other national chains in our industry  including hollywood  which we have agreed to acquire subject to satisfaction of conditions  have publicly discussed the implementation of a rural strategy that is focused more on the rural and secondary markets that we predominately serve 
therefore  we cannot assure you that blockbuster and hollywood in the event we do not consummate our proposed acquisition will not become a more significant competitive force in our markets 
even if we complete our proposed acquisition of hollywood  blockbuster could expand its operations in rural markets 
pricing strategies for movies and video games are a major competitive factor in the video retail industry and we have fewer financial and marketing resources  lower market share and less name recognition than the two larger chains 
other types of entertainment  such as theaters  television  personal video recorders  internet related activities  sporting events  and family entertainment centers  also compete with our movie and video game businesses 
if any of our competitors were to substantially increase their presence in the markets we serve  our revenues and or profitability could decline  our financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations could be harmed and the continued success of our business could be challenged 
our business could be adversely affected if we lost key members of our executive management team 
we are highly dependent on the efforts and performance of our executive management team 
if we were to lose any key members of this team  our business could be adversely affected 
you should read the information under directors and executive officers for a detailed description of our executive management team 
our business could be adversely affected by the failure of our management information systems to perform as expected 
we depend on our management information systems for the efficient operation of our business 
our merchandise operations use our inventory utilization system to track rental activity by format for each individual movie and video game title to determine appropriate buying  distribution and disposition of our inventory 
we also rely on a scalable client server system to maintain and update information relating to revenue  rental and sales activity  movie and video game rental patterns  store membership demographics  and individual customer history 
these systems  together with our point of sale and in store systems  allow us to control our cash flow  keep our in store inventories at optimum levels  move our inventory more efficiently and track and record our performance 
if our management information systems failed to perform as expected  our ability to manage our inventory and monitor our performance could be adversely affected  which  in turn  could harm our business and financial condition 
our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to manage our merchandise inventory effectively 
our merchandise inventory introduces risks associated with inventory management  obsolescence and theft 
while most of our retail movie product is returnable to vendors  the investment in inventory necessary to capitalize on the growing retail market increases our exposure to excess inventories in the event anticipated sales fail to materialize 
in addition  returns of video game inventory  which is prone to obsolescence risks because of the nature of the industry  are subject to negotiation with vendors 
the prevalence of multiple game platforms may make it more difficult to accurately predict consumer demand with respect to video games 
the nature of and market for our products  particularly games and dvds  also makes them prone to risk of theft and loss 
our exposure is somewhat mitigated by price protection that is available on certain inventory 
price protection provides credit for on hand inventory quantities 
our operating results could suffer if we are unable to maintain the appropriate levels of inventory to support customer demand without building excess inventories  obtain or maintain favorable terms from our vendors with respect to product returns  control shrinkage resulting from theft  loss or obsolescence  and avoid significant inventory excesses that could force us to sell products at a discount or loss 
our business could be negatively impacted if movie studios significantly alter the movie distribution windows 
studios distribute movies in a specific sequence in order to maximize studio revenues on each title they release 
the order of distribution of movies is currently movie theaters  home video retailers  pay per view  and all other sources  including cable and syndicated television 
our industry has an early window that is exclusive of most other forms of non theatrical movie distribution as noted in industry overview home video industry interdependence of movie studios and home video 
the length of the movie rental window varies  but is typically approximately days prior to the pay per view release date 
the movie studios are not contractually obligated to continue to observe these window periods 
as a result  we cannot be certain that movie studios will maintain this exclusive window in the future 
we could be adversely affected if the movie studios shorten or eliminate these exclusive windows  or if the movie rental windows were no longer among the first windows following the theatrical release  because newly released movies would be made available earlier through other forms of non theatrical movie distribution 
as a result  consumers would no longer need to wait until after the home video distribution window to view these movies through other distribution channels 
changes like these could negatively impact the demand for our products and reduce our revenues and could harm our business  financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations 
our business may be negatively impacted by new and existing technologies 
advances in technologies that benefit our competitors may materially and adversely affect our business 
for example  advances in cable and direct broadcast satellite technologies  including high definition digital television transmissions offered through those systems  may adversely affect public demand for video store rentals 
expanded content available through these media  including movies  specialty programming and sporting events  could result in fewer movies being rented 
in addition  higher quality resolution and sound offered through these services and technologies could require us to increase capital expenditures  for example  to upgrade our dvd inventories to provide movies in high definition 
cable and direct broadcast satellite technologies offer both movie channels  for which subscribers pay a subscription fee for access to movies selected by the provider at times selected by the provider  and pay per view services  for which subscribers pay a discrete fee to view a particular movie selected by the subscriber 
historically  pay per view services have offered a limited number of channels and movies and have offered movies only at scheduled intervals 
over the past five years  however  advances in digital compression and other developing technologies have enabled cable and satellite companies  and may enable internet service providers and others  to transmit a significantly greater number of movies to homes at more frequently scheduled intervals throughout the day 
certain cable companies  internet service providers and others are also testing or offering video on demand  vod services 
as a concept  vod provides a subscriber with the ability to view any movie included in a catalog of titles maintained by the provider at any time of the day 
if pay per view  vod or any other alternative movie delivery systems achieve the ability to enable consumers to conveniently view and control the movies they want to see  when they want to see them  such alternative movie delivery systems could achieve a competitive advantage over the traditional home video rental industry 
this risk would be exacerbated if these competitors receive the movies from the studios at the same time video stores do and by the increased popularity and availability of personal digital recording systems such as tivo that allow viewers to record  pause  rewind  and fast forward live broadcasts and create their own personal library of movies 
in addition  we may compete in the future with other distribution or entertainment technologies that are either in their developmental or testing phases now or that may be developed in the future 
for example  some retailers have begun to rent or sell dvds through kiosks or vending machines 
additionally  the technology exists to offer disposable dvds  which would allow a consumer to view a dvd an unlimited number of times during a specified period of time  at the end of which the dvd becomes unplayable 
we cannot predict the impact that future technologies will have on our business 
if any of the technologies described above create a competitive advantage for our competitors  our business  financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations could be harmed 
our industry has experienced negative same store revenues in the rental business in recent quarters 
while we cannot ascertain the extent to which these declines are attributable to any of the specific technological developments described above  we cannot assure you that these declines will not recur 
our business could be adversely affected if consumers decide to purchase rather than rent movies 
historically  studios priced a number of movies they distributed at pricing which was typically too high to generate significant consumer demand to purchase these movies 
a limited number of titles were released at a lower price point when consumers were believed to be more likely to have a desire to purchase a certain title 
the penetration of dvd into the market has resulted in a significant increase in the quantity of newly released movies available for purchase by the consumer 
these movies are purchased to rent by home video specialty retailers  and to sell by both home video specialty retailers and mass merchants  among others 
retail margins are generally lower than rental margins 
some of our competitors  such as online stores  mass merchants and warehouse clubs may operate at margins lower than ours and may be able to distribute and sell movies at lower price points than us 
these competitors may even be willing to sell movies below cost due to their broad inventory mix 
further decreases in studio pricing and or sustained or further depressed pricing by competitors could result in increased consumer desire to purchase rather than rent movies and could result in increased competition 
if we are not able to derive most of our revenues from our higher margin rental business  our profit levels would be adversely impacted and we may not be able to compete with our competitors for the consumer s sell through dollar 
our business could be adversely impacted if movie studios negatively altered revenue sharing programs 
prior to studio revenue sharing programs and the advent of dvd  we would typically pay between and per videocassette for major theatrical releases not priced as sell through titles 
under studio revenue sharing programs  we are able to pay a minimal up front cost per unit and thereafter pay a percentage of each revenue dollar earned for a specified period of time to the studios 
we currently utilize these types of programs on a significant number of dvd and vhs movie releases 
these programs have enabled us to significantly increase the number of copies carried for each title  thereby enabling us to better meet consumer demand 
after a specified period of time  we offer them for sale to our customers as previously viewed movies at lower prices than new copies of the movie 
we could be adversely affected if these programs are changed to give the movie studios a greater percentage of each revenue dollar or if they are discontinued 
further  some of our agreements may be terminated on short notice 
our gross margins may be adversely affected if the average sales price for our previously viewed product is not at or above an expected price 
we earn rental revenues from video rentals and from the sale of previously viewed movies to the public 
we need to sell previously viewed movies at an expected price in order to achieve our gross margin targets 
our gross margins may be adversely affected if the number of rentals we expect to generate does not materialize or if the average sales price for previously viewed movies is not at or above our target price 
a consumer s desire to own a particular movie and the number of previously viewed movies available for sale to the public by our competitors are factors that affect our ability to sell previously viewed movies at our target price 
additionally  sales of previously viewed movies also compete with newly released movies that are priced for sell through 
as a result  there are no assurances that we will be able to sell an appropriate quantity of previously viewed movies at or above the expected price 
if selling prices for previously viewed movies or previously played games decline  we may be required to write down the carrying value of our rental inventory 
the video store industry could be adversely affected by conditions impacting the motion picture industry 
the availability of new movies produced by the movie studios is vital to our industry 
the quality and quantity of new movies available in our stores could be negatively impacted by factors that adversely affect the motion picture industry  such as financial difficulties  regulatory requirements and work disruptions involving key personnel such as writers or actors 
a decrease in the quality and quantity of new movies available in our stores could result in reduced consumer demand  which could negatively impact our revenues and harm our business and financial position 
our business could be adversely affected if video game software and hardware manufacturers do not introduce new products in a timely manner 
the video game industry is characterized by the significant impact on consumer spending that accompanies the introduction of new game software and hardware platforms 
retail spending in the video game industry typically grows rapidly with the introduction of new platforms but declines considerably prior to the release of new platforms 
consumer demand for video games available in our stores could be adversely affected if manufacturers fail to introduce new games and systems in a timely manner 
a decline in consumer demand for video games available in our stores could negatively affect our revenues and harm our business and financial position 
our business may be negatively impacted by our participation in new business initiatives 
we are currently exploring various new business initiatives 
these new initiatives include a game store within a store concept game zone  movie and game trading within our stores  and various other alternatives for delivery of media content 
we cannot assure you that these initiatives will be either successful or profitable 
our earnings could be negatively impacted by investments in these initiatives 
piracy of the products we offer may adversely affect our results of operations 
the development of the internet and related technologies increases the threat of piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated content 
we cannot assure you that movie studios and others with rights in the product will take steps to enforce their rights against internet piracy or that they will be successful in preventing the distribution of pirated content 
technological developments and advances of products such as at home dvd burners also may increase piracy of movies and games 
increased piracy could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations 
the value of our securities may be affected by variances in our quarterly operating results that are unrelated to our long term performance 
historically  our quarterly operating results have varied  and we anticipate that they will vary in the future 
factors that may cause our quarterly operating results to vary  many of which we cannot control  include consumer demand for our products  prices at which we can rent or sell our products  timing  cost and availability of newly released movies  new video games and new video game systems  competition from providers of similar products  other forms of entertainment  and special events  such as the olympics or ongoing major news events of significant public interest  seasonality  acquisitions by us of existing stores  variations in the timing and number of store openings  profitability of new stores  weather patterns that can significantly increase business inclement conditions that prohibit outdoor activities or decrease business mild temperatures and dry conditions that reduce the consumer s desire to relax indoors  and acts of god such as the unprecedented hurricane activity that affected our southeastern market in the fall of or public authorities  war  civil unrest  fire  floods  earthquakes  acts of terrorism  and other matters beyond our control 
our revenues and operating results fluctuate on a seasonal basis and may suffer if revenues during peak seasons do not meet expectations 
the home video retail industry generally experiences relative revenue declines in april and may  due in part to the change in daylight savings time and due to improved weather  and in september and october  due in part to the start of the traditional school year and the introduction of new television programs 
the industry typically experiences peak revenues during the months of november  december and january due to the holidays in these months as well as inclement weather conditions 
additionally  revenues generally rise in the months of june  july and august when most schools are out of session  providing people with additional discretionary time to spend on entertainment 
the game sales business is traditionally strongest in november and december  as title releases are often clustered around the holiday shopping season 
in view of seasonal variations in our revenues and operating results  comparisons of our revenues and operating results for any period with those of the immediately preceding period or the same period of the preceding fiscal year may be of limited relevance in evaluating historical financial performance and predicting future financial performance 
our working capital  cash and short term borrowings also fluctuate during the year as a result of the factors set forth above 
our operating results may suffer if revenues during peak seasons do not meet expectations 
if revenues during these periods do not meet expectations  we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset increased costs incurred in preparation for peak seasons and operating results may suffer 
finally  the operational risks described elsewhere in these risk factors may be exacerbated if the events described therein were to occur during a peak season 
the market price for our common stock may fluctuate substantially 
we have experienced  and continue to expect  periodic fluctuations in our stock price due to technological advancements  developments concerning our business  our competitors or the home video specialty retail industry  including fluctuations in our operating results  the introduction of new products  the performance of other similar companies  changes in financial estimates by financial analysts or our failure to meet these estimates and other factors 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and market prices for the stock of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock  business  and results of operations or financial condition 
while we have historically experienced relatively low volatility in our stock price  we cannot assure you that our stock price will not experience significant fluctuations in the future 
historically  companies that have experienced market price volatility have been the target of securities class action litigation 
we could incur significant costs and our management s time and resources could be diverted from the operation of our business if we were the target of securities class action litigation 
terrorism  war or other acts of violence could have a negative impact on our stock price or our business 
terrorist attacks  as well as the on going events in iraq or other acts of violence and civil unrest in the nation and throughout the world  could influence the financial markets and the economy 
consumers television viewing habits may be altered as a result of these events such that the demand for home video entertainment is reduced 
these factors could have a negative impact on our results of operations or our stock price

adjusted ebitda is defined as net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities  interest and taxes 
adjusted ebitda is presented primarily as an alternative measure of liquidity  although we also use it as an internal measure of performance for making business decisions and compensating our executives 
it is also a widely accepted financial indicator in the home video specialty retail industry of a company s ability to incur and service debt  finance its operations and meet its growth plans 
however  our computation of adjusted ebitda is not necessarily identical to similarly captioned measures presented by other companies in our industry 
we encourage you to compare the components of our reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to cash flows from operations in relation to similar reconciliations provided by other companies in our industry 
our presentation of net cash provided by operating activities and adjusted ebitda treats rental inventory as being expensed upon purchase instead of being capitalized and amortized 
we believe this presentation is meaningful and appropriate because our annual cash investment in rental inventory is substantial and in many respects is similar to recurring merchandise inventory purchases considering our operating cycle and the relatively short useful lives of our rental inventory 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda excludes the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities 
this adjustment eliminates temporary effects attributable to timing differences between accrual accounting and actual cash receipts and disbursements  and other normal  recurring and seasonal fluctuations in working capital that have no long term or continuing affect on our liquidity 
investors should consider our presentation of adjusted ebitda in light of its relationship to cash flows from operations  cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities as shown in our statements of cash flows 
adjusted ebitda is not necessarily a measure of free cash flow because it does not reflect periodic changes in the level of our working capital or our investments in new store openings  business acquisitions  or other long term investments we may make 
however  it is an important measure used internally by the executive management of our company in making decisions about where to allocate resources to grow our business 
in prior periods  we presented a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to operating income 
we changed the format of our reconciliation beginning in the first quarter of fiscal to reconcile adjusted ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities 
we have recast the reconciliations for prior periods to conform to the new presentation 
adjusted ebitda for fiscal years and has been restated to include the impact of non recurring charges of million related to a supply contract amendment and million related to a legal settlement  respectively  which were added back to the calculation of adjusted ebitda in prior year presentations 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities as follows in thousands fiscal year ended december  january  january  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities tax benefit of stock options exercised deferred income taxes interest expense income taxes adjusted ebitda same store revenues are calculated based on the aggregate revenues from stores we have operated for at least months 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate approximately  home video retail stores that rent and sell movies and video games  primarily in rural and secondary markets throughout north america 
we compete with the other two national chains blockbuster and hollywood in approximately one third of our store locations 
we believe that we are the market leader in the majority of our target markets  where we do not compete with the other two national chains 
we estimate that there are approximately  to  markets still available for expansion in rural america  where we do not compete with the other two national chains  as well as additional opportunities throughout canada and mexico 
we currently plan to open approximately new stores in and  subject to market and industry conditions  and the integration of our pending acquisition  if consummated  of hollywood  to continue to open new stores at a similar pace over the next several years 
we believe the most significant dynamic in our industry is the relationship our industry maintains with the movie studios 
the studios have historically maintained an exclusive window for home video distribution packaged goods  which provides the home video industry with an approximately day period during which they can rent and sell new releases before they are made available on pay per view or other distribution channels 
according to adams media research  the home video industry currently provides approximately of studio revenue 
for this reason  we believe movie studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable home video business 
for a more detailed discussion of our business and the home video industry  see the business discussion contained in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
our strategies are designed to achieve reasonable  moderate and consistent growth in same store revenues and profitability in a mature industry 
we strive to minimize the operating and overhead costs associated with our business  which allows us to maximize profitability and which has proven to be a successful operating model for us 
our compound annual growth rate for consolidated revenue and operating income from to is and  respectively 
in addition to the relationship between our industry and the movie studios  our operating results are driven by revenue  inventory  rent  and payroll 
given those key factors  we believe that by monitoring the five operating performance indicators described below  we can continue to be successful in executing our operating plans and our growth strategy 
revenues 
our business is a cash business with initial rental fees paid upfront by the customer 
our management team constantly works with inventory levels  marketing and sales promotions  real estate strategies  and personnel issues in order to maximize profitable revenues at each location 
additionally  our team monitors revenue performance on a daily basis to quickly identify trends or issues in our store base or in the industry as a whole 
product purchasing economics 
in order to maintain the desired profit margin in our business  purchases of inventory for both rental and sale must be carefully managed 
our purchasing models are designed to analyze the impact of the economic factors inherent in the various pricing strategies employed by the studios 
we believe that we are able to achieve purchasing levels tailored for the customer demographics of each of our markets and to maximize the return on investment of our inventory purchase dollars 
store level cost control 
the most significant store expenses are payroll and rent  followed by all other supply and service expenditures 
we attempt to control these expenses primarily through budgeting systems and centralization of purchases into the corporate support center 
this enables us to measure performance carefully against expectations and to leverage our purchasing power 
our rural focus also provides the benefit of reduced labor and real estate costs in the secondary markets we serve versus the costs associated with larger urban markets 
leverage of overhead expenses 
we apply the same principles of budgeting  accountability and conservatism in our overhead spending that we employ in managing our store operating costs 
our general and administrative expenses include the costs to maintain our corporate support center as well as the overhead costs of our field management team 
operating cash flows 
we have generated significant levels of cash flow for several years 
we have historically been able to fund the majority of our store growth and acquisitions  as well as ongoing inventory purchases  from cash flow generated from operations 
the following discussion of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources will provide further insight into our performance over the last three years 
pending acquisitions on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger merger agreement with hollywood corporation nasdaq hlyw hollywood providing for our acquisition of hollywood for approximately million in cash plus our assumption of approximately million in debt of hollywood 
hollywood is the second largest home video specialty retailer in the united states  operating approximately  stores in states and the district of columbia  some of which contain the approximately game crazy video game specialty retail stores  where game enthusiasts can buy  sell and trade new and used video game hardware  software and accessories 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we will merge a subsidiary of ours with and into hollywood  with hollywood surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary 
upon consummation of the merger  the shareholders of hollywood will receive in cash for each outstanding share of hollywood common stock that they own 
in addition  each option to purchase hollywood common stock will be cancelled in exchange for an amount equal to less the exercise price of the option 
in connection with the merger agreement and the refinancing of substantially all of the existing indebtedness of hollywood and movie gallery including our existing million unsecured revolving credit facility with southtrust bank now wachovia  we expect to obtain a senior secured credit facility guaranteed by hollywood and all of our material subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of million  consisting of a new million revolving credit facility with a million accordion feature and two term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of million 
wachovia bank  national association and merrill lynch capital corporation and their affiliates will arrange the senior secured credit facility 
we also anticipate that wachovia capital markets  llc will arrange for an offering of senior unsecured notes by us in an amount of up to million 
we expect that the maturities in our revolving credit facility and term loans will be five or six years from the consummation of the merger and that the maturity of the senior notes will be seven or eight years from the consummation of the merger 
as part of the refinancing of hollywood s debt  at our request  hollywood will commence a tender offer for its million principal amount senior subordinated notes due consummation of the hollywood merger is subject to the satisfaction of a variety of closing conditions  including the approval of the proposed merger by the shareholders of hollywood and our consummation of the financing necessary to fund the acquisition 
in addition  both we and hollywood have customary termination rights in some circumstances  including a right by hollywood to terminate the merger agreement to accept an unsolicited superior acquisition proposal 
we can make no assurances that we will successfully acquire hollywood or  if we do acquire hollywood  that we will successfully integrate its business with our business 
the combination of our company and hollywood would create the second largest north american video rental company with pro forma combined annual revenue of approximately billion and approximately  stores located in all us states  canada and mexico 
the acquisition will substantially increase our presence on the west coast and in urban areas 
hollywood s predominantly west coast urban superstore locations present little overlap with our predominantly east coast rural and suburban store locations 
we also believe that there is an opportunity to improve the profitability of hollywood because the combined companies will offer potential general and administrative cost savings and increased purchasing leverage 
if we are successful in acquiring hollywood  we anticipate that we would maintain the hollywood format and brand separately from our movie gallery business because of hollywood s distinct operational model and to ensure customer continuity after the acquisition 
during our integration of the operations of hollywood with ours  we will evaluate our operational  growth  dividend and other strategies and policies discussed in this report and will modify our strategies and policies as appropriate or required by industry and operating conditions 
on march   we entered into a definitive agreement with vhq to commence a tender offer for all of its outstanding common stock at a price of c per share 
total consideration for the transaction is approximately c million us million  including c million in equity and c million in assumed debt 
the common stock of vhq trades on the toronto stock exchange under the symbol vhq 
vhq owns and operates video rental stores in secondary and suburban markets in alberta  saskatchewan and the northwest territories 
the vhq transaction is conditioned upon  among other matters  the tender of two thirds of vhq s outstanding shares into the offer and the receipt of certain third party consents 
shareholders of vhq representing approximately of the outstanding shares have committed to tender their shares into our offer 
the transaction is also subject to customary regulatory approvals  including receipt of notice from the minister of culture that the acquisition provides a net benefit to canada  consistent with the conditions of the investments canada act 
lease accounting charge subsequent to the end of fiscal  we completed a comprehensive review of our accounting for leases and leasehold improvements including the recognition of incentive payments received from landlords 
we determined that leasehold improvements  in some cases  were depreciated over a longer period than the lease term 
as a result  we recorded a cumulative fourth quarter adjustment to correct depreciation expense of million million after tax or per diluted share  of which million million after tax or per diluted share of the adjustment was related to years prior to and was not considered material to any of the prior period financial statements to warrant a restatement of those financial statements 
this accounting adjustment does not affect our historical or future cash flows 
this correction will increase depreciation expense in fiscal by approximately million

for fiscal and  total revenues increased and  respectively  from the prior years 
the increases were primarily due to same store revenue growth of in fiscal and increases in the average number of stores operated in fiscal and of and  respectively 
the revenue increase in fiscal was partially offset by a same store revenue decrease of 
the following factors contributed to a decrease in our same store revenues for fiscal versus a weak home video release schedule in fiscal  primarily in the third and fourth quarters  contributed to flat movie rental revenue comps  there were fewer titles in with box office revenues greater than million than in most of which were concentrated in the third and fourth quarters  a decline in revenue from the game rental business of approximately  reflecting the weakness of the new game titles currently being released and industry softness that occurs in anticipation of the introduction of new game platforms currently scheduled for a late release  additionally  there was a shortage of playstation and xbox game hardware in the fourth quarter of  a decrease in product sales revenue of approximately due to a reduction in new release sell through movie inventory  disruption of normal daily operations at approximately stores in florida and alabama due to an unprecedented hurricane season in august and september of  and the broadcast of the summer olympics during the third quarter of the increase in same store revenues for fiscal over fiscal resulted primarily from dvd rental revenue growth of approximately  offset partially by a decline in vhs rental revenue of approximately due to the continuing consumer transition to the dvd format  growth of approximately in sales of previously viewed movie inventory  video game rental revenue increases of approximately  growth in product sales revenue of approximately  primarily as a result of a significant expansion of new movie inventory available in the stores beginning during the latter half of  as well as the continuing consumer transition to the dvd format  and continued revenue growth in the video update stores we acquired in december with an overall same store revenues increase of approximately 
the impact of the video update growth is also included in the overall revenue growth by category as described in the previous bullet points 
the mix of total revenue between rental revenue and product sales revenue reflects an elevated level of product sales revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal and this elevation was due to a significant expansion of new movie inventory available in our stores in order to accommodate the increased consumer demand for retail movies and to complement our rental business during the height of the transition of our customer base to the dvd format 
this expansion began during the latter half of fiscal and was maintained throughout fiscal in the early part of fiscal  we began to reduce our levels of new release movie inventory available for sale in the stores in order to focus the mix on higher margin inventory items 
we evaluate our product sales inventory mix and inventory levels on a regular basis and make periodic adjustments to our retail inventory mix based on our operating strategies and customer trends 
product sales revenue has been less than of total revenue in each of the last five years 
we expect rental revenue to continue to represent the majority of our business 
cost of sales 
the cost of rental revenues includes the amortization of rental inventory  revenue sharing expenses incurred and the cost of previously viewed rental inventory sold 
the gross margin on rental revenue for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a strategic decision to make a portion of our base stock  or catalog  vhs rental inventory available for sale during the holiday period as previously viewed inventory 
the sale of base stock vhs rental inventory was designed to make room on our store shelves for a significant investment in base stock dvd rental inventory  which arrived in stores in the first quarter of and did not have a material impact on our gross margin 
our decision to make this investment in base stock dvd was primarily driven by the continued growth in consumer acceptance of the dvd platform in our core markets throughout and resulted in a corresponding change in the estimates used to amortize rental inventory 
the rental margin for fiscal and includes approximately million and million  respectively  related to this change in estimate 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
excluding the impact of the rental inventory amortization change  the rental margin for fiscal and would have been and  respectively  compared to in fiscal the most significant factors that impacted the fiscal rental margin were an increase in the margin due to the comparison against the impact of the million charge related to the fiscal change in estimate as described above  offset by pressure on the rental margin due to negative same store revenues of and softness in the game industry  as previously discussed 
the increase in the fiscal rental margin was primarily the result of comparison against the impact of the million charge in fiscal for a change in estimate as described above  the increasing shift of movie rentals from vhs to dvd dvd rentals constituted approximately and of total movie rentals in fiscal and  respectively  dvd has a lower cost structure than vhs has historically had  and the acceptance of dvd has influenced reductions in studio pricing of the vhs format during the last year  offset partially by amortization of our million investment in dvd catalog inventory that took place in the first quarter of as described above 
cost of product sales includes the costs of new dvds  videocassettes  concessions  and other goods sold 
theatrical new movie releases typically have a much lower margin than concessions and other goods 
the gross margin on product sales is subject to fluctuation based on the relative mix of low margin sales of theatrical new movie inventory to higher margin sales of concessions and other items 
the gross margin on product sales for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
the decrease in the fiscal product sales margin reflects the expanded selection of lower margin  theatrical new movie releases to complement the transition of our customer base to the dvd format  as previously discussed 
the product sales margin increase in fiscal reflects an overall shift in our inventory mix to higher margin inventory items as a result of a reduction in the levels of theatrical new release movie inventory available for sale in the stores 
operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses include store level expenses such as lease payments  in store payroll and start up costs associated with new store openings 
store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we reclassified costs associated with our investments in various alternative delivery vehicles for movie content from store operating expenses to equity in losses of unconsolidated entities in our statements of income 
costs from the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal is primarily due to an increase to depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of million of which million relates to prior years related to the correction of errors in our historical amortization practice for leasehold improvements  the decrease in same store revenues in  as certain operating expenses are fixed and result in an increase as a percentage of revenue when revenues decline  and continued growth in the number of new store openings generating store opening and start up costs for a larger number of immature stores in the revenue base versus the prior year our store base has increased by or more in each of the last three years 
the following factors contributed to a reduction in store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal same store revenues increase of in fiscal  strong performance of new stores  continued closure of under performing units  continued initiatives to reduce operating costs  leverage from our video update transaction against the same store revenue increases  offset slightly by growth in the number of new store openings generating store opening and start up costs for a larger number of immature stores in the revenue base versus the prior year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from fiscal to is due to the same store revenue decrease of in fiscal  and overhead increases to support our future growth plans  which include continued expansion in geographic areas where our market penetration is lower and costs associated with some of our new business initiatives 
the decrease from fiscal to is primarily the result of the same store revenue increase of in fiscal  comparison against a legal settlement charge of million with respect to our extended viewing fee policy in fiscal  and elevated costs and expenses in fiscal associated with the conversion of the video update stores point of sale system  offset partially by overhead increases to support new initiatives and our future growth plans  which include expansion into new geographic areas where our market penetration is lower 
stock option compensation expense in periods prior to the third quarter of represents the non cash charge associated with certain stock options that were repriced during the first quarter of fiscal and are subsequently accounted for as variable stock options 
due to the relatively small number of these options that remain outstanding  we expect future adjustments to income from non cash stock option compensation to be immaterial 
stock option compensation during fiscal also includes expense related to our decision to repurchase  shares of common stock from current and former executives  resulting in compensation expense of approximately  being recognized for the intrinsic value of those options see note to our consolidated financial statements 
operating income 
as a result of the impact of the above factors on revenues and expenses  operating income increased by in fiscal and by in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense includes fees for the unused borrowings available under our credit facility and amortization of the associated debt issue costs  as well as the costs of any outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  net of interest income 
we repaid all of our outstanding debt in may with the proceeds from our common stock offering  resulting in a reduction of interest expense in fiscal versus interest expense increased in fiscal versus as a result of borrowings outstanding for several months during equity in losses of unconsolidated entities 
during the last half of  we began to make some investments in various alternative delivery vehicles both retail and digital for movie content  and we began to explore other business initiatives within our existing base of stores  including tests of a game store within a store  movie trading and in store movie subscriptions 
we do not anticipate that any of these alternatives will replace our base video rental business 
however  we do believe it is appropriate to make selective investments in synergistic opportunities that could potentially provide ancillary sources of revenue and profitability to our base rental business 
the expenses associated with our investments in alternative delivery vehicles are reflected as equity in losses of unconsolidated entities on our statements of income 
 net of tax  for and million  net of tax  for 
these costs were previously included in store operating expenses on the statements of income 
income taxes 
we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards at january  of approximately million and million  respectively see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these net operating loss carryforwards resulted primarily from the video update acquisition in and expire in years through during the year  adjustments were made to the valuation allowance for state net operating losses that were not charged to income tax expense in the amount of million 
accordingly  we have adjusted our recorded valuation allowance to million related to the net deferred tax assets of million 
this valuation allowance has been established since there exists uncertainty regarding our ability to realize these net operating losses in their entirety 
in forming our conclusion about the future recoverability of the net operating losses from our acquisition of video update  we considered  among other things  the applicable provisions of the federal tax code  which limit the deductibility of net operating loss carryforwards to the post acquisition taxable income on a cumulative basis of the acquired subsidiary on a separate return basis  as well as other limitations that may apply to the future deductibility of these net operating losses 
we also considered the availability of reversing taxable temporary differences during the carryforward period  the length of the available carryforward period  recent operating results  and our expectations of future taxable income during the carryforward period  changes in tax law  irs interpretive guidance  and judicial rulings 
if facts and circumstances in the future should warrant an increase in the net operating loss carryforwards expected to be realized  a reduction in the valuation allowance would occur and may result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate  which was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
deferred income tax liabilities have increased during fiscal this is primarily the result of a significant acceleration in the tax depreciation of newly purchased assets since the fourth quarter of the acceleration on tax depreciation was due to special provisions implemented after the events of september  that expired on december  accordingly  it is anticipated that the cumulative excess tax depreciation levels we currently have will begin to decline 
a portion of this decline may continue to be offset by continued new store growth 
we have analyzed each deferred tax asset and determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
accordingly  we have concluded that  apart from the valuation allowance related to the net operating losses  no additional valuation allowances are necessary as of the end of fiscal in our evaluation of the deferred tax assets related to the capital loss carryforward and the equity investments  we concluded that there existed viable and feasible tax planning strategies that we could implement to realize these deferred assets 
it should be noted that a change in the valuation of certain capital assets may impact the tax planning strategy relied upon 
should this occur  it could impact the analysis and require that a valuation allowance be placed against all or a portion of these deferred tax assets 
general economic trends  quarterly results of operations and seasonality our business is subject to fluctuations in operating results due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these fluctuations may be caused by  among other things the number  timing and performance of new or acquired stores  public acceptance of  interest in  and availability of newly released movies  our mix of products rented versus sold  marketing programs and new release acquisition costs  seasonality compared to other months during the year  we experience peak revenues during the months of november  december and january due to the holidays in these months as well as inclement weather conditions 
additionally  revenues generally rise in the months of june  july and august when most schools are out of session  providing people with additional discretionary time to spend on entertainment  and special events  such as the olympics or ongoing major news events of significant public interest 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs are for opening and acquiring new stores and for purchasing inventory 
other capital needs include refurbishing  remodeling and relocating existing stores and refreshing  rebranding and supplying new computer hardware for acquired stores 
we fund inventory purchases  remodeling  rebranding  and relocation programs  new store opening costs and acquisitions primarily from cash flow from operations and  as necessary  from loans under our credit facility 
at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  no long term debt and million in available borrowings under our credit facility 
fiscal year ended january  january  january  in thousands statements of cash flow data net cash provided by operating activites net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities other data adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda percent of total revenue the increases in net cash provided by operating activities were primarily attributable to the revenue growth as a result of the continued expansion of our store base  offset partially in fiscal by a decline in same store revenues 
net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funding for substantially all of our rental inventory replenishment and capital resource needs 
in the first quarter of  we began reporting the on going purchases of new release rental inventory as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows rather than as an investing activity as previously reported 
we believe this classification is appropriate because our annual cash investment in rental inventory is substantial and in many respects is similar to recurring merchandise inventory purchases considering our operating cycle and the relatively short useful lives of our rental inventory 
purchases of rental inventory for new stores or other significant investments in base stock rental inventory continue to be classified as investing activities in the statements of cash flows as these purchases represent a long term investment in our business 
rental inventory purchases in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation for comparative purposes 
the reclassification had no impact on our financial position or results of operations as previously reported 
the fiscal balance sheet reflects the reclassification of certain outstanding checks 
the reclassifications were made between cash and cash equivalents  prepaid expenses and accounts payable in order to conform with current year presentation 
the corresponding reclassifications were made in the cash flows for fiscal and the reclassifications reduced net cash provided by operating activities by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities includes the costs of business acquisitions  new store additions and investments in base stock rental inventory 
the decreases in net cash used in investing activities during fiscal and were primarily due to declining levels of business acquisitions  offset partially by increased new store openings and in fiscal  by the purchase of a corporate aircraft and lighting retrofits in many of our stores to achieve savings in the cost of utilities 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal primarily reflects million in net proceeds from a common stock offering  partially offset by the net repayment of million in long term debt 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share and paid dividends to shareholders of million  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  resulting in net cash used in financing activities of million 
the only financing activity in fiscal was proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
in each quarter of fiscal  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share under our dividend policy instituted in december we currently intend to continue to pay similar quarterly cash dividends on our common stock 
however  the payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
future dividends may be increased  decreased or suspended from time to time based on a number of factors  including changes in tax laws related to dividends  our financial condition  capital requirements  future business prospects  our successful integration of hollywood assuming we consummate the proposed acquisition  the terms of any documents governing our indebtedness including the terms of the financing we may consummate to fund our proposed acquisition of hollywood  and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant 
adjusted ebitda in fiscal and increased and  respectively  over the prior years 
the increase was primarily driven by revenue growth as a result of the continued expansion of our store base  offset partially in fiscal by a decline in same store revenues and an increase in the investments of alternative delivery vehicles 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities  interest and taxes 
adjusted ebitda is presented primarily as an alternative measure of liquidity  although we also use it as an internal measure of performance for making business decisions and compensating our executives 
it is also a widely accepted financial indicator in the home video specialty retail industry of a company s ability to incur and service debt  finance its operations and meet its growth plans 
however  our computation of adjusted ebitda is not necessarily identical to similarly captioned measures presented by other companies in our industry 
we encourage you to compare the components of our reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to cash flows from operations in relation to similar reconciliations provided by other companies in our industry 
our presentation of net cash provided by operating activities and adjusted ebitda treats rental inventory as being expensed upon purchase instead of being capitalized and amortized 
we believe this presentation is meaningful and appropriate because our annual cash investment in rental inventory is substantial and in many respects is similar to recurring merchandise inventory purchases considering our operating cycle and the relatively short useful lives of our rental inventory 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda excludes the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities 
this adjustment eliminates temporary effects attributable to timing differences between accrual accounting and actual cash receipts and disbursements  and other normal  recurring and seasonal fluctuations in working capital that have no long term or continuing affect on our liquidity 
investors should consider our presentation of adjusted ebitda in light of its relationship to cash flows from operations  cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities as shown in our statements of cash flows 
adjusted ebitda is not necessarily a measure of free cash flow because it does not reflect periodic changes in the level of our working capital or our investments in new store openings  business acquisitions  or other long term investments we may make 
however  it is an important measure used internally by the executive management of our company in making decisions about where to allocate resources to grow our business 
in prior periods  we presented a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to operating income 
we changed the format of our reconciliation beginning in the first quarter of fiscal to reconcile adjusted ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities 
we have recast the reconciliations for prior periods to conform to the new presentation 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities as follows in thousands fiscal year ended january  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities tax benefit of stock options exercised deferred income taxes interest expense income taxes adjusted ebitda note that adjusted ebitda for fiscal has been restated to include the impact of a million non recurring charge related to a legal settlement which was added back to the calculation of adjusted ebitda in the prior year presentation 
on june   we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  led by southtrust bank now wachovia  with respect to a revolving credit facility 
our credit facility is unsecured and  as amended in september  provides for an increase in borrowings from million up to million and an extended maturity date of july  the interest rate on our credit facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin percentage  which depends on cash flow generation and borrowings outstanding 
as of january   there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
the amounts available for borrowing were reduced by standby letters of credit outstanding of million and totaled million as of january  the following table discloses our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years credit facility outstanding operating leases total contractual cash obligations the total commercial commitment under our credit facility is million  which expires on july  as of january   there were standby letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility of  of which  expires in  and  expires in at january   we had a working capital deficit of million  primarily due to the accounting treatment of rental inventory 
rental inventory is treated as a noncurrent asset under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because it is a depreciable asset and a portion of this asset is not reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle within one year 
although the rental of this inventory generates the major portion of our revenue  the classification of this asset as noncurrent results in its exclusion from working capital 
the aggregate amount payable for this inventory  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  is reflected as a reduction in working capital 
consequently  we believe that working capital is not an appropriate measure of our liquidity  and we anticipate that we will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
we grow our store base through internally developed and acquired stores 
we opened internally developed stores  acquired stores and closed stores during fiscal we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in as they arise 
to the extent available  new stores and future acquisitions may be completed using funds available under our credit facility  financing provided by sellers or alternative financing arrangements  such as funds raised in public or private debt or equity offerings 
however  we cannot assure you that financing will be available to us on terms which will be acceptable  if at all 
capital requirements to fund new store growth in fiscal  including the base stock rental inventory investment  were million 
additionally in fiscal  we incurred million in other on going capital expenditure requirements for the existing store base 
capital requirements to fund new store growth in fiscal  including the base stock rental inventory investment  are estimated at million 
we expect other ongoing capital expenditures for to approximate million 
in fiscal  we expect capital requirements to fund the acquisitions of hollywood and vhq to total approximately billion 
we expect to finance the amounts through cash on hand  borrowings under our new senior secured credit facility and our proposed offering of senior unsecured notes 
see pending acquisitions 
we purchase rental inventory under two different cost structures 
under fixed cost arrangements  we pay a flat purchase price with no further obligations to our vendor 
under revenue sharing arrangements  we pay a lower fixed cost per unit and then share a predetermined portion of the future rental revenues with the studio for an agreed upon period of time following the release date of the product 
fixed cost purchases are capitalized and amortized as rental inventory on our balance sheet  in accordance with our stated accounting policies 
the fixed portion of the cost of revenue share product is capitalized and amortized as rental inventory on our balance sheet  while the revenue sharing payments are expensed as incurred and reflected in gross profit on our income statement 
rental inventory purchases included in net cash provided by operating activities include the costs of all our fixed cost purchases as well as the fixed portion of costs associated with our revenue share product  while the revenue sharing expenses are reflected in net cash provided by operating activities through net income 
note that rental inventory purchases for new stores or other significant investments in base stock rental inventory are not classified as operating activities  but instead as investing activities in our statements of cash flows 
rental inventory purchases will be higher in periods with more fixed cost purchases versus revenue share purchases 
the mix of fixed cost and revenue share product purchased in any given period is dependent upon the purchasing economics of the titles released in that period and is not determined until the monthly orders are placed with our suppliers 
as such  we are unable to provide guidance regarding the expected future amounts of rental inventory purchases as reflected in our statements of cash flows 
we believe our projected cash flow from operations  cash on hand  borrowing capacity under our credit facility  and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to fund our current plan of operations  including our anticipated new store openings and acquisition program  excluding our proposed acquisition of hollywood  through fiscal our proposed acquisition of hollywood will require debt financing in an aggregate amount of approximately billion and will include a refinancing of our existing revolving credit facility 
to fund additional major acquisitions  or to provide funds in the event that our need for funds is greater than expected  or if the financing sources identified above are not available to the extent anticipated  or if we increase our growth plan  we may need to seek additional or alternative sources of financing 
this financing may not be available on satisfactory terms  or at all 
failure to obtain financing to fund our expansion plans or for other purposes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our ability to fund our current plan of operations and our growth plan will depend upon our future performance  including  if we acquire hollywood  our successful integration and operation of its business which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to fund capital resource needs  cover the ongoing costs of operating the business and service any debt incurred in the future 
if we are unable to satisfy these requirements with cash flow from operations and cash on hand  we may be required to sell assets or to obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that any such sales of assets or additional financing could be obtained 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revised statement  share based payment statement r  to address the accounting for stock based employee plans 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and instead requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method of accounting 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of proforma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
statement r is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after june  critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements as filed in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe our most critical accounting estimates include our policies with respect to rental inventory amortization  impairment of long lived assets  purchase price allocation of acquired businesses and deferred income taxes 
a major component of our cost structure is the amortization of our rental inventory 
rental inventory is amortized to an estimated salvage value over an estimated useful life of up to two years 
we amortize the cost of rental inventory using an accelerated method designed to approximate the rate of revenue recognition 
this method is based on historical customer demand patterns from street date the date studios release various titles for distribution to our stores through the end of the average useful life 
in order to determine the appropriate useful lives and salvage values  we analyzed the actual historical performance trends of our rental inventory 
we quantified the average rate of revenue recognition on our products and developed amortization rates and useful lives that approximate the rental turns of our inventory 
our established salvage values are based on an evaluation of the sale prices we are able to realize from our customers on used inventory  prices observed in bulk sale transactions and prices observed in other open market purchases of used inventory  as well as the salvage values established by competitors in our industry 
we believe our estimated useful lives and salvage values are appropriately matched to our current rental business and are consistent with industry trends 
however  should rental patterns of consumers change or should market values of previously viewed inventory decline due to the acceptance of new formats eg  ongoing vhs transition to dvd  anticipated transition to high definition dvd within three to five years  release of new video game formats  etc  this could necessitate an acceleration in our current rental amortization rates  a reduction in salvage values or a combination of both courses of action 
we believe that any acceleration in the rental amortization rates would not have a long lasting impact  as the majority of our current rental purchases are substantially depreciated within the first two to three months after street date under our existing policy 
we could be required to reduce salvage values that we currently carry on vhs inventory if we are unable to dispose of that inventory at a rate relatively consistent with the consumers transition to dvd 
in the past  we have generally been able to anticipate the rate of transition from one format to another and manage our purchases  as well as inventory mix  to avoid significant losses on the ultimate disposition of previously viewed movies 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully anticipate the impact of the transition to dvd or any other formats in the future  and we could incur losses on the sale of previously viewed movies in the future 
as of january   and january   we had million and million  respectively  in rental inventory on our balance sheet 
vhs  dvd and games constituted  and  respectively  of total rental inventory units as of january  compared to  and  respectively  of total units as of january  as of january   the net book value of our vhs rental inventory is approximately of the net book value of our total rental inventory 
we assess the fair value and recoverability of our long lived assets  including rental inventory  property  furnishings and equipment  and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  we make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors in order to make our determination 
the fair value of our long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of our business  changes in the video retail industry  the market valuation of our common stock  and the overall economic environment 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon the excess of the carrying value that exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
if we do not meet our operating forecasts or if the market value of our stock declines significantly  we may have to record impairment charges not previously recognized 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
we have not recorded any impairment losses on goodwill since a fiscal impairment charge of  if we do not meet our operating forecasts or if the market value of our stock declines significantly  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
as of january   we have million in goodwill on our balance sheet 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities of acquired businesses based on historical experience and available information at the acquisition date 
we engage independent valuation specialists to assist when necessary 
if information becomes available subsequent to the acquisition date that would materially impact the valuation of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations  we may be required to adjust the purchase price allocation 
with the exception of the video update acquisition in  we have not experienced any significant adjustments to the valuation of assets or liabilities acquired in business combinations in the last seven years 
our acquisitions are typically small businesses for which we generally do not assume liabilities and for which the assets acquired consist primarily of inventory  fixtures  equipment  and intangibles 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards nols that we acquired in the acquisition of video update 
in forming our conclusion about the future recoverability of the net operating losses from our acquisition of video update  we considered  among other things  the applicable provisions of the federal income tax code  which limit the deductibility of net operating loss carryforwards to the post acquisition taxable income cumulative basis of the acquired subsidiary on a separate return basis  as well as other limitations that may apply to the future deductibility of these net operating losses 
we also considered the availability of reversing taxable temporary differences during the carryforward period  the length of the available carryforward period  recent operating results  our expectations of future taxable income during the carryforward period  changes in tax law  irs interpretive guidance and judicial rulings 
if facts and circumstances in the future should warrant elimination or reduction of the valuation allowance related to these nols  our effective income tax rate  which was  and for fiscal  and  respectively  could be reduced

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the increased interest costs arising from adverse changes in interest rates primarily libor and prime bank rates 
we currently have no amounts outstanding under our credit facility  and thus no exposure to adverse interest rate changes 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risks associated with our canadian and mexican operations 
historically  the canadian exchange rates have been relatively stable  and we believe the impact of fluctuations in the currency exchange rates will be immaterial to our financial position and results of operations 
based on fiscal results  a hypothetical change in the canadian exchange rate would not have a significant effect on either our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
our mexican operations are currently limited to six locations 
growth in mexico in is not expected to be significant enough to result in a material impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates
