overview we are engaged in oil and natural gas exploitation  acquisition  exploration and production activities primarily in the rocky mountains  permian basin  gulf coast  michigan  mid continent and california regions of the united states 
over the last four years  we have emphasized the acquisition of properties that provided current production and significant upside potential through further development 
our drilling activity is directed at this development  specifically on projects that we believe provide repeatable successes in particular fields 
our combination of acquisitions and development allows us to direct our capital resources to what we believe to be the most advantageous investments 
during periods of radically changing prices  we focus our emphasis on drilling and development of our owned properties 
when prices stabilize  we generally direct the majority of our capital to acquisitions 
we have historically acquired operated as well as non operated properties that meet or exceed our rate of return criteria 
for acquisitions of properties with additional development  exploitation and exploration potential  our focus has been on acquiring operated properties so that we can better control the timing and implementation of capital spending 
in some instances  we have been able to acquire non operated property interests at attractive rates of return that provided a foothold in a new area of interest or complemented our existing operations 
we intend to continue to acquire both operated and non operated interests to the extent we believe they meet our return criteria 
in addition  our willingness to acquire non operated properties in new geographic regions provides us with geophysical and geologic data in some cases that leads to further acquisitions in the same region  whether on an operated or non operated basis 
we sell properties when we are of the opinion that the sale price realized will provide an above average rate of return for the property or when the property no longer matches the profile of properties we desire to own 
our revenue  profitability and future growth rate depend substantially on factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for oil or natural gas could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce and our access to capital 
acquisitions we completed seven separate acquisitions of producing properties during the combined purchase price for these seven acquisitions was million for total estimated proved reserves as of the effective dates of the acquisitions of approximately bcfe 
because of our substantial recent acquisition activity  our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods discussed below may not necessarily be comparable with or applicable to our future results of operations 
our historical results include the results from our recent acquisitions beginning on the following dates equity oil company  july   permian basin  september   wyoming and utah  september   colorado and wyoming  august   louisiana and texas  august   mississippi  november   and additional permian basin interest  december  permian basin properties on september   we acquired interests in seventeen fields in the permian basin of west texas and southeast new mexico  including interests in key fields such as parkway field in eddy county  new mexico  would have and signal peak fields in howard county  texas  keystone field in winkler county  texas  and the deb field in gaines county  texas 
the purchase price was million in cash and was funded through borrowings under our bank credit agreement 
based on the purchase price and estimated proved reserves of bcfe on the effective date of the acquisition  we acquired these properties for approximately per mcfe of estimated proved reserves 
equity oil company we acquired of the outstanding stock of equity oil company on july  in the merger  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to equity s shareholders and repaid all of equity s outstanding debt of million under its credit facility 
equity s operations are focused primarily in california  colorado  north dakota and wyoming 
based on the purchase price of million and estimated proved reserves of bcfe on the effective date of the acquisition  we acquired these properties for approximately per mcfe of estimated proved reserves 
other cash acquisitions of properties colorado and wyoming properties 
on august   we acquired interests in four producing oil and gas fields in colorado and wyoming 
the purchase price was million in cash and was funded under our bank credit agreement 
based on the purchase price of million and estimated proved reserves of bcfe on the effective date of the acquisition  we acquired these properties for approximately per mcfe of estimated proved reserves 
louisiana and south texas properties 
on august   we acquired interests in five fields in louisiana and south texas 
the purchase price was million in cash and was funded under our bank credit agreement 
based on the purchase price of million and estimated proved reserves of bcfe on the effective date of the acquisition  we acquired these properties for approximately per mcfe of estimated proved reserves 
wyoming and utah properties 
on september   we acquired interests in three operated fields in wyoming and utah 
the purchase price was million in cash and was funded under our bank credit agreement 
based on the purchase price of million and estimated proved reserves of bcfe on the effective date of the acquisition  we acquired these properties for approximately per mcfe of estimated proved reserves 
mississippi properties 
on november   we acquired an interest in the lake como field in mississippi 
the purchase price was million in cash and was funded under our bank credit agreement 
based on the purchase price of million and estimated proved reserves of bcfe on the effective date of the acquisition  we acquired these properties for approximately per mcfe of estimated proved reserves 
additional permian basin interest 
on december   we acquired an additional working interest in the would have field in texas 
the purchase price was million in cash and was funded under our bank credit agreement 
based on the purchase price and estimated proved reserves of bcfe on the effective date of the acquisition  we acquired these properties for approximately per mcfe of estimated proved reserves

year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
our oil and natural gas sales revenue increased approximately million to million in sales are a function of sales volumes and average sales prices 
our sales volumes increased between periods on a mcfe basis 
the volume increase resulted from successful drilling and acquisition activities over the past year that produced new sales volumes that more than offset natural decline 
our average price for natural gas sales increased and our average price for crude oil increased between periods 
loss on oil and natural gas hedging activities 
we hedged of our natural gas volumes during incurring no hedging loss or gain  and of our natural gas volumes during incurring a hedging loss of million 
we hedged of our oil volumes during incurring a hedging loss of million  and of our oil volumes during incurring a loss of million 
see item a  qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for a list of our outstanding oil and natural gas hedges as of february  gain on sale of marketable securities 
during  we sold all of our holdings in delta petroleum  inc  which trades publicly under the symbol dptr 
we realized gross proceeds of million and recognized a gain on sale of million 
at december   we had no investments in marketable securities 
gain on sale of oil and gas properties 
during the third quarter of  we sold certain undeveloped acreage held by production in wyoming 
no value had been assigned to the acreage when we acquired it over five years ago 
as a result  the recognized gain on sale is equal to the gross proceeds of million 
lease operating expenses 
our lease operating expenses per mcfe decreased from during to during the decrease was less than  which represented improved operating efficiency more than offsetting price inflation caused by increased demand for goods and services in the industry 
our fourth quarter lease operating expense per mcfe was also  indicating that the seven acquisitions we completed during the third and fourth quarters of have not significantly affected this rate 
production taxes 
the production taxes we pay are generally calculated as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales revenue before the effects of hedging 
we take full advantage of all credits and exemptions allowed in the various taxing jurisdictions 
due to our broad asset base  we expect our production tax rate to vary between to of oil and natural gas sales revenue 
our production taxes for and were and of oil and natural gas sales  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a increased million to million for the increase resulted from increased production and an increase in the dd a rate  as well as the effects of our recent acquisitions 
on a mcfe basis  the rate increased from during to in the increase in rate is primarily due to property acquisitions  which we purchased at an average cost of per mcfe  which was higher than our historical rate 
changes to the pricing environment can also impact our dd a rate 
price increases allow for longer economic production lives and corresponding increased reserve volumes and  as a result  lower depletion rates 
price decreases have the opposite effect 
the components of our dd a expense were as follows in thousands year ended december  depletion   depreciation accretion of asset retirement obligations   total   exploration and impairment costs 
our exploration and impairment costs increased million to million in the higher exploratory costs were related to our increased purchases of seismic data in to support our increased drilling budget 
the impairment charge represents the write down of cost associated with the high island field located off the coast of texas 
year ended december  exploration   impairment  total   general and administrative expenses 
we report general and administrative expense net of reimbursements 
the components of our general and administrative expense were as follows year ended december  general and administrative expenses   reimbursements   general and administrative expense  net   general and administrative expense before reimbursements increased million to million during on a mcfe basis  the increase between years was from to 
the largest component of the increase related to costs associated with our production participation plan 
during periods of increased acquisition activity  our general and administrative expense will be higher because we must immediately recognize the discounted value of estimated plan payments to employees and older 
the discounted value of estimated payments to employees under is generally amortized over a five year vesting period 
costs related to the production payment plan increased million between years to million in the remaining increase was primarily caused by the extra costs of functioning as a public company  increases in the employee base due to our continued growth and general cost inflation 
the increase in reimbursements was caused by an increase in operated properties due to the seven property acquisitions 
we expect our general and administrative expense to decline to approximately per mcfe sold in due to cost synergies from recent acquisitions 
interest expense 
the components of our interest expense were as follows year ended december  senior subordinated notes due  credit agreement   alliant energy corporation  accretion of tax sharing liability  amortization of debt issue costs and debt discount   capitalized interest total interest expense   the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the may issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due in august of  million of the face amount of the notes was swapped to a floating rate 
the effect of the swap in was to lower our overall effective interest rate on this debt from to approximately 
at december   the floating rate component was set at through may   yielding a current weighted average effective interest rate on the million issuance of 
interest expense on our credit agreement in was  less than this was primarily the result of average outstanding borrowings in being approximately million lower than the effective cash interest rate paid in each year on the credit agreement was approximately 
the decrease in interest expense related to alliant energy corporation  our former parent company  was due to the march  conversion of million of intercompany debt into our equity 
the accretion of our tax sharing liability is related to a step up in tax basis effected immediately prior to our initial public offering in november the increase was due to a full year of accretion expense in the increase in debt issue and debt discount amortization was due to the amortization of additional fees in to refinance our credit agreement and issue million of our senior subordinated notes due income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million for and million for  resulting in effective income tax rates of for both years 
the current portion of income tax expense was million in compared to million in these amounts are and of the total income tax expense for the respective periods 
prior to our initial public offering in november  we were included in the consolidated federal income tax return of alliant energy and calculated our income tax expense on a separate return basis at alliant energy s effective income tax rate 
immediately prior to our initial public offering  alliant energy effected a step up in the tax basis of whiting oil and gas corporation s assets  which had the result of increasing our future tax deductions 
these additional deductions  combined with an increase in intangible drilling costs  allowed us to lower the percentage of taxes paid currently  even with the significant increase in oil and gas prices between years 
cumulative change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement generally applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and requires us to recognize the fair value of asset retirement obligations in our financial statements by capitalizing that cost as a part of the cost of the related asset 
this statement applies directly to plug and abandonment liabilities associated with our net working interest in well bores 
the additional carrying amount is depleted over the estimated useful lives of the properties 
the discounted liability is based on historical abandonment costs in specific areas and the discount is accreted at the end of each accounting period through charges to dd a 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded an increase to our discounted asset retirement obligations of million  increased proved property cost by million and recognized a one time cumulative effect charge of million net of a deferred tax benefit of million 
net income 
net income increased from million for to million for the primary reasons for this increase included higher crude oil and natural gas prices net of hedging between periods  increase in equivalent volumes sold  the impact of the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 
in  the impact of property and marketable security sales in  offset by higher lease operating expense  general and administrative  dd a  interest and exploration and impairment costs in year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales revenue increased approximately million to million in natural gas sales increased million and oil sales increased million 
the natural gas sales increase was caused by a increase in the average realized natural gas price from per mcf in to per mcf in combined with a  mcf volume increase in natural gas sales between years 
the oil sales increase was caused by a sales volume increase of  bbls in and an increase in the average realized oil price from in to in the volume increase for oil and natural gas primarily resulted from the million of capital expenditures during and loss on oil and natural gas hedging activities 
we hedged of our natural gas volumes during  incurring a hedging loss of million  and of our natural gas volumes during  incurring a loss of million 
we hedged of our oil volumes during  incurring a hedging loss of million  and of our oil volumes during  incurring a loss of million 
gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties 
in  we divested one property  realizing a gain of million 
no significant properties were sold in lease operating expenses 
our lease operating expenses per mcfe increased from in to in the increase resulted from acquisitions during that caused a larger portion of our operations to be located in michigan and north dakota  where weather conditions  sulfur content and remote locations create higher operating costs in comparison to our other areas of operation 
production taxes 
production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were in and in the small increase in the effective rate resulted from additional property purchases in the states of north dakota and montana  where effective production tax rates are higher on average than other areas where we own significant producing properties 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
dd a expense decreased by million in the decrease was a result of a decrease in the average rate from per mcfe in to per mcfe in  partially offset by increased sales volumes in the lower rate was a result of higher prices between periods  which allowed for a longer economic production life and corresponding increased reserve volumes and  as a result  a lower dd a rate 
exploration costs 
exploration costs increased million to million for the increase was the result of recording three exploratory dry holes during compared to one exploratory dry hole in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million in this increase was related to increases in compensation expense associated with increased personnel required to administer our growth and to general cost inflation 
phantom equity plan compensation 
the completion of our initial public offering in november constituted a triggering event under our phantom equity plan 
under this plan  our employees received compensation of million in the form of  shares of our common stock after withholding of shares by us for estimated payroll and income taxes 
the phantom equity plan is now terminated 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million in the decrease was due lower average debt levels in and lower effective interest rates in the lower debt levels were primarily related to a march decision by alliant energy to convert its remaining million of intercompany debt into our equity thereby lowering our future interest expense 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was in and during the increased effective tax rate was in part due to our acquisitions in the state of north dakota where the effective state income tax rate is higher on average than other areas where we own significant producing properties 
in addition  during we generated million of section credits that we were not able to offset against tax expense 
under our tax separation and indemnification agreement with alliant energy  we expect to be compensated for these credits in the future when they are utilized by alliant energy 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the recording of the tax credits in were required to be charged as additional paid in capital rather than as a decrease to our income tax expense 
section tax credit provisions of the internal revenue code expired december  therefore  unless additional legislation is passed  section credits will not be available in periods subsequent to cumulative change in accounting principle 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement generally applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and requires us to recognize the fair value of asset retirement obligations in our financial statements by capitalizing that cost as a part of the cost of the related asset 
this statement applies directly to plug and abandonment liabilities associated with our net working interest in well bores 
the additional carrying amount is depleted over the estimated useful lives of the properties 
the discounted liability is based on historical abandonment costs in specific areas and is accreted at the end of each accounting period through charges to accretion expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount  a gain or loss is recognized on settlement 
upon adoption of afas no 
 we recorded an increase to our discounted abandonment liability of million  increased proved property cost by million and recognized a one time cumulative effect charge of million net of a deferred tax benefit of million 
net income 
net income increased from million in to million in the primary reasons for this increase included higher crude oil and natural gas prices between periods and higher volumes sold  offset by higher lease operating  tax and general and administrative costs due to our growth 
liquidity and capital resources overview 
we entered with million of cash and cash equivalents 
during  we generated million from operating activities and million from financing activities 
we used these sources of cash primarily to finance capital expenditures of million used to drill and acquire properties 
at december   our debt to total capitalization ratio was  we had million of cash on hand and million of stockholders equity 
we continually evaluate our capital needs and compare them to our capital resources 
our budgeted capital expenditures for the further development of our property base are million to million during  an increase from the million spent on capitalized development during our development spending was a increase from the million spent on development during we also spent million on acquisitions in the second half of  funded primarily by borrowings under whiting oil and gas corporation s credit agreement 
although we have no specific budget for property acquisitions  we will continue to seek property acquisition opportunities that complement our existing core property base 
we expect to fund our development expenditures from internally generated cash flow and cash on hand 
we believe that should attractive acquisition opportunities arise or development expenditures exceed million  we could finance the additional capital expenditures with cash on hand  operating cash flow  borrowings under our credit agreement  issuances of additional equity or development with industry partners 
our level of capital expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly depending on available opportunities  commodity prices  cash flows and development results  among other factors 
credit agreement 
whiting oil and gas corporation has a million credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that  as of december   provided a borrowing base of million 
the borrowing base under the credit agreement is determined in the discretion of the lenders based on the collateral value of our proved reserves that have been mortgaged to the lenders and is subject to regular redetermination on may and november of each year as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement 
on november   we repaid million of debt outstanding under the credit agreement using proceeds from a public offering of  shares of our common stock and cash on hand 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance under the credit agreement was million 
the credit agreement provides for interest only payments until september   when the entire amount borrowed is due 
we may  throughout the term of the credit agreement  borrow  repay and reborrow up to the borrowing base in effect from time to time 
the lenders under the credit agreement have also committed to issue letters of credit for our account from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed million of the amount of the borrowing base available at the time of the request 
as of december   letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under the credit agreement 
interest accrues  at our option  at either the base rate plus a margin where the base rate is defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate and the margin varies from to depending on the utilization percentage of the borrowing base  or at the libor rate plus a margin where the margin varies from to depending on the utilization percentage of the borrowing base 
we have consistently chosen the libor rate option since it delivers the lowest effective interest rate 
commitment fees of to accrue on the unused portion of the borrowing base  depending on the utilization percentage  and are included as a component of interest expense 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to  among other things  pay cash dividends  incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  make loans to others  make investments  enter into mergers  change material contracts  incur liens and engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders and requires us to maintain a debt to ebitdax as defined in the credit agreement ratio of less than to and a working capital ratio of greater than to we are in compliance with the credit agreement provision that requires us to hedge at least  but not more than  of our total forecasted pdp production for the period november  through december  in the form of costless collars or fixed price swaps  with a minimum floor price of per barrel of oil or per mmbtu of natural gas 
after december   the credit agreement will not require us to hedge any of our production  but will continue to limit our hedging to a maximum of of our forecasted pdp production 
in addition  while the credit agreement allows our subsidiaries to make payments to us so that we may pay interest on our senior subordinated notes  it does not allow our subsidiaries to make payments to us to pay principal on the senior subordinated notes 
we were in compliance with our covenants under the credit agreement as of december  the credit agreement is secured by a first lien on substantially all of whiting oil and gas corporation s assets 
whiting petroleum corporation and equity oil company have guaranteed the obligations of whiting oil and gas corporation under the credit agreement  whiting petroleum corporation has pledged the stock of whiting oil and gas corporation and equity oil company as security for its guarantee and equity oil company has mortgaged substantially all of its assets as security for its guarantee 
senior subordinated notes due in may  we issued  in a private placement  million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the net proceeds of the offering were used to retire all of our debt outstanding under whiting oil and gas corporation s credit agreement 
the notes were issued at of par and the associated discount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes 
the notes are unsecured obligations of ours and are subordinated to all of our senior debt 
the indenture governing the notes contains restrictive covenants that may limit our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things  pay cash dividends  redeem or repurchase our capital stock or our subordinated debt  make investments  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  sell assets  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of us and our restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole and enter into hedging contracts 
these covenants may limit the discretion of our management in operating our business 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  three of our subsidiaries  whiting oil and gas corporation  whiting programs  inc and equity oil company  have fully  unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed our obligations under the notes 
alliant energy promissory note 
in conjunction with our initial public offering in november  we issued a promissory note payable to alliant energy corporation  our former parent company  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the note bears interest at an annual rate of 
all principal and interest on the promissory note are due on november tax separation and indemnification agreement with alliant energy 
in connection with our initial public offering in november  we entered into a tax separation and indemnification agreement with alliant energy 
pursuant to this agreement  we and alliant energy made a tax election with the effect that the tax basis of the assets of whiting oil and gas corporation and its subsidiaries were increased to the deemed purchase price of their assets immediately prior to such initial public offering 
we have adjusted deferred taxes on our balance sheet to reflect the new tax basis of our assets 
this additional basis is expected to result in increased future income tax deductions and  accordingly  may reduce income taxes otherwise payable by us 
under this agreement  we have agreed to pay to alliant energy of the future tax benefits we realize annually as a result of this step up in tax basis for the years ending on or prior to december  such tax benefits will generally be calculated by comparing our actual taxes to the taxes that would have been owed by us had the increase in basis not occurred 
in  we will be obligated to pay alliant energy the present value of the remaining tax benefits assuming all such tax benefits will be realized in future years 
the initial recording of this transaction in november resulted in a million increase in deferred tax assets  a million discounted payable to alliant energy and a million increase to stockholders equity 
during  we did not make any payments under this agreement but did recognize million of accretion expense  which is included as a component of interest expense 
our estimate of payments to be made under this agreement of million in is reflected as a current liability at december  schedule of contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments as of december  to make future payments under certain contracts  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods 
this table does not include asset retirement obligations or production participation plan liabilities since we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future payments 
this table also does not include interest expense since we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances and repayments and the future interest rate to be charged under floating rate instruments 
during august  we entered into an interest rate swap on million of our million fixed rate senior subordinated notes due the amount of interest we expect to pay relating to the million of our senior subordinated notes remaining under the fixed rate is million annually through the term of the notes 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt     operating lease     tax separation and indemnification agreement with alliant energy    total      amounts shown are estimates based on estimated future income tax benefits from the increase in tax basis described under tax separation and indemnification agreement with alliant energy above 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of a purchase transaction  we agreed to share with the seller of the actual price received for certain crude oil production in excess of per barrel 
the agreement runs through december  and contains a price escalation per year 
as a result  the sharing amount at january  increased to of the actual price received in excess of per barrel 
as of december   approximately  net barrels of crude oil per month of december estimated net crude oil production are subject to this sharing agreement 
the terms of the agreement do not provide for a maximum amount to be paid 
during the years  and  we paid million  million and million  respectively  under this agreement 
as of december   we have accrued an additional  as currently payable 
new accounting policies in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in sfas as originally issued and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
sfas r is effective for interim reporting period that begins after june  the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of financial condition and results of operation is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances  weather  politics  global economics  mechanical problems  general business conditions and other factors 
our significant accounting policies are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
revenue recognition 
we predominantly derive our revenue from the sale of produced crude oil and natural gas 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received  however  differences have been insignificant 
hedging 
our crude oil and natural gas hedges are designed to be treated as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity 
this policy is significant since it impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
under this pronouncement  the majority of our hedging gains or losses are recorded in the month the contracts settle 
we reflect this as an adjustment to revenue through the loss on oil and gas hedging activities line item in our consolidated income statements 
if our hedges did not qualify for cash flow hedge treatment  then our consolidated income statements could include large non cash fluctuations in this line item  particularly in volatile pricing environments  as our contracts are marked to their period end market values 
successful efforts accounting 
we account for our oil and natural gas operations using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  all costs associated with property acquisition  successful exploratory wells and all development wells are capitalized 
items charged to expense generally include geological and geophysical costs  costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells and oil and natural gas production costs 
except for one small property in canada  all of our properties are located within the continental united states and the gulf of mexico 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities 
reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion  impairment of our oil and natural gas properties  and our long term production participation plan liability 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserve quantities and future cash flows included in this report are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec and fasb 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates 
our proved reserve information included in this report is based on estimates prepared by ryder scott company  cawley  gillespie associates  inc and ra lenser associates  inc  each independent petroleum engineers  and our engineering staff 
the independent petroleum engineers evaluated approximately of the pre tax pv value of our proved reserves as of january  and our engineering staff evaluated the remainder 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ substantially from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
we continually make revisions to reserve estimates throughout the year as additional information becomes available 
we make changes to depletion rates and impairment calculations in the same period that changes to the reserve estimates are made 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties 
we review the value of our oil and natural gas properties whenever management judges that events and circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be recoverable 
we provide for impairments on undeveloped property when we determine that the property will not be developed or a permanent impairment in value has occurred 
impairments of proved producing properties are calculated by comparing future net undiscounted cash flows on a field by field basis using escalated prices to the net recorded book cost at the end of each period 
if the net capitalized cost exceeds net future cash flows  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using net discounted future cash flows from the producing property 
different pricing assumptions or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment 
production participation plan 
we have a production participation plan for all employees 
on an annual basis  interests in oil and gas properties acquired or developed during the year are allocated to the plan on a discretionary basis 
once allocated  the interests not legally conveyed are fixed 
the short term obligation related to the production participation plan is included in the accrued employee benefits line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
this obligation is based on cash flows during the preceding year and is paid annually in cash after year end 
the calculation of this liability depends in part on our estimates of accrued revenues and costs as of the end of each reporting period as discussed above under revenue recognition 
the long term obligation related to the production participation plan is the production participation plan liability line item on the consolidated balance sheet 
this liability is derived primarily from discounted reserve report estimates  which as discussed above  are subject to revision as more information becomes available 
variances between estimates used to calculate liabilities related to the production participation plan and actual sales  cost and reserve data are integrated into the liability calculations in the period identified 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the carrying amount in our financial statements 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is settled 
since our tax returns are filed after the financial statements are prepared  estimates are required in valuing tax assets and liabilities 
we record adjustments to actual in the period we file our tax returns 
effects of inflation and pricing we experienced increased costs during  and due to increased demand for oil field products and services 
the oil and natural gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry put extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs 
material changes in prices impact the current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans and value of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase  continued high prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the cost of material  services and personnel 
acquisition of green river basin properties on february   we announced that we had entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire operated interests in five producing gas fields in the green river basin of wyoming 
the purchase price will be million  or per mcfe  for estimated proved reserves of bcfe 
we will operate approximately of the net daily production from the properties which is currently mmcfe d 
the purchase and sale agreement is subject to standard conditions to closing  including our completion of title and environmental due diligence  with closing expected by the end of march the acquisition will be funded under our credit agreement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
based on production  our income before income taxes for would have moved up or down approximately million for every change in natural gas prices and approximately million for each change in crude oil prices 
we periodically enter into derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
our derivative contracts have traditionally been with no cost collars  although we evaluate other forms of derivative instruments as well 
our derivative contracts have historically qualified for cash flow hedge accounting under sfas no 
this accounting treatment allows the aggregate change in fair market value to be recorded as other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet 
recognition in the consolidated income statement occurs in the period of contract settlement 
we have met the requirement under our credit agreement to hedge at least  but not more than  of our total forecasted pdp production for the period november  through december  in the form of costless collars or fixed price swaps with a minimum floor price of per barrel of oil or per mmbtu 
after december   the credit agreement will not require us to hedge any of our production  but will continue to limit our hedging to a maximum of of our forecasted pdp production 
we also seek to diversify our hedge position with various counterparties where we have clear indications of their current financial strength 
our outstanding hedges as of february  are summarized below commodity period monthly volume mmbtu bbl nymex floor ceiling natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas natural gas crude oil crude oil crude oil crude oil crude oil crude oil crude oil crude oil crude oil to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to  the collared hedges shown above have the effect of providing a protective floor while allowing us to share in upward pricing movements 
consequently  while these hedges are designed to decrease our exposure to price decreases  they also have the effect of limiting the benefit of price increases beyond the ceiling 
for the natural gas contracts listed above  a hypothetical change in the nymex price above the ceiling price or below the floor price applied to the notional amounts would cause a change in the gain loss on hedging activities of  for for the crude oil contracts listed above  a hypothetical change in the nymex price would cause a change in the gain loss on hedging activities of million for we have also entered into fixed price marketing contracts directly with end users for a portion of the natural gas we produce in michigan 
all of those contracts have built in pricing escalators of per year 
our outstanding fixed price marketing contracts at february  are summarized below commodity period monthly volume mmbtu price per mmbtu natural gas natural gas to to  the table below summarizes the hedges and fixed price marketing contracts described above hedges and contracts summary hedged and contracted mmbtu bbl per month as a percentage of december production gas oil january march april june july september october december january march  interest rate risk market risk is estimated as the change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rate on the outstanding balance under our credit agreement 
our credit agreement allows us to fix the interest rate for all or a portion of the principal balance for a period up to six months 
to the extent the interest rate is fixed  interest rate changes affect the instrument s fair market value but do not impact results of operations or cash flows 
conversely  for the portion of the credit agreement that has a floating interest rate  interest rate changes will not affect the fair market value but will impact future results of operations and cash flows 
at december   our outstanding principal balance under our credit agreement was million and the interest rate on the entire outstanding principal balance was fixed at through january  we subsequently fixed the interest rate on the entire outstanding principal balance at through april  at december   the carrying amount approximated fair market value 
assuming a constant debt level of million  the cash flow impact for resulting from a basis point change in interest rates during periods when the interest rate is not fixed would be million 
interest rate swap in august  we entered into an interest rate swap contract to hedge the fair value of million of our senior subordinated notes due because this swap meets the conditions to qualify for the short cut method of assessing effectiveness under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the change in fair value of the debt is assumed to equal the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap 
as such  there is no ineffectiveness assumed to exist between the interest rate swap and the notes 
the interest rate swap is a fixed for floating swap in that we receive the fixed rate of and pay the floating rate 
the floating rate is redetermined every six months based on the libor rate in effect at the contractual reset date 
when libor plus our margin of is less than  we receive a payment from the counterparty equal to the difference in rate times million for the six month period 
when libor plus our margin of is greater than  we pay the counterparty an amount equal to the difference in rate times million for the six month period 
as of december   we have recorded a long term derivative asset of million related to the interest rate swap  which has been designated as a fair value hedge  with a corresponding debt increase
