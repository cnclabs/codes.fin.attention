item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we are one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states and are engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airports  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
we have offices in alaska  arizona  california  florida  georgia  minnesota  nevada  new york  oregon  texas  utah and washington 
our business involves two operating segments the branch division and the heavy construction division 
our contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies and private parties and to a lesser extent through negotiation with private parties 
our bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period 
the two primary economic drivers of our business are federal  state and local public funding levels and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and locally 
the level of demand for our services will have a direct correlation to these drivers 
for example  a weak economy will generally result in a reduced demand for construction in the private sector 
this reduced demand increases competition for fewer private sector projects and will ultimately also increase competition in the public sector as companies migrate from bidding on the scarce private sector work to projects in the public sector 
a weak economy also tends to produce less tax revenue to the public sector that can have the effect of decreasing the funds available for spending on infrastructure improvements 
there are funding sources that have been specifically earmarked for infrastructure spending  such as gasoline taxes  which are not necessarily directly impacted by a weak economy 
however  even these funds can be temporarily at risk as state and local governments struggle to balance their budgets 
greater competition can reduce revenue growth and or increase pressure on gross profit margins 
conversely  higher public funding and or a robust economy will increase demand for our services and provide opportunities for revenue growth and margin improvement 
our general and administrative costs include salaries and related expenses  incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation  as well as other overhead costs to support our overall business 
in general  these costs will increase in response to the growth and the related increased complexity of our business 
these costs may also vary depending on the number of projects in process in a particular area and the corresponding level of estimating activity 
for example  as large projects are completed or if the level of work slows down in a particular area  we will often re assign employees who had been working on projects to estimating and bidding activities until another project is ready to start  which temporarily moves their salaries and other related costs from cost of revenue to general and administrative expense 
additionally  our compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
the cash portion of these incentives is expensed when earned while the restricted stock portion is expensed over the vesting period of the stock generally three to five years 
depending on the mix of cash and restricted stock  these incentives can have the effect of increasing general and administrative expenses in a very profitable year and decreasing expenses in less profitable years 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies and estimates require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from construction contracts  accounting for 
table of contents construction joint ventures  the valuation of long lived assets and insurance estimates 
we evaluate all of our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
revenue recognition for construction contracts the majority of our contracts with our customers are either fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or cubic yards of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  faulty estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk that we may not be able to perform all the work profitably for the specified contract amount 
the percentage of fixed price contracts in our backlog has increased from approximately at december  to approximately at december  all state and federal government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the party contracting with us  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures  are recognized on the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related profit is deferred until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
it is our judgment that until a project reaches completion  there is insufficient information to determine what the estimated profit on the project will be with a reasonable level of assurance 
revenue from contract claims is recognized when we have a signed settlement agreement and payment is assured 
revenue from contract change orders  which occur in most large projects  is recognized when the owner has agreed to the change order in writing 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the threshold is applied to all percentage of completion projects without exception unless and until we project a loss on the project  in which case the estimated loss is immediately recognized 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
our cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a highly detailed bottom up approach and we believe our experience allows us to produce materially reliable estimates 
however  our projects can be highly complex and in almost every case the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have many projects of varying levels of complexity and size in process at any given time during we worked on over  projects these changes in estimates can offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates  particularly in the bigger  more complex projects in our heavy construction division  can have a more significant effect on profitability 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  recognition of costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due to owner and weather delays  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity expectations  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and a change in the availability and proximity of materials 
the foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at 
table of contents different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
construction joint ventures and other variable interest entities as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation under joint ventures  we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise  risk and resources for certain highly complex projects 
we have determined that certain of the construction joint ventures as well as certain other partnerships in which we participate are variable interest entities as defined by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
revised december consolidation of variable interest entities fin and we have consolidated those for which we are the primary beneficiary on a prospective basis effective january  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
consistent with industry practice and emerging issues task force issue  investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures  we account for our share of the operations of construction joint ventures in which we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary on a pro rata basis in the consolidated statements of income and as a single line item in the consolidated balance sheets 
determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie and whether we are the primary beneficiary involves a substantial amount of estimation and judgment  including estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows 
although we believe that the estimates and judgments we used are reasonable and supportable  the use of different assumptions and estimates could produce a different result 
the decision as to whether or not to consolidate a joint venture has an impact on the amount of recorded revenue  contract costs  assets and liabilities but has little or no impact on recorded net income 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management and this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
additionally  we had approximately million in goodwill at december   million relating to hcd and million relating to our branch division 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and more frequently when events and circumstances occur that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is recorded using a discounted future cash flow method 
we then compare the resulting fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we would measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize a goodwill impairment loss 
we performed our annual impairment test in and we determined that no impairment had occurred 
the discounted future cash flow method used in the first step of our impairment test involves significant estimates including future cash inflows from estimated revenues  future cash outflows from estimated project cost and general and administrative costs  estimates of timing of collection and payment of various items and future growth rates as well as discount rate and terminal value assumptions 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions that we used in testing for impairment are reasonable and supportable  significant changes in any one of these assumptions could produce a significantly different result 

table of contents current year revenue years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent in thousands revenue by division branch division heavy construction division revenue by geographic area california west excluding california midwest south northeast revenue by market sector federal agencies state agencies local public agencies total public sector private sector material sales revenue revenue from our branch division increased million  or  in the year ended december  from the year ended december  the increase in branch division revenue primarily reflected increases in private sector construction revenue and sales of construction materials as a result of the increase in demand created by the continuing strong housing market in california and other branch division locations 
the increase in revenue from construction materials was also due to increases in both unit volume and average sales price of certain products  which we believe reflect an appreciation in the market for the growing scarcity of finite aggregate resources and the results of our strategic focus on maximizing revenue from external sales of materials 
public sector revenue as a percent of total branch revenue remained relatively unchanged compared with as increased local government agency revenue was largely offset by a reduction in state government agency work  particularly in california 
we continue to experience reduced awards from the california state department of transportation due to ongoing budgetary uncertainty in the state see outlook 
revenue from our heavy construction division increased million  or  in the year ended december  from the year ended december  included in hcd revenue for the year ended december  was million all in the public sector resulting from the consolidation of our partners share of construction joint venture revenue under fin see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the remainder of the increase resulted from new awards in california and in the south  partially offset by a reduction in the northeast and reflected changes primarily in public sector backlog 
additions to hcd backlog in the fourth quarter of included a million design build bridge project in florida  a million highway project in texas and a million transit structure project in new york 
branch division backlog at december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the december  level 
the increase was due primarily to higher backlog in the private sector for projects located throughout the west  including california  due largely to the continued strong demand in the housing sector 
public sector backlog increases in states other than california were generally offset by a decrease in california  where ongoing budgetary issues have had a negative impact on the amount of funding available for infrastructure projects 
branch division awards in the fourth quarter of included a million bridge project in alaska and a million sewer pipeline project in california 

table of contents gross profit years ended december  in thousands branch division gross profit percent of division revenue heavy construction division gross profit percent of division revenue other total gross profit percent of revenue gross profit as more fully described under critical accounting estimates we recognize revenue only equal to cost  deferring profit recognition  until a project reaches completion 
because we have a large number of projects at various stages of completion in our branch division  this policy generally has very little impact on the branch division s gross profit on a quarterly or annual basis 
however  hcd has fewer projects in process at any given time and those projects tend to be much larger than branch division projects 
as a result  hcd gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary significantly in periods where one or several very large projects reach completion and the deferred profit is recognized or conversely  in periods where backlog is growing rapidly and a higher percentage of projects are in their early stages with no associated gross margin recognition 
additionally  as we also describe under critical accounting estimates we do not recognize revenue from contract claims until we have a signed agreement and payment is assured and we do not recognize revenue from contract change orders until the contract owner has agreed to the change order in writing 
however  we do recognize the costs related to any contract claims or pending change orders when they are incurred 
as a result  our gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary during periods where a large volume of change orders or contract claims are pending resolution reducing gross profit percent or  conversely  during periods where large change orders or contract claims are agreed or settled increasing gross profit percent 
although this variability can occur in both our branch division and hcd  it can be much more pronounced in hcd because of the larger size of their projects 
revenue from projects that were less than complete was million in and million in included in revenue from projects less than complete for the year ended december  is million resulting from the consolidation of our partners share of construction joint venture backlog under fin see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this increase in revenue from projects less than complete had the effect of reducing our overall gross margin 
no significant claim revenue was recognized in either or gross profit as a percent of revenue in our branch division decreased slightly in as compared with reflecting normal variability in the mix of work performed during the year 
the decrease in hcd gross profit as a percent of revenue in as compared with was due primarily to downward revisions in certain profit forecasts due to additional estimated costs to complete 
the net impact of these estimate changes on recognized gross profit during was a reduction in gross profit of approximately million  of which approximately million was recognized in the fourth quarter 
included in the net impact of this change in estimate in both the quarter and year ended december  was approximately million representing our partners proportionate share that has been newly consolidated during see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the majority of this change in estimate related to downward revisions of ten projects 
the amount attributable to each project ranged from approximately million to million 
the cost estimate changes resulted from a variety of factors including costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due to owner and weather delays  design problems on design build projects  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity 
table of contents expectations and higher estimated liquidated damages on two projects 
at december   six of these projects were greater than complete  two were greater than complete and the remaining two projects averaged complete 
although we believe that our estimates of the cost to complete these projects are achievable  it is possible that the actual cost to complete will be greater than our current estimate and any future estimate changes could be significant 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  in thousands salaries and related expenses incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation other general and administrative expenses total percent of revenue general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million from to salaries and related expenses increased in due primarily to additional staffing needed to support a higher volume of work 
incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation decreased in due to lower profitability in the increase in other general administrative costs in related to increased bidding activity and higher revenue volume as well as costs associated with complying with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of other general and administrative costs include information technology  occupancy  office equipment and supplies  depreciation  travel and entertainment  outside services  advertising and marketing  training and other miscellaneous expenses  none of which individually exceeded of total general and administrative expenses

table of contents provision for income taxes years ended december  in thousands provision for income taxes effective tax rate provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased to in from in due primarily to the inclusion in our pre tax income of the minority interest in the income of our consolidated construction joint ventures as required by fin see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are generally not subject to income taxes on a stand alone basis  and a lower overall state tax rate  net of federal tax benefit  due to changes in the mix of earnings in differing tax jurisdictions 
the american jobs creation act of provides for a new deduction for domestic production which will be phased in over six years beginning in as a result  we expect that our tax expense will be positively impacted by this deduction  adjusting our effective tax rate between and 
outlook looking ahead  our performance in will be dependent largely on the branch division s ability to capitalize on the private sector opportunities available in the west and hcd s ability to deliver improved performance from its backlog 
our materials business remains strong  and we continue to monitor the legislative activities affecting our industry  particularly the funding of transportation projects at both federal  state and local levels 
the branch division has been implementing its strategic direction taken several years ago to capitalize on the healthy private sector market in the west 
we have made the organizational adjustments and added staff to allow us to better serve this market  particularly in california where we continue to witness population and job growth producing strong housing starts in many of our regions 
we have yet  however  to see an increase in caltrans work being let and we do not anticipate this will change in conversely  the private sector market is currently showing no signs of slowing down 
our strategy for the branch division is to continue to serve both the private and public sector markets 
this strategy provides us the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities in a variety of markets and economic environments 
our materials business  which is also being driven by the private sector market  remains strong 
with third party sales representing of the branch division s revenue in  the ownership of aggregate materials is becoming increasingly more valuable both as a resource for our core construction business as well as a strategic and profitable retail business 
our plan is to continue to invest in this part of our business by acquiring additional aggregate reserves  green fielding new facilities and expanding our existing operations 
our financial resources provide us with the ability to take advantage of these investment opportunities as they arise 
our focus for all of our business  but particularly for our hcd business  is to successfully execute on our backlog 
we believe the division s margin performance has  in part  been impacted by its rapid growth and  as a result we are continuing to build the division s support infrastructure and are focusing considerable attention on the basic fundamentals of this business beginning with management oversight  a disciplined bidding philosophy and a commitment to project execution and forecasting 
specifically  we have been bidding our work with higher margins and spending less effort on the top line growth of the division 
in addition  over this past year  we have added a second assistant division manager  added two new regional managers and added support staff as well as instituting new procedures to surface problems sooner 
while we have some underperforming projects yet to complete  we believe we will begin to see our efforts reflected in improved financial results from the division in on the legislative front  we continue to closely monitor congress on going efforts to reauthorize the federal transportation bill that replaces the previous legislation the six year billion transportation equity act for the st century that expired in september the president s fy budget released in 
table of contents early february included a revised funding proposal of billion over six years a billion increase over the billion proposed by the administration in the fy budget 
according to the american road and transportation builders association artba  this increase is paid for through new revenue from the highway trust fund htf generated by the credit of ethanol related tax subsidies to the htf and from a reduction in fuel tax evasion 
subsequently  the house introduced its billion six year bill for fy through fy that is expected to go before the full house for a vote in march 
according to legislative analysts with artba  the senate is expected to introduce a similar measure by early march 
we are working closely with industry organizations and lobbyists to support a long term bill this year that provides for more than the minimum investment levels proposed by the president and the house 
as anticipated  in california  governor schwarzenegger proposed no additional transportation funding in his initial budget submission and called for an additional loan of billion from proposition monies to the general fund to help mitigate the state s fiscal shortfall 
the general fund currently owes more than billion to transportation accounts to be paid back in future years 
the budget picture will become clearer with the governor s may revisions and the actions of the legislature in framing a final budget document 
the governor and legislative leaders in both houses have proposed constitutional firewalls to protect proposition funds in future fiscal years 
as we discussed last quarter  the defeat of two california gaming initiatives  proposition and  on last november s ballot were expected to boost the state s transportation accounts by as much as billion 
originally  these funds were to be made available during the first half of  provided litigation was resolved and the bonds were let 
according to industry analysts  while the governor remains strongly committed to ensuring that transportation programs will benefit from the sale of bonds  the recently proposed state budget anticipates that legal issues will prevent the sale of those bonds in by proposing to shift the bond proceeds to the budget 
additionally  state treasurer phil angelides has estimated that the bonds will yield only two thirds of the billion originally projected 
in summary  we expect to build our capabilities across both divisions in and pursue opportunities in new and existing markets throughout the united states 
as always  our top priorities remain the safe and successful execution of our work and the improvement of our bottom line financial performance 
prior years revenue revenue from our branch division decreased million  or  in the year ended december  from the year ended december  branch division revenue in included million from our majority owned wilder construction company wilder subsidiary  which was consolidated in our financial statements beginning in may  versus million in the decrease in branch division revenue reflected a decrease in construction revenue  primarily in the public sector  partially offset by the increase in wilder revenue referred to above and an increase in revenue from the sale of construction materials 
many of our branch division businesses were impacted by the effects of a weaker general economy and uncertainty surrounding public funding  particularly in california 
the increase in revenue from construction materials was due to increases in both unit volume and average sales price of certain products  which we believe reflected an appreciation in the market for the growing scarcity of finite aggregate resources and the results of a strategic focus on maximizing revenue from external sales of materials 
revenue from our heavy construction division increased million  or  in the year ended december  from the year ended december  due primarily to results from a higher backlog at the beginning of geographically  this revenue growth came from projects in the south and from our granite halmar location in new york 
backlog backlog in our heavy construction division at december  was  million  an increase of million  or  from the december  level 
the increase took place primarily in the south and at our granite halmar location in new york and reflected increases in both public sector and private sector backlog 
additions to hcd backlog in the fourth quarter of included a million 
table of contents interchange project in florida  a million roadway and bridge project in florida and a million transit facility project in new york 
branch division backlog at december  was million  a decrease of million or from the december  level 
the decrease was due primarily to lower backlog in the public sector  particularly in california where the continuing budget crisis had a negative impact on the amount of funding available for infrastructure projects 
branch division awards in the fourth quarter of include a million share of a joint venture highway improvement project in nevada and a million highway reconstruction project in utah 
gross profit revenue from projects that were less than complete was million in and million in because the variance between the two years was not significant  the impact on the comparability of gross profit as a percent of revenue between the two years was also not significant 
no significant claim revenue was recognized in either or gross profit as a percent of revenue in our branch division increased slightly in as compared with this was due to an increase in the profitability of sales of construction materials  partially offset by lower gross profit margin on the division s construction work 
construction gross margins in the branch division were under pressure due to increased competition resulting from reductions in various state and local transportation funding programs  however the margins on the sale of materials benefited from a higher average sales price 
gross profit as a percent of revenue in hcd decreased in as compared with due largely to profit forecasts on several projects that were revised downward to give recognition to additional estimated costs to complete for which we either did not expect to receive additional revenue or we had not yet reached agreement with the contract owner for additional revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million from to this increase was primarily attributed to expenses from our wilder subsidiary and our expansion into northern california  both of which were first reflected in our costs in may excluding the wilder and northern california locations added in may of  salaries and related expenses increased by approximately million in incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation increased in as compared with due to higher net income in other general and administrative costs include information technology  occupancy  office equipment and supplies  depreciation  travel and entertainment  outside services  advertising and marketing  training and other miscellaneous expenses  none of which individually exceeded of total general and administrative expenses 
operating income our heavy construction division s contribution to operating income increased in compared with due primarily to increased revenue as described in revenue above 
branch division contribution to operating income decreased in compared with due to lower revenue as described in revenue above and higher general and administrative expenses due primarily to expenses from our wilder subsidiary and our expansion into northern california  both of which were first reflected in our costs in may unallocated other corporate expenses principally comprise corporate general and administrative expenses 
other income expense included in equity in income of affiliates in is million recognized in the first quarter of related to the sale of the state route toll road franchise by the california private transportation corporation cptc  of which we are a limited partner  as well as a gain of approximately million recognized on the sale of a portion of our investment in tic holdings  inc tic 
interest income decreased in  largely due to the absence of the recognition of deferred interest income on a note receivable from cptc in and lower look back interest income related to taxes paid on income from construction projects 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by used in by operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures working capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we expect the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  acquisitions and other investments 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in  which includes amounts for construction equipment  aggregate and asphalt plants  buildings  leasehold improvements and the purchase of land and aggregate reserves 
additionally  we are seeking authorization  subject to board approval  to spend up to approximately million for materials related investments 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities totaled million at december  and included million of cash from our newly consolidated joint ventures see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this joint venture cash is for the working capital needs of each joint venture s project 
the decision to distribute cash must generally be made jointly by all of the partners 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  financial commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through the next months and beyond 
if we experience a significant change in our business such as the execution of a significant acquisition  we would likely need to acquire additional sources of financing  which may be limited by the terms of our existing debt covenants  or may require the amendment of our existing debt agreements 
cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  represents a million increase from the amount provided by operating activities in the increase primarily reflects variations based on the amount and progress of work being performed 
in particular  there was a higher growth in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities related primarily to a higher volume of work performed in the fourth quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of that was only partially offset by a higher growth in accounts receivable 
additionally  there was a decrease in the cash flow from net billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings due to an increase in the number of projects with billing provisions that require completion of discrete components of work rather than the more typical monthly unit price billing terms 
such billing provisions result in delays in our ability to bill and receive payment from the project owner 
cash used by investing activities of million in represents an million increase from the amount used in investing activities in the increase was largely due to higher net additions to property and equipment as well as million used to purchase additional shares of our majority owned subsidiary  wilder construction company  in april these increases in cash used by investing activities were partially offset by higher net maturities of marketable securities 
cash used by financing activities was million in  a decrease of million from the decrease was mainly due to higher proceeds from long term debt in  which include million advanced under our bank revolving line of credit  partially offset by higher payments of long term debt and net distributions of million to our partners in our construction joint ventures which we began consolidating in as a result of our implementation of fin see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the years of expected payment for redemptions is based on estimates and is subject to change 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock of which million remained at december  in addition  we are authorized to purchase shares for contribution to our employee stock ownership plan esop 
we had standby letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding at december   all of which expire between february and october of additionally  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security under certain public and private sector contracts 
at december   approximately billion of our backlog was bonded and performance bonds totaling approximately billion were outstanding 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are generally released from the bonds when each contract is accepted by the owner 
the ability to maintain bonding capacity to support our current and future level of contracting requires that we maintain cash and working capital balances satisfactory to our sureties 
in addition to our working capital and cash generated from operations  we currently have access to funds under a million bank revolving line of credit  which allows for unsecured borrowings through june   with interest rate options 
outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit are at our choice of selected libor rates plus a margin that is recalculated quarterly 
the margin was at december  the unused and available portion of this line of credit was million at december  additionally  our wilder subsidiary has a bank revolving line of credit of million that expires in june there were no amounts outstanding under the wilder line of credit at december  restrictive covenants under the terms of our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and the maintenance of tangible net worth as defined see note of the notes to the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  additionally  our wilder subsidiary has restrictive covenants on a wilder stand alone basis under the terms of its debt agreements that include the maintenance of certain ratios of working capital  liabilities to net worth and tangible net worth and restricts wilder capital expenditures in excess of specified limits 
wilder was in compliance with these covenants at december  failure to comply with these covenants could cause the amounts due under the debt agreements to become currently payable 
joint ventures we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise  risk and resources for certain highly complex projects 
generally  each construction joint venture is formed to accomplish a specific project  is jointly controlled by the joint venture partners and is dissolved upon completion of the project 
we select our joint venture partners based on our analysis of the prospective venturers construction and financial capabilities  expertise in the type of work to be performed and past working relationships with us  among other criteria 
the joint venture agreements typically provide that our interests in any profits and assets  and our respective share in any losses and liabilities that may result from the performance of the contract are limited to our stated percentage interest in the project 
the venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability among the joint venture partners 
our agreements with our joint venture partners provide that each party will assume and pay its full proportionate share of any losses resulting from a project  however  if one of our partners is unable to pay its proportionate share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
under each joint venture agreement  one partner is designated as the sponsor 
the sponsoring partner typically provides all administrative  accounting and most of the project management support for the project and generally receives a fee from the joint venture for these services 
we have been designated as the sponsoring partner in certain of our current joint venture projects and are a non sponsoring partner in others 
we also participate in various line item joint venture agreements under which each partner is responsible for performing certain discrete items of the total scope of contracted work 
the revenue for these discrete items is defined in the contract with the project owner and each venture partner bears the profitability risk associated with its own work 
all partners in a line item joint venture are jointly and severally liable for completion of the total project under the terms of the contract with the project owner 
there is not a single set of books and records for a line item joint venture 
each partner accounts for its items of work individually as it would for any self performed contract 
we account for our portion of these contracts as a project in our accounting system and include receivables and payables associated with our work on our balance sheet 
although our agreements with our joint venture partners for both construction joint ventures and line item joint ventures provide that each party will assume and pay its share of any losses resulting from a project  if one of our partners was unable to pay its share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
at december  approximately million of work representing either our partners proportionate share or work that our partners are directly responsible for in line item joint ventures  had yet to be completed 
we have never incurred a loss under these joint and several liability provisions  however  it is possible that we could in the future and such a loss could be significant

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks due largely to changes in interest rates  which we have managed primarily by managing the maturities in our investment portfolio 
we currently do not have any material business transactions in foreign currencies 
the fair value of our short term held to maturity investment portfolio and related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
the fair value of our long term held to maturity investment portfolio may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
our mutual fund portfolio of million is exposed to equity price risks 
we had senior notes payable of million at december  which carry a fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in nine equal annual installments that began in and senior notes payable of million at december  which carry a fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in nine equal annual installments beginning in we had amounts due under our line of credit totaling million at december  which bear interest at month libor plus a margin of 
the interest rate resets every six months and all amounts outstanding are due in june at december  million of the outstanding amount bore interest at and the remaining million bore interest at 
in february  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements in order to gain access to the lower borrowing rates normally available on floating rate debt  while avoiding the prepayment and other costs that would be associated with refinancing our long term fixed rate debt 
the swaps purchased have a combined notional amount of million  a thirty month term with six month settlement periods and provide for us to pay variable interest at libor plus set rate spreads and receive fixed interest of between and 
the notional amount does not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities  but rather  is used in the determination of cash settlement under the swap agreement 
as a result of purchasing these swaps  we are exposed to credit losses from any counter party non performance  however  we do not anticipate any such losses from these agreements  which are with a major financial institution 
the agreements also expose us to interest rate risk should libor rise during the term of the agreements 
these swap agreements are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no

under the provisions of sfas  we initially recorded the interest rate swaps at fair value  and subsequently recorded any changes in fair value in other income  net

the estimated fair value of our long term held to maturity investments approximates the principal amounts above due to the relatively minor difference between the effective yields of these investments and rates currently available on similar instruments 
rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt 
based on the lower fixed borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities  the fair value of the senior notes payable was approximately million as of december  and million as of december  the estimated fair value of amounts payable under our revolving line of credit at december  approximates the principal amount reflected above since the variable interest rate approximates the rate currently available to us for a loan with similar terms
