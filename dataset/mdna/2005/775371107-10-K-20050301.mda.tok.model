we are a global specialty materials company that brings technology and innovation to the market to enhance the performance of end use consumer products made by our customers 
our salt business is one of the most recognizable brand names in the world 
our products are sold primarily for use in the construction and building  electronics  household products and personal care  packaging and food  and automotive markets 
we operate six reportable operating segments coatings  performance chemicals  monomers  electronic materials  adhesives and sealants  and salt 

table of contents a year in review our performance this year was an improvement over as the overall economic recovery helped bolster demand across all markets and regions 
our strong portfolio of products and technologies continued to drive growth 
other significant items affecting the results of our operations include the impact of foreign currency translation  and tight supply and escalating raw material and energy prices  and continued selling price improvements 
in  we reported sales of  million  a increase over over of this increase is from organic growth through improved demand and higher selling prices primarily in our coatings  electronic materials  and performance chemicals segments 
the remainder of the increase in sales was largely due to the impact of favorable foreign currencies 
we reported earnings from continuing operations in of million  or per share  as compared to earnings from continuing operations of million or per share  reflecting the impact of higher demand  higher pricing  lower restructuring and impairment charges and favorable currencies 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements when the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment  and if different estimates and assumptions were used  the result could have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
those estimates critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are listed below 
litigation and environmental reserves we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business including personal injury  property damage and environmental litigation 
additionally  we are involved in environmental remediation and spend significant amounts for both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to assess these matters to determine if a liability is probable  and record such a liability when the financial exposure can be reasonably estimated 
the determination and estimation of these liabilities are critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
in reviewing such matters  we consider a broad range of information  including the claims  demands  settlement offers received from governmental authorities or private parties  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute and our prior experience  to determine if a liability is probable and if the value is estimable 
if both of these conditions are met  we record a liability 
if we believe that no best estimate exists  we accrue the minimum in a range of possible losses  and disclose any material reasonably possible additional losses 
if we determine a liability to be only reasonably possible  we consider the same information to estimate the possible exposure and disclose the potential liability 
our most significant reserves have been established for remediation and restoration costs associated with environmental damage 
as of december   we have million reserved for environmental related costs 
we conduct studies and site surveys to determine the extent of environmental damage and necessary remediation 
with the expertise of our environmental engineers and legal counsel  we determine our best estimates for remediation and restoration costs 
these estimates are based on forecasts of future costs for remediation and change 
table of contents periodically as additional and better information becomes available 
changes to assumptions and considerations used to calculate remediation reserves could materially affect our results of operations 
if we determine that the scope of remediation is broader than originally planned  discover new contamination  discover previously unknown sites or become subject to related personal injury or property damage claims  our estimates and assumptions could materially change 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate reserves for both our environmental and other legal liabilities are appropriate 
these estimates are based in large part on information currently available and the current laws and regulations governing these matters 
if additional information becomes available or there are changes to the laws or regulations or actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in estimating our reserves  the resulting change could have a material impact on the results of our operations  financial position or cash flows 
income taxes the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in the determination of our current year tax provision  we assume that substantially all of the foreign earnings are remitted to the united states and since  upon remittance  such earnings are taxable  we provide federal income taxes on income from our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit within these jurisdictions 
we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits 
we adjust these accruals  if necessary  upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 
since significant judgment is required to assess the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  we consider such estimates to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the current year effective and deferred tax positions are appropriate 
however  if the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
a change in the effective tax rate would change the annual income tax expense by million 
restructuring when appropriate  we record charges relating to efforts to strategically reposition our manufacturing footprint and support service functions 
in the past three years  we recorded a net million  million and million in  and  respectively  for severance and other employee benefits within the provision for restructuring and asset impairments in the consolidated statements of operations 
reserves are established for such initiatives by calculating our best estimate of employee termination costs utilizing detailed restructuring plans approved by management 
reserve calculations are based upon various factors including an employee s length of service  contract provisions  salary level and health care benefit choices 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to calculate these restructuring provisions are appropriate  and although significant changes are not anticipated  actual costs could differ from the assumptions and considerations used in estimating reserves should changes be made in the nature or timing of our restructuring plans 
the resulting change could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
long lived assets our long lived assets include land  buildings  equipment  long term investments  goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other intangible assets 
long lived assets  other than investments  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in addition  changes in the expected useful life of these long lived assets may also be an impairment indicator 
as a result  future decisions to change our manufacturing footprint or exit certain businesses could result in material impairment charges 

table of contents when such events or changes occur  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the asset use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the assets 
the key variables that we must estimate include assumptions regarding sales volume  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic factors 
these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
for this reason  we consider our estimates to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated statements of operations 
if such assets are considered impaired  they are written down to fair value as appropriate 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to test for recoverability  we typically utilize discounted estimated future cash flows to measure fair value for each reporting unit 
this calculation is highly sensitive to both the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit and the discount rate assumed in these calculations 
these components are discussed below estimated future cash flows the key variables that we must estimate to determine future cash flows include assumptions for sales volume  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic or market related factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
for example  unanticipated changes in competition  customer sourcing requirements and product maturity would all have a significant impact on these estimates 
discount rate we employ a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determining our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing 
our wacc calculation includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company and therefore beyond our control 
the average wacc utilized in our goodwill recoverability testing for and was and  respectively 
a change in the wacc will result in an approximate change in the computed fair value of our reporting units 
the following table summarizes the major factors that influence the rate risk free rate of return cost of debt market risk premium the change in risk free rate of return is due to the overall increase in the us interest rates between the dates of our annual impairment testing in may and may in  we reduced our estimate of the market risk premium to reflect management s best estimate of its cost of capital 
the reduction is consistent with market risk premiums used in our other financial estimates 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used in the above estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
based on the results of the annual impairment test in  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets of our automotive coatings  adhesives and sealants  salt  and certain process chemicals reporting units had fair values only slightly in excess of the book value of their net assets 
accordingly  even a small adverse change in the estimated future cash flows for these businesses or increases in the wacc rate could result in the fair value falling below the book value of their net assets 
this could result in material impairment charges 
the fair values of our long term investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest  as well as volatility inherent in their external markets 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we will consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of its investment entities 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges 

table of contents pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used to measure plan obligations and related assets of company sponsored defined benefit pension plans  post retirement benefits  post employment benefits eg medical  disability and other employee liabilities 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels  the expected long term rate of return on assets  increases or trends in health care costs and estimated mortality 
we use actuaries to assist us in preparing these calculations and determining these assumptions 
these assumptions involve inherent uncertainties  which may not be controllable by management  and as a result  adjustments to expense may be required in future periods 
we believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate plan obligations and annual expense are appropriate 
however  if the actual outcome differs from our estimates and assumptions  the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of position 
the weighted average discount rate and the estimated return on us plan assets  which constitute the majority of our plan assets  used in our determination of pension expense are as follows weighted average discount rate estimated return on plan assets the following illustrates the annual impact on pension expense of a basis point increase or decrease from the current assumptions

factors contributing to the improvement by segment are reported as follows coatings primarily driven by the impact of higher demand  favorable impact of currencies  and higher selling prices  performance chemicals driven by higher demand across most businesses  the favorable impact of currencies and higher selling prices  electronic materials driven by higher demand for advanced technology product lines in semiconductor technologies and advanced packaging in packaging and finishing technologies  and monomers driven by higher selling prices  increased demand and the favorable impact of currencies 

table of contents net sales from adhesives and sealants and salt accounted for the remaining million in consolidated net sales and are more fully described in the segment section below 
gross profit for was  million  an increase of from  million in  due to the increase in sales 
gross profit margin decreased in to from in due to significantly higher raw material and energy costs which were only partially offset by the benefit of higher demand  the favorable impact of currency  higher selling prices 
in addition  the consolidation of a joint venture previously recorded as an equity method investment also had a favorable impact of approximately basis points on gross profit margin  which is discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we also recorded gains from insurance settlements of million and million in and  respectively 
in  we anticipate raw material and natural gas prices to exceed levels  however  it is difficult to predict the extent and duration of higher prices 
for further information regarding the impact of raw materials on our businesses  please see raw materials on page we are making efforts to mitigate the impact of escalating raw material and energy costs primarily by increasing selling prices  exercising control over discretionary spending  and utilizing swap  option and collar contracts 
we have not yet fully recovered the raw material price increases 
while we cannot predict whether current raw material prices will decrease in the future  we have been somewhat successful at managing the impact through the strategies listed above 
additionally  we will incur higher expenses for employee related benefits  such as wages and pension expense  in overall  we anticipate  our gross margins will remain in the to range 
selling and administrative expense in  selling and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million from million in the increase was primarily due to higher employee related costs  including increased pension expense  normal salary increases  the increasing rate of health care costs and higher stock based compensation expense  the consolidation of a joint venture previously recorded as an equity method investment as a result of fin see note to our consolidated financial statements  the unfavorable impact of currencies primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies versus the us dollar  and higher consulting fees for process reengineering efforts and internal control documentation as part of our efforts to meet compliance rules under the sarbanes oxley act of these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of recent cost savings initiatives 
we believe that our cost savings initiatives will continue to reduce certain administrative costs as we improve efficiencies 
however  we anticipate overall higher employee related costs in as a result of an increase in pension costs due to a combination of the decline in the discount rate and amortization of prior unrecognized losses in accordance with us gaap  normal salary increases  the increasing rate of health care costs  and increased stock based compensation expense for stock option and restricted stock grants  primarily as a result of the increased amortization due to our adoption of fas in and the start of restricted grants to middle management in research and development expense we spent million on research and development costs in  an increase of million or from spending of million 
the increase reflects higher employee related costs and higher project spending  consistent with our plan for  along with the impact of the consolidation of a joint venture previously recorded as an equity method investment 
interest expense interest expense for was million  a increase from million in this increase was primarily the result of higher average us interest rates throughout in addition we recorded lower capitalized interest due to the lower overall capital spending throughout most of amortization of finite lived intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for was million  a decrease from million in the decrease is due to a lower asset base as compared to  resulting primarily from the june impairment of certain finite lived intangible assets 

table of contents share of affiliate earnings  net in  we recorded affiliate net earnings of million  a decrease from million in the decrease was primarily due to the adoption of fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which required the consolidation of a joint venture in  that was previously accounted for as an equity affiliate see note to our consolidated financial statements

in millions severance and employee benefits  net asset impairments  net of gains on sales other  including contract lease termination penalties amount charged to earnings severance and employee benefits in  we recognized a net million of severance and associated employee benefit expense  of which million affecting positions  pertained to initiatives 
the initiatives included million associated with the reorganization of our plastics additives  architectural and functional coatings  adhesives and sealants and electronic materials businesses  and million associated with several smaller reduction in force efforts  primarily associated with our administrative support functions 
these initiatives are designed to reduce redundant costs and reposition our workforce to capitalize on the enhancements made possible by the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
these new initiatives are expected to result in annual savings of approximately million 
offsetting these charges were million of changes to reserves recorded in the current year and million for prior years initiatives 
these changes in estimates are largely related to a reduction in the design and scope of our previously announced north american support services restructuring  as certain business model transformation opportunities did not generate the anticipated benefits  and to a change in estimates for the north american plastics additives initiative announced in the second quarter 
as of december   positions of the identified have been eliminated 
the balance at december   recorded for severance and employee benefits  was included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
asset impairments in  we recognized million in asset impairment charges primarily related to an administrative functions initiative announced in the second quarter 
severance and employee benefits in  we recognized a net million of severance and associated employee benefit expense  of which million  affecting  positions in total pertained to initiatives 
the initiatives included million pertaining to a european restructuring initiative which commenced in the second quarter  million associated with the elimination of positions primarily in our north american support services  such as logistics  human resources  procurement and information technology announced in the fourth quarter  and million associated with several smaller reductions in force initiatives in various businesses throughout the year 
in most cases  separated employees were offered early termination benefits 
the charge is based on actual amounts paid to employees as well as amounts expected to be paid upon termination 
these initiatives were designed to address 
table of contents business and infrastructure inefficiencies  reduce redundant costs and reposition our workforce to capitalize on the enhancements made possible by the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
included in the million charge  is a million increase in expense  comprised of a million reversal of charges recorded in for current year initiatives and a million expense pertaining to initiatives 
changes in estimates are recorded as actual costs are compared to original estimates and reserves are adjusted as expenses are finalized 
the changes to prior year initiatives mostly include settlement losses on pension obligations as individual pension liabilities were settled from the pension plan 
we recognize pension settlement gains or losses at the time an employee s individual liability is settled within the pension plan 
as of december   positions of the  identified had been eliminated 
in  we reduced the total number of positions to be affected by these initiatives by positions 
this reduction is primarily a result of the change in scope of the north american support services restructuring 
the balance at december  recorded for these severance and employee benefits was included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
asset impairments in  we recognized million of net asset impairment charges 
of the total  million was recognized as asset impairment charges recorded to adjust the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value  which was calculated using discounted cash flow analyses 
gains on sales of previously impaired assets offset the total impairment charge by million 
in general  we continue to analyze other efficiency initiatives  including plant closures  manufacturing footprint redesign and organizational restructurings made possible by the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
if approved by management  significant future initiatives could result in material restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we believe that it is possible that additional restructuring activities will be approved during and could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we are currently not able to estimate the impact of these charges although they could be material 
other income  net in  net other income increased to million from million in significant increases in other income includes million of pre tax gains on sales of real estate and an million pre tax gain on the sale of our remaining interest in the european salt business  which we sold in income taxes in  we recorded a provision for income tax expense of million reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective rate from on earnings in is primarily due to lower taxes on foreign earnings 
cumulative effect of accounting change the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  was a required change in accounting principle and the cumulative effect of adopting this standard as of january  resulted in a non cash  after tax charge of million in the first quarter of as a result of the adoption of fin r consolidation of variable interest entities  we consolidated a joint venture as of january  due to the fact that we previously accounted for this joint venture as an equity method investment  the cumulative effect of the accounting change was not material 
net earnings in  we reported net earnings of million  or per diluted share compared to million  or per diluted share in earnings from continuing operations were million in compared to million in the growth in earnings was primarily due to the absence of prior period restructuring and asset impairment charges of million after tax  increased gross profit driven by higher sales  partially offset by higher selling  administrative and research expenses 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  by business segment coatings in  net sales from our coatings segment were  million  an increase of from net sales of  million in in  our coatings segment realized benefits primarily driven by the impact of higher demand  especially in the architectural and functional coatings business  the favorable impact of currencies and higher selling prices 
sales from architectural and functional coatings  which account for the majority of total coatings sales  increased over the prior year due primarily to strong demand and increased selling prices and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of currencies 
this increase in demand is attributable to the strong building and construction markets as well as steady growth from new products  such as our latest opaque polymers and semi gloss binders 
the increase in demand in asia pacific was across most markets 
powder coatings sales increased due to the favorable impact of currencies and a slight increase in selling prices offset by lower demand especially in the european region 
automotive coatings sales increased from the prior year  primarily driven by the favorable impact of currencies  share gains in the north american market  and good growth from new products that provide higher end finishes in new car markets  partially offset by lower selling prices 
earnings from continuing operations were million for  as compared to million in the increase over the prior year was due largely to million in lower after tax restructuring and asset impairment charges 
the remaining increase is attributable to higher demand  the favorable impact of currencies and higher selling prices that were substantially offset by higher raw material  energy and sales and administrative costs 
performance chemicals in  net sales from performance chemicals were  million  an increase of from prior year net sales of  million  primarily driven by higher demand across most businesses  the favorable impact of currencies and higher selling prices 
sales from plastic additives increased from the prior year mostly driven by higher demand in north america  due to strong recovery in the pvc industry and share gain  europe and asia  especially in china and india  due to the shift in acrylic based products and the impact of higher selling prices and favorable foreign currencies 
sales from consumer and industrial specialties increased over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher demand in north america for biocides used in wood preservation and personal care products  in addition to strong demand for detergent dispersants in asia pacific and north america as well as favorable foreign currency 
net sales from process chemicals increased  mostly due to higher demand across most segments and regions with particular strength in ion exchange resins for the industrial and potable water markets  as well as the power industry  as well as stronger currencies and higher selling prices 
performance chemicals reported earnings from continuing operations of million  compared to million in the prior year  as higher demand  increased selling prices  the favorable impact of currencies  and efficient operations more than offset higher raw material and energy costs  as well as the absence of restructuring and asset impairment charges of million after tax that occurred in the prior year 
monomers in  net sales from monomers were  million  an increase of from prior year net sales of  million 
net sales figures for monomers include sales to our downstream monomer consuming businesses  primarily architectural and functional coatings  adhesives and sealants and performance chemicals 
sales to external customers increased to million in from million in the prior year 
this increase can primarily be attributed to higher selling prices and higher demand  due to strong overall global economies  as well as the favorable impact of currencies

electronic materials in  net sales from electronic materials were  million  a increase from net sales of  million in sales increased in all businesses and regions  primarily driven by increased demand for higher technology products 
the favorable impact of currencies essentially offset normal selling price declines of older product lines 
sales of advanced technology products  such as deep ultra violet photo resists  anti reflective coatings and chemical mechanical planarization pads and slurries increased from the prior period 
sales from circuit board technologies increased over the prior year driven by growth in asia pacific 
sales from semiconductor technologies increased as compared to on recovery of market conditions 
sales from packaging and finishing technologies increased from the prior period as demand for electronic and industrial applications continue to grow in all regions 
in  electronic materials reported earnings from continuing operations of million as compared to million in  primarily led by growth  especially in the higher margin advanced technology product lines  combined with disciplined cost management 
adhesives and sealants in  net sales from adhesives and sealants were million  an increase of from net sales of million in  primarily driven by the impact of favorable foreign currencies  selling price improvements and higher demand 
north american demand was up in many markets  due to overall solid economic growth 
higher sales in asia pacific and latin america were driven primarily by packaging and pressure sensitive adhesives 
earnings from continuing operations were million in compared to million in the increase from the prior year is due to higher selling prices  higher demand  the favorable impact of currency and favorable operations  partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 
while the performance of this business has improved over the prior year  continued improvement plans may be needed to meet our expectations and could result in material restructuring and asset impairment charges 
if we are unable to achieve the expected margins for this business  it would adversely impact the discounted estimated future cash flows for this segment  which are used to test the recoverability of goodwill 
this could result in material goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges if the fair value falls below the book value of adhesives and sealants net assets 
salt in  net sales from salt were million  an increase of from prior year net sales of million 
our salt segment benefited from favorable currency and increased selling prices partially offset by slightly lower overall demand 
higher demand for non ice control products  especially for water conditioning and industrial markets  largely offset the decreased ice control sales as compared with the very strong prior year 
earnings from continuing operations were million for compared to million from the prior year reflecting increased energy and employee related costs  promotional expenses for new products and higher distribution costs as compared to the prior year 
corporate corporate reported after tax expenses of million in  representing a increase over prior year after tax expenses of million 
insurance recoveries were lower by million after tax 
the remaining increase was 
table of contents primarily due to higher unallocated shared service costs including consulting expenses for process re engineering activities and internal control documentation as part of our efforts to meet compliance rules under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as higher environmental spending 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net sales and operating margins in  our consolidated net sales were  million  an increase of or million  from net sales of  million 
this increase was primarily driven by the impact of favorable foreign currencies and improved selling prices  as presented below sales change for from currency selling price other volume total change our coatings  performance chemicals  salt and electronic materials segments performed well in  accounting for or million of the total increase in net sales over results 
the impact of favorable foreign currencies on the results of these segments accounted for of this increase 
other factors contributing to the improvement are reported as follows coatings the september acquisition of the ferro corporation s european powder coatings business and improved selling prices  performance chemicals the december acquisition of the kureha plastic additives business and improved selling prices  salt higher ice control volume resulting from the impact of the severe winter weather in  and electronic materials higher demand for advanced technology product lines in microelectronics and advanced packaging in electronic and industrial finishes 
net sales from adhesives and sealants and monomers accounted for the remaining increase of  or million  of the total increase in consolidated net sales and are more fully described in the segment section below 
gross profit for was  million  an increase of from  million in on higher sales 
gross profit margin decreased in to from in as the impact of significantly higher raw material and energy costs were only partially offset by selling price increases 
gains from insurance settlements were material in both and results 
we recorded income of million and million in and  respectively 
selling and administrative expenses in  selling and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million from million in during  we began to see the favorable impact from recent restructuring efforts with lower salary and administrative costs as compared to however  the addition of full year results from our acquisitions  along with the unfavorable impact of foreign currency  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar on european expenses  outweighed these cost reductions 

table of contents research and development expenses we spent million on research and development costs in  a decrease of million from spending of million 
the decrease was driven by the discontinuation of our gene regulation research program in late  which was donated to the university of pittsburgh in  the absence of one time costs in directly associated with previous restructuring initiatives  primarily the shutdown of our bristol technical center in september  and improved cost controls and the benefits earned from earlier restructuring efforts 
interest expense interest expense for was million  a reduction from million in  primarily due to lower us interest rates 
higher interest expense due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency on our non us denominated debt was offset by the effect of lower us interest rates 
in december  we retired million of our debt 
amortization of finite lived intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for was million  a decrease from million in the decrease is due to a lower asset base as compared to  resulting primarily from the december impairment of million and the june impairment of million of certain finite lived intangible assets associated with our circuit board technologies and powder coatings businesses  respectively 
share of affiliate earnings  net in  we recorded affiliate net earnings of million  remaining flat with provision for restructuring and asset impairments in  we recognized million of restructuring and asset impairment charges  an increase of million over expense of million

the initiatives included million pertaining to a european restructuring initiative which commenced in the second quarter  million associated with the elimination of positions primarily in our north american support services  such as logistics  human resources  procurement and information technology announced in the fourth quarter  and million associated with several smaller reduction in force efforts in all of our businesses throughout the year 
in most cases  separated employees were offered early termination benefits 
the charge is based on actual amounts paid to employees as well as amounts expected to be paid upon termination 
all of these initiatives were designed to address business and infrastructure inefficiencies  reduce redundant costs and reposition our workforce to capitalize on the enhancements made possible by the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
included in the net million charge  is million increase in expense  comprised of a million reversal of charges recorded in for current year initiatives and million of expense pertaining to initiatives 
changes in estimates are recorded as actual costs are compared to original estimates and reserves are adjusted as expenses are finalized 
the changes to prior year initiatives mostly include settlement losses on pension obligations as individual pension liabilities were settled from the pension plan 
we recognize pension settlement gains or losses at the time an employee s individual liability is settled within the pension plan 
asset impairments in  we recognized a net million of asset impairment charges 
of the total  million was recognized as asset impairment charges recorded to adjust the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value  which was calculated using cash flow analyses 
the largest impairment of approximately million of finite lived intangible assets related to the lamineer product line of the powder coatings business in the coatings segment 
the remaining charge consisted primarily of million of finite lived intangible assets and million of net fixed assets associated with our specialty magnesia product line in the performance chemicals segment  which was acquired 
table of contents from morton  and million of other building and equipment impairments 
gains on sales of previously impaired assets offset the total impairment charge by million 
severance and employee benefits in  we recognized a net million of severance and associated employee benefit expense  of which million pertained to initiatives launched in  affecting positions in total 
these initiatives include million primarily for the closure of two european plants and smaller restructuring initiatives undertaken in several of our businesses 
in addition  million was associated with a general reduction in force of over positions throughout various functions of our organization 
in most cases  separated employees were offered early termination benefits 
the charge was based on actual amounts paid to employees as well as amounts expected to be paid upon termination 
offsetting the charge was million of income resulting from pension settlement gains associated with individuals terminated from our pension plans and changes to estimates  both of which were in connection with our repositioning 
asset impairments in  million of asset impairments charges were recorded to reduce the carrying value of certain identified assets to their fair values  which were calculated using cash flow analyses 
the largest single asset write down was million  recorded to write down certain long lived intangible and fixed assets of the circuit board technologies business in the electronic materials segment 
the remaining million of non cash charges  recorded during  related largely to the closure of two european plants and other building and equipment impairments 
other income  net in  net other income increased to million from million in this increase was primarily driven by foreign exchange gains recognized on net monetary assets that increased in value with the strengthening of the euro and yen 
income taxes in  we recorded a provision for income tax expense of million 
the effective tax rate on earnings was 
the effective rate on earnings in was  relatively consistent with cumulative effect of accounting change the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  was a required change in accounting principle  and the cumulative effect of adopting this standard as of january  resulted in a non cash  after tax charge of million in the first quarter of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was a required change in accounting principle  and the cumulative effect of adopting this standard as of january  resulted in a non cash  after tax charge of million effective in the first quarter of net earnings loss in  we reported net earnings of million  or per diluted share compared to a net loss of million  or a loss per diluted share of 
net earnings in included a charge of million for asset retirement obligations  resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
the net loss of million in was driven by the adoption of sfas no 
 which resulted in a million charge for impairment losses 
as discussed above  each of those charges was reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
earnings from continuing operations were million in compared to million in the increase in is attributable to the impact of favorable foreign currency  control over discretionary spending and improved demand and selling prices partially offset by million after tax of additional restructuring and asset impairments charges over as well as increased raw material  energy and manufacturing costs

we continue to see sales growth in all regions  except latin america 
powder coatings sales increased over the prior year primarily due to a full year of sales from our september acquisition of ferro s european powder coatings business  organic growth in europe and favorable foreign currency 
sales from automotive coatings decreased from the prior period primarily reflecting lower demand from major domestic automobile manufacturers 
earnings from continuing operations decreased million from the decline from the prior period was driven primarily by million  after tax of restructuring and asset impairment charges primarily for the write down of certain finite lived intangible assets associated with the lamineer product line of powder coatings  as well as restructuring charges associated with profit improvement initiatives in several of the coatings businesses recorded in the impact of favorable foreign currency and improved selling prices only partially offset significantly increased raw material and energy costs in performance chemicals in  net sales from performance chemicals were  million  an increase of from prior year net sales of  million 
sales from plastic additives increased from the prior period primarily due to the results of our acquisition of the kureha plastic additives business  the impact of favorable foreign currency and selling price improvements 
sales from consumer and industrial specialties increased over the prior period due to favorable foreign currency and greater demand in asia pacific and latin america for polyacrylic acid dispersants and our sea nine biocide that is used in marine paint 
net sales from process chemicals formed by combining the inorganic and specialty solutions and ion exchange resins businesses remained flat over as gains from favorable foreign currency offset lower demand 
performance chemicals reported earnings from continuing operations of million  compared to million in the prior year primarily due to the impact of favorable foreign currency  volume and selling price improvements which offset the higher raw material and energy costs 
earnings in included a million  after tax charge primarily for the impairment of finite lived intangible assets associated with the specialty magnesia product line and restructuring charges associated with our european and other smaller profit improvement initiatives 
earnings in included million  after tax of restructuring and asset impairments 
monomers in  net sales from monomers were  million  an increase of from prior year net sales of million  including intercompany sales 
sales to our business segments were million and million in and  respectively 
the improved sales reflect the impact of pricing changes made to recover higher raw material and energy costs and the impact of favorable foreign currency

overall  demand was lower in  primarily in the north american and european regions 
although we experienced growth in our north american and european caulk market  other chemistries  including our structural and label adhesives failed to improve over the prior year 
our latin america and asia pacific regions reported sales growth in markets for packaging adhesives  tapes and bonding 
earnings from continuing operations were million in  compared to a loss of million in the earnings increase is primarily due to fewer costs in directly associated with restructuring activities and costs incurred to implement prior year initiatives and the impact of favorable foreign currency

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview maintaining a strong balance sheet is an important objective of ours 
debt decreased in proportion to total capital total debt total stockholders equity during  indicating that our balance sheet has strengthened 
as of december   our debt ratio was  down from as of december  over the next several years  we expect to pursue growth strategies and provide cash returns to our stockholders without increasing this ratio 
we intend to deploy our cash to generate stockholder value through higher dividends  debt retirement  strategic investments in our core technologies  and stock repurchases  as appropriate  specifically to continue to pay higher cash dividends to our stockholders 
we have years of continuous annual dividend growth 
during this year period  our dividend has grown at an average annual compound rate of 
to take advantage of market opportunities from time to time to utilize cash efficiently by retiring long term debt prior to maturity 
reinvest in core businesses through our capital expenditure program to drive profitable growth and enhance stockholder value 
we may also consider selected acquisitions or alliances in targeted areas 
repurchase our common stock 
in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock through  with the timing of the purchases depending on market conditions and other priorities for cash 
our primary source of liquidity was cash provided by operations and our principal uses of cash were capital expenditures and dividends 
these are summarized in the table below year ended december  in millions cash provided by operations capital expenditures dividends in addition we retired million of our debt in december cash provided by operations cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   which is less than the million  generated in the decrease is due primarily to the increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sales  as well as increased payments for accounts payable and income taxes 
capital expenditures we intend to manage our capital expenditures to take advantage of growth and productivity improvement opportunities as well as to fund on going environmental protection and plant infrastructure requirements 
we have a well defined review procedure for the authorization of capital projects 
capital expenditures are below expenditures due primarily to completion of our multi year enterprise resource planning erp system implementation 
in may  we completed the final phase of the implementation of our erp system that has been our largest capital project in each of the last three years 
capital expenditures for this implementation were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  capital expenditures were approximately million as compared to the capital expenditures of million 
in addition to the erp system  significant capital additions include

dividends total common stock dividends paid in were million or per share  compared to million or per share in common stock dividends have been paid each year since  and the payout has increased annually at a compound annual growth rate since other cash flow information during  we invested million in cash equivalents  considered restricted cash  through a trust designed to meet financial assurance requirements of us state and local environmental agencies with respect to plant operations 
we previously satisfied these requirements by purchasing bank letters of credit

included in cash provided by financing activities is million received in may in exchange for closing an interest rate swap contract and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
additional information regarding our hedging activities is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and debt as of december   we had million in cash  including restricted cash  and  million in debt compared with million and  million  respectively  at december  a summary of our cash and debt balances is provided below 
table of contents december  december  in millions short term obligations long term debt total debt cash and cash equivalents restricted cash total on february   we announced the retirement of million of our notes 
in december of  we retired million of our debt 
these retirements are consistent with our objectives to reduce debt and was enabled by our strong cash flow from operations 
we issued million in long term debt related to our foreign operations in while our primary source of short term liquidity will be cash flows from operations  this will be supplemented with commercial paper and bank borrowings to support periodic local working capital needs 
in october  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with a syndicated group of banks 
this facility is committed until october and is not contingent upon our credit rating 
this unused facility replaced the previous million credit facility  which was to expire in management believes that our financial resources will adequately meet our business requirements during the next twelve months  including planned expenditures  working capital requirements and the dividend program 
moody s and standard poors currently rate our senior unsecured long term debt a and bbb  respectively with stable outlooks  and our short term commercial paper  p and a  respectively 
in general  we believe single a ratings are consistent with the objectives of our long term financial policies 
pension plan funding our us erisa qualified pension plans represent approximately of our pension plan assets and do not require additional funding in however  the amount and the timing of funding will be dependent on changes in the level of interest rates and the actual rate of return earned on plan assets 
funding could be accelerated if interest rate levels used to value liabilities decline or if assets fail to earn the assumed rate of return of 
for our smaller international plans  we contributed approximately million to meet funding needs in provided there is no further decline of the global capital markets  we expect this annual level of funding to be sufficient to meet our non us plan needs over the next several years 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table provides contractual obligations and commitments for future payments in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total within year years years over years long term debt  including current portion interest on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations see notes pension and other employee benefit funding esop loan guarantees interest on esop loan guarantees total contractual cash obligations notes for our requirements contracts  we have assumed that our existing business segments will require materials and services generally consistent with prior years 
the amount of the obligation is based upon either projected requirements or historical spend 
evergreen contracts are contracts that renew automatically until specifically cancelled by either party 
we have assumed that our evergreen contracts will continue through forecasting qualified pension plan contributions requires the usage of certain assumptions such as interest rates used to calculate plan liabilities  demographic assumptions used to determine changes in participation and rates of return on assets  therefore  we feel it is appropriate to only forecast out years due to the uncertainties of the future assumptions 
the non qualified plan and other employee benefits reflect expected future benefit payments  which are forecasted out through see notes on february   we announced the retirement of million of our notes for cash 
we expect this will reduce our interest expense by approximately million a year though july  trading activities we do not have any trading activity that involves non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
unconsolidated entities all significant entities are consolidated 
any unconsolidated entities are de minimis in nature and there are no significant contractual requirements to fund losses of unconsolidated entities

environmental there is a risk of environmental impact in chemical manufacturing operations 
our environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to minimize the possibility of significant environmental impact 
the laws and regulations under which we operate require significant expenditures for capital improvements  the operation of environmental protection equipment  environmental compliance and remediation 
future developments and even more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
our major competitors are confronted by substantially similar environmental risks and regulations 
we are a party in various government enforcement and private actions associated with former waste disposal sites  many of which are on the us environmental protection agency s epa national priority list  and we have been named a potentially responsible party prp at approximately inactive waste sites where remediation costs have been or may be incurred under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and similar state statutes 
in some of these cases we may also be held responsible for alleged property damage 

table of contents we have provided for future costs at certain of these sites 
we are also involved in corrective actions at some of our manufacturing facilities 
we consider a broad range of information when we determine the amount necessary for remediation accruals  including available facts about the waste site  existing and proposed remediation technology and the range of costs of applying those technologies  prior experience  government proposals for this or similar sites  the liability of other parties  the ability of other prps to pay costs apportioned to them and current laws and regulations 
we assess the accruals quarterly and update as additional technical and legal information becomes available 
however  at certain sites  we are unable  due to a variety of factors  to assess and quantify the ultimate extent of our responsibility for study and remediation costs 
among the sites for which we have accrued liabilities are both non company owned superfund sites and company facilities 
our significant sites are described in more detail below 
wood ridge site in wood ridge  new jersey  our subsidiary morton international morton and velsicol chemical corporation velsicol have been held jointly and severally liable for the cost of remediation of environmental problems associated with a mercury processing plant site acquired by a morton predecessor 
as of the date we acquired morton  morton disclosed and accrued for certain ongoing studies related to the site 
additional data gathering has delayed completion of these studies 
in our allocation of the purchase price of morton  we accrued for additional study costs and additional remediation costs based on the ongoing studies 
our exposure at the site will depend in part on the results of attempts to obtain contributions from others believed to share responsibility 
in  velsicol stopped paying its share of expenses 
velsicol s indemnitor  fruit of the loom  inc  has been reorganized under chapter bankruptcy and was discharged of its responsibility for this site after a payment to us of approximately million 
in  the bankruptcy court approved a government settlement entered into with velsicol  fruit of the loom  and other parties  which created a fund to be used to respond to the velsicol liabilities at several sites  including wood ridge 
although morton has contractual rights against velsicol for payment of a share of remedial costs that are not affected by the government settlement  velsicol has initiated litigation to substitute the fund described above in all documents and agreements connected with the wood ridge site 
regardless of the outcome of the litigation  we believe velsicol s ability to pay is limited 
in addition  we paid  for the epa to develop a work plan for a separate study of contamination in berry s creek  which runs near the site  and of the surrounding wetlands 
preparation of this work plan is underway 
in  the epa requested information relating to sources of contamination in berry s creek  we understand this request was sent to over ninety potentially responsible parties 
today  there is much uncertainty as to what will be required to address berry s creek  but cleanup costs could be very high and our share of these costs could be material to the results of our operations  cash flows and consolidated financial position 
moss point during  the epa notified morton of possible irregularities in water discharge monitoring reports filed by its moss point  mississippi plant in early morton investigated and identified other environmental issues at the plant 
although at the date of acquisition morton had accrued for some remediation and legal costs  we revised these accruals as part of the allocation of the purchase price of morton based on our discussions with the authorities and on the information available as of june  in  we reached agreement with the epa  the department of justice and the state of mississippi  resolving these historical environmental issues 
the agreement received court approval in early the accruals established for this matter were sufficient to cover the costs of the settlement 
as a part of this agreement  of the former morton chemical facilities were subject to environmental audit by an independent consultant 
findings were provided to the government and discussions with the government on potential penalties are underway 
all operations at this facility have now been terminated 
environmental investigation and interim remedial measures are proceeding pursuant to the court approved agreement 
in december  a complaint was filed in mississippi on behalf of over plaintiffs against morton  rohm and haas  joseph magazzu  a former morton employee  and the mississippi department of environmental quality alleging personal injury and property damage caused by environmental contamination 
since then  similar complaints were filed in mississippi on behalf of an additional  plaintiffs 
these are individual plaintiffs since mississippi procedural rules do not permit class actions 
at this time  we see no basis for these claims  and we will vigorously defend these cases 

table of contents paterson we closed the former morton plant at paterson  new jersey in december  and are currently undertaking remediation of the site under new jersey s industrial site recovery act 
investigation of contamination of shallow soils and groundwater is nearly complete  with further investigation of deeper groundwater ongoing 
remediation systems for product and shallow groundwater recovery are in operation 
removal of most of the contaminated soil is complete and further soil remediation measures are under design 
we are in negotiations with the united states department of justice to resolve claims under the clean air act relating to a explosion at this location 
picillo we have agreed to participate in a binding arbitration to resolve contribution claims against us by a group of companies performing remediation of the picillo superfund site in rhode island 
groundwater treatment and monitoring major remediation for certain sites  such as kramer  whitmoyer  woodlands and goose farm has been completed 
we are continuing groundwater remediation and monitoring programs 
reserves for these costs have been established 
company manufacturing facilities we also have accruals for corrective action programs under governmental environmental laws at several of our manufacturing sites 
the more significant of these accruals  in addition to those presented above  have been recorded at the following sites bristol  pennsylvania  philadelphia  pennsylvania  houston  texas  louisville  kentucky  ringwood  illinois  apizaco  mexico  jacarei  brazil  jarrow  uk  lauterbourg  france and mozzanica  italy 
we are in discussions with the epa regarding possible enforcement arising out of an environmental inspection in at our houston facility 
remediation reserves and reasonably possible amounts our reserves for environmental remediation are recorded as current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based on our estimated timing of payments 
the amounts charged to earnings pre tax for environmental remediation and related charges are presented below 
in millions balance december  amounts charged to earnings spending december  amounts charged to earnings spending december  our reserves represent those costs that we believe to be probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  we have identified reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
further  we have identified other sites  including our larger manufacturing facilities  where additional future environmental remediation may be required  but these loss contingencies cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
these matters involve significant unresolved issues  including the number of parties found liable at each site and their ability to pay  the outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities  the alternative methods of remediation and the range of costs associated with those alternatives 
we believe that these matters  when ultimately resolved  which may be over an extended period of time  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows  but could have a material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given period 

table of contents we have actively pursued lawsuits over insurance coverage for certain environmental liabilities 
it is our practice to reflect environmental insurance recoveries in the results of operations for the quarter in which the litigation is resolved through settlement or other appropriate legal processes 
these resolutions typically resolve coverage for both past and future environmental spending and involve the buy back of the policies and have been appropriately included in cost of goods sold 
we settled with several of our insurance carriers and recorded earnings pre tax of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
climate change there is an increasing global focus on issues related to climate change and particularly on ways to limit and control the emission of greenhouse gases  which are believed to be associated with climate change 
discussions and some initiatives on these topics including the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change are already well along in europe and related legislation has been introduced  but not passed  in the us 
the european union has indicated its commitment to greenhouse gas emission reduction independent of any ratification of the kyoto protocol 
we are very much aware of the importance of these issues and the importance of addressing greenhouse gas emissions 
due to the nature of our business  we have emissions of co from combustion sources  but our emissions of other greenhouse gases no  hfcs  etc 
are minimal as compared to co emissions 
we have therefore focused on ways to increase energy efficiency and curb potential increases in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from growth in production in addition to lowering the energy usage of existing operations 
although the lack of specific legislation prevents any accurate estimates of the impact on us  any legislation that limits co emissions may create a potential restriction to business growth by limiting the quantity of traditional energy sources available to all consumers of energy  including rohm and haas 
the outcomes of restricted energy availability could include increased energy cost  additional capital investment to lower energy intensity and rationed usage with the need to purchase greenhouse gas emission credits 
we will continue to follow these climate change issues  work to minimize any negative impacts on our operations and seek technological breakthroughs in energy supply and efficiency 
other environmental matters capital spending for new environmental protection equipment was million in  million in  and million in spending for and is expected to approximate million each year 
capital expenditures in this category include projects whose primary purposes are pollution control and safety  as well as environmental aspects of projects in other categories that are intended primarily to improve operations or increase plant efficiency 
we expect future capital spending for environmental protection equipment to be consistent with prior year spending patterns 
capital spending does not include the cost of environmental remediation of waste disposal sites 
the cost of operating and maintaining environmental facilities was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and was charged against current year earnings 
other litigation in february  we were served with european commission decisions requiring submission to investigations in france and the united kingdom  a search permit in japan from the japanese fair trade commission  an order for the production of records and information in canada and two grand jury records subpoenas in the united states 
all of these actions relate to a global antitrust investigation of the plastic additives industry 
we subsequently received a request for additional information from the japanese fair trade commission 
the japanese fair trade commission brought proceedings against named japanese plastic additives producers but did not initiate action against rohm and haas 
we do not expect further action in the japanese investigation 
we are cooperating fully with all governmental authorities 
in addition  we are a party to eight private civil antitrust actions that have been consolidated in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania  including one that originally had been filed in state court in ohio 
these actions have been brought against rohm and haas and other producers of plastic additives products by direct purchasers of these products and seek civil damages as a result of alleged violations of the antitrust laws 
the 
table of contents named plaintiffs in each of these actions are seeking to sue on behalf of all similarly situated purchasers of plastic additives products 
federal law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal antitrust law may recover three times their actual damages plus attorneys fees 
ohio state antitrust law provides for double damage indemnity 
in may  another lawsuit was filed in state court in california seeking to recover damage on behalf of california s indirect purchasers of plastic additive products 
in january  an indirect purchaser case was filed in state court in tennessee seeking to recover damages on behalf of a class of indirect purchasers residing in tennessee and other states and the district of columbia  and another lawsuit was filed in state court in vermont  seeking damages on behalf of a class of vermont indirect purchasers 
also in january  a direct purchaser of plastics additives products filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of ohio alleging its own individual claims for damages 
in february  three additional indirect purchaser cases were filed in state courts in nebraska  ohio and arizona 
we do not believe any of these cases have merit and will vigorously defend against them 
there has been increased publicity about asbestos liabilities faced by manufacturing companies 
in the past  many companies with manufacturing facilities had asbestos on their premises 
as a result of the bankruptcy of asbestos producers  plaintiffs attorneys are increasing their focus on peripheral defendants  including our company  which had asbestos on its premises 
historically  these premises cases have been dismissed or settled for minimal amounts because of the minimal likelihood of exposure at our facilities 
as the asbestos producers are bankrupted  the demands against companies with older manufacturing facilities of any type in the united states  such as our company  are increasing 
we have reserved amounts for premises asbestos cases that we currently believe are probable and estimable  we cannot reasonably estimate what our asbestos costs will be if the current situation deteriorates and there is no tort reform 
there are also pending lawsuits filed against morton related to employee exposure to asbestos at a manufacturing facility in weeks island  louisiana with additional lawsuits expected 
we expect that most of these cases will be dismissed because they are barred under worker s compensation laws  however  cases involving asbestos caused malignancies may not be barred under louisiana law 
subsequent to the morton acquisition  we commissioned medical studies to estimate possible future claims and recorded accruals based on the results 
morton has also been sued in connection with asbestos related matters in the former friction division of the former thiokol corporation  which merged with morton in settlement amounts to date have been minimal and many cases have closed with no payment 
we estimate that all costs associated with future claims  including defense costs  will be well below our insurance limits 
we are also parties to litigation arising out of the ordinary conduct of our business 
recognizing the amounts reserved for such items and the uncertainty of the ultimate outcomes  it is our opinion that the resolution of all these pending lawsuits  investigations and claims will not have a material adverse effect  individually or in the aggregate  upon our results of operations  cash flows or our consolidated financial position 
indemnifications in connection with the divestiture of several of our operating businesses  we have agreed to retain  and or indemnify the purchaser against certain liabilities of the divested business  including liabilities relating to defective products sold by the business or environmental contamination arising or taxes accrued prior to the date of the sale 
our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible  minimum claim amount or cap 
as such  it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss 
no company assets are held as collateral for these indemnifications and no specific liabilities have been established for such guarantees 
acquisitions and divestitures we had no significant acquisitions or divestitures during effective january   we began consolidating the results of a variable interest entity in accordance with fin r  as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we made no significant acquisitions in  but completed one divestiture 
in march  we completed the sale of our dry film photoresist business to eternal chemical company 
as a result of this sale  we closed our north american and european dry film photoresist manufacturing operations 
eternal chemical company will manufacture its newly expanded dry film photoresist product line under the eternal company label 
as part of the divestiture  we have entered into an agreement to distribute the entire eternal dry film photoresist product line in north america and europe  as well as to our existing customers in asia 
we made no significant divestitures in in september  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of ferro corporation s european powder coatings business for approximately million 
this business produces materials used mostly by manufacturers of metal products to finish materials like window frames and automotive wheels 
in december  we acquired the global plastic additives business of our joint venture partner  kureha chemical  for approximately million 
included in the acquisition are the commercial operations throughout the asia pacific region and other areas along with the manufacturing facilities and laboratories in singapore  as well as technical service laboratories in beijing 
additionally  we gained full control of manufacturing sites in singapore and grangemouth  scotland  which were sites previously part of the joint venture 
the acquisition effectively terminates the joint venture we had with kureha chemical 
working capital in  we continued to focus on improving our working capital management 
as compared to  days sales outstanding improved by days and days cost of sales in ending inventory improved by days 
details about two major components of working capital at the end of and are summarized below dollars in millions inventories year end balance annual turnover x x days cost of sales in ending inventory customer receivables year end balance annual turnover x x days sales outstanding 
table of contents land  buildings and equipment  net investments in land  buildings and equipment  net is summarized below in millions year end balance annual turnover x x notes for customer receivables and land  buildings and equipment  annual turnover figures are calculated by dividing annual sales by the average customer receivables or average land  buildings and equipment balance

days sales outstanding were calculated by dividing ending customer receivables  net by daily sales for the fourth quarter of both years presented 
days cost of sales in ending inventory was calculated by dividing ending inventory by daily cost of sales for the fourth quarter of both years presented 
in the fourth quarter of  cost of sales included million from insurance settlements 
asset turnover equals sales divided by average year end assets 
asset turnover was x in both and  and x in information systems the upgrade and consolidation of our global erp systems infrastructure was completed in may areas of concentration for this system included finance  human resources  customer relationship management  production scheduling  procurement  maintenance  sales and distribution 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements variable interest entities in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin r requires that a variable interest be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we adopted the provisions of fin r as of january  we are the primary beneficiary of a joint venture deemed to be a variable interest entity 
each joint venture partner holds several equivalent variable interests  with the exception of a royalty agreement held exclusively between the joint venture and us 
in addition  the entire output of the joint venture is sold to us for resale to third party customers 
as the primary beneficiary  we have consolidated the joint venture s assets  liabilities  and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements 
as we previously accounted for this entity as an equity method investment the cumulative impact of consolidation was not material to our net income 
we did not consider this a variable interest entity at the initial adoption date  however based on our subsequent evaluation  we concluded this entity should be consolidated under fin r 
accordingly  we have revised the prior period classification of our quarterly results in note to our consolidated financial statements to properly reflect the consolidated results of this variable interest entity effective january  we hold a variable interest in another joint venture  which we accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the variable interest relates to a cost plus arrangement between the joint venture and each joint venture partner 
we have determined that rohm and haas is not the primary beneficiary and therefore have not consolidated the entity s assets  liabilities  and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements 
the entity provides manufacturing services to us and the other joint venture partner  and has been in existence since as of december   our investment in the joint venture totals approximately million  representing our maximum exposure to loss 
pensions and other postretirement benefits in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  to improve financial statement disclosure for defined benefit plans 
this statement requires additional disclosures about the assets including plan assets by category  obligations and cash flows of defined pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
it also requires reporting of various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis 
generally  the disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december   however  information about foreign plans is effective for fiscal years ending after june  we adopted the revised sfas no 
during the quarter ended march  medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in may  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  which provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the act for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide drug benefits 
the act provides the opportunity for a medicare eligible retiree to obtain a prescription drug benefit under medicare  or for sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law  a federal subsidy with tax free payments commencing in under fsp fas  the effect of the federal subsidy is accounted for as a deferred gain  which would reduce our future benefit expense 
the effect of the subsidy has reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million and will reduce our annual benefit expense by million 
our estimates assume that our plans with defined dollar caps would not be eligible for the subsidy 
stock based compensation we grant various types of stock based compensation to directors  executives and employees 
the majority of our stock based compensation is awarded in the form of restricted stock  restricted stock units and non qualified stock options 
effective january   we prospectively adopted the fair value method of recording stock based compensation as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as a result  in 
table of contents we began to expense the fair value of stock options that were awarded to employees after january  prior to  we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  no compensation expense was recognized for stock options awarded prior to the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which allowed us to adopt sfas no 
prospectively  provide that the pro forma net earnings and net earnings per share be presented as if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards granted to employees  not just awards granted after the date of adoption 
since we chose the prospective method of expensing stock options  the actual stock based compensation expense recorded in and was less than the amount calculated for this pro forma requirement 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement eliminates the prospective option we have applied under sfas no 
and requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june due to the fact that the majority of our options issued prior to january   the date we adopted sfas no 
 will have vested as of june  the revised computations will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
inventory costs in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
foreign earnings repatriation fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  provides guidance under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  the jobs act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate income earned abroad principally for earnings that have previously been deemed permanently reinvested by providing a dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
we have not previously deemed our foreign earnings as permanently reinvested and have fully provided for taxes on unremitted foreign earnings 
as a result  we do not expect that fsp will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
qualified production activities deduction fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  application of fasb statement no  accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of provides guidance on applying the deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities 
the deduction will be phased in from through the jobs act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales 
the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in fasb statement no 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return 
we do not expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti and the phase in of this new deduction to result in a material change in our effective tax rate for fiscal years and  based on current earnings levels 

table of contents cautionary statements any statements we make in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including this filing  or other communications including press releases and analyst meetings and calls that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
these statements include  without limitation  those relating to anticipated product plans  litigation and environmental matters  currency effects  profitability  and other commitments or goals 
forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following currencies and economic conditions approximately of our sales are derived from outside the united states  a significant portion of which are denominated in foreign currencies 
also  significant production facilities are located outside of the united states 
our financial results therefore can be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
we use certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects  but we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
accordingly  reported sales  net earnings  cash flows and fair values have been and in the future may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  because of the extensive nature of our foreign business activities  financial results could be adversely affected by changes in worldwide economic conditions  changes in trade policies or tariffs  changes in interest rates  and political unrest 
competition and demand our products are sold in a competitive  global economy 
competitors include many large multinational chemical firms based in europe  asia and the united states 
new competitive products or pricing policies of our competitors can materially affect demand for and pricing of our products 
in addition  financial results are subject to fluctuations in demand  the seasonal activity of certain of our businesses and weather conditions  particularly for the salt segment 
we also manufacture and sell our products to customers in industries and countries that are experiencing periods of rapid change  most notably countries in eastern europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
these factors can affect demand for our products and therefore may have a significant impact on financial results 
supply and capacity from time to time  certain raw materials we require become limited 
it is likely this will occur again in the future 
should such limitations arise  disruptions of our supply chain may lead to higher prices and or shortages 
also  we are subject to increases in raw material prices and  from time to time  experience significant capacity limitations in our manufacturing operations 
these limitations  disruptions in supply  price increases and capacity constraints could adversely affect financial results 
technology we have invested significant resources in intellectual properties such as patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
since we depend on these intellectual resources for our financial stability and future growth  we rely on the protection that these intellectual property rights provide 
the development and successful implementation of new  competing technologies in the market place could significantly impact future financial results 
joint ventures  acquisitions and alliances we have entered  and in the future may enter  into arrangements with other companies to expand product offerings and to enhance our own capabilities 
we may continue to make strategic acquisitions and divestitures 
the success of acquisitions of new technologies  companies and products  or arrangements with third parties  is not predictable and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in realizing our objectives  or that realization may not take longer than anticipated  or that there will not be unintended adverse consequences from these actions 

table of contents environmental litigation risks and uncertainties related to environmental matters are discussed previously in this section under the caption environmental 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices since we denominate our business transactions in a variety of foreign currencies  finance our operations through long and short term borrowings  and purchase raw materials at market prices 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
our operating and financing plans include actions to reduce this uncertainty including  but not limited to  the use of derivative instruments 
we have established policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments or any instruments of which the fair market values are not available from independent third parties 
we manage counter party risk by entering into derivative contracts only with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating and by limiting the amount of exposure to each financial institution 
the terms of certain derivative instruments contain a credit clause where each party has a right to settle at market if the other party is downgraded below investment grade 
as of december   the fair market value of all derivative contracts was million that is carried as an asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
all of these contracts were with investment grade financial institutions 
we enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations 
the analyses quantify the impact of potential changes in these rates and prices on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during the forecast period  most commonly within a one year period 
the range of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over the forecast period 
fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices 
foreign exchange rate risk short term exposures to changing foreign exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
known and anticipated exposures are covered by using foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts 
most significant foreign currency exposures are related to our operations in germany  france  italy  netherlands  the united kingdom  sweden  switzerland  brazil  mexico  canada  japan  taiwan  china and australia 
we estimate that an instantaneous appreciation or depreciation in all the currencies of these countries from their levels against the dollar as of december   with all other variables held constant  would increase or decrease by million the fair value of foreign currency hedging contracts held at december  this estimate is based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
our products are manufactured and sold in a number of locations around the world 
we generate revenues and incur costs in a variety of european  asian and latin american currencies 
additionally  we finance operations outside of the united states in local currencies 
our diverse base of local currency costs  financings  and foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts will partially counterbalance the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates on revenues  earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
nevertheless  when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities including short and long term debt by million  net of derivative contracts outstanding as of december  a basis point decrease in interest rates will increase the fair value by million 
however  such changes in fair values would not have a material impact on our earnings per share or cash flows as the majority of our debt obligations at december  consisted of fixed rate instruments 
a basis point movement is equivalent to approximately of the weighted average rate on our worldwide debt 
commodity price risk we purchase certain raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas  propylene  acetone  butanol and styrene under short and long term supply contracts 
the purchase prices are generally determined based on prevailing market conditions 
changing raw material and energy prices have historically had material impacts on our earnings and cash flows in the past  and will likely continue to have significant impacts on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
commodity derivative instruments are used to reduce portions of commodity price risks 
assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  the potential change in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts held at december  approximates million
