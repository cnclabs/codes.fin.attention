item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview interpharm holdings  inc  the company or interpharm  through its operating wholly owned subsidiary  interpharm  inc  interpharm  inc 
and collectively with interpharm  we or us is engaged in the business of developing  manufacturing and marketing generic prescription strength and over the counter pharmaceutical products 
we currently make sales both under our own label and to wholesalers  distributors  repackagers  and other manufacturers which sell our products under their labels 
we currently manufacture and market generic drug products  which represent various oral dosage strengths for unique products 
of these  we hold seven abbreviated new drug applications anda for fourteen of these products 
the remaining products are manufactured under an over the counter monogram or are drugs which do not otherwise require andas 
we also manufacture fourteen generic products which are various dosage strengths of four unique products for united research laboratories  inc and mutual pharmaceutical company  inc our focus in the past has been primarily on cost effective manufacturing of a limited number of products 
as part of our ongoing expansion plan  we are in the process of transforming the company into a full service generic products provider 
to that end  over the past year  we have focused primarily on improving the infrastructure throughout our organization 
first  we have added a number of key personnel  which includes the appointment of cameron reid as chief executive officer  jeffrey weiss as an executive vice president in charge of sales and marketing  kenneth cappel as senior vice president of intellectual property  a vice president of operations and a director of logistics 
these individuals have over years of combined experience in the pharmaceutical industry 
we also continued to hire qualified supervisors  managers and regulatory compliance personnel to improve efficiency of operations and ensure regulatory compliance 
we believe that the addition of such key personnel  as well as our continued commitment to improvements in our infrastructure through capital expenditure on new equipment and upgrading current manufacturing facility  will allow us to increase capacity at that facility  thereby allowing us to pursue new customers for our existing product line 
we have also focused a significant amount of our resources over the past year to accelerate our new product development 
our marketing strategy has undergone significant changes as a result of the implementation of our expansion plan 
our current marketing strategy focuses on obtaining a broader customer base and making more direct sales 
with a broader customer base  we believe that we will be able to have a stable sales and production cycle for our products  as well as an easily accessible market for our new products 
by making more direct sales  we believe that we can maximize value and profits by eliminating intermediaries as well as offer better customer service and improve and strengthen our customer relationships 
we have begun to realize the benefits of this marketing strategy through the two recent launches of our female hormone product  as well as sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim smt where  in each case  we will realize significantly higher gross margins than we have historically achieved 
in addition  with our launch of smt  we have been able to make sales to national accounts as well as expand our customer base 
this strategy has also provided us with benefits to our existing product line in that we have been able to sell both ibuprofen and naproxen to some of these new accounts 
during the fiscal year ended june   we spent approximately  on research and development 
during the six month period ended december   we spent approximately  on research and development 
as we begun to implement our business plan during the first six months of this calendar year  we spent approximately  on research and development 
we will continue to spend on research and development at an even more accelerated pace over the next two years 
we currently anticipate filing over andas over the next months 
in an effort to help accelerate our product development  we have entered into strategic development partnerships with third parties to supplement our internal research and development efforts 
in fact  our previously announced contracts with tris  not only accelerate our product development efforts in both liquids  softgels and drugs that exhibit certain special release characteristics  but they also allow our own research and development team to use the technology for those drugs for other products 
our new product pipeline pursuant to our expansion plan is focused in six areas female hormone products  scheduled narcotics  products requiring special release characteristics  liquid products  softgel products and products coming off patent 
we have chosen some of these product areas because we possess existing core competencies  and because management believes that competition in these areas should be limited due to barriers to entry that we have overcome 
for example  female hormone products require a dedicated and segregated facility with separate air handling and other equipment to avoid cross contamination 
we have already built such a facility  have the necessary equipment and are producing female hormone products under our agreement with centrix pharmaceuticals  inc scheduled narcotics require compliance with regulations governing their handling  storage  segregation  filing and record keeping which create a significant barrier to entry to the market for these products 
we are already in compliance with these regulations and therefore  our product development strategy includes expanding this line of products to a full line of scheduled narcotics 
we have also entered into two agreements with tris pharma  inc tris for the development of up to immediate release liquid generic products  eight solid oral dosage generic pharmaceutical products  and two softgel products 
liquid and softgel products require dedicated equipment in a segregated area 
we are in the process of building liquid and softgel areas in our facilities 
the eight solid oral dosage products contain special release characteristics which makes the formulation and further development of these products more difficult than most generic products 
we believe this creates a barrier to entry and limits competition for such products 
as part of our arrangement with tris  we will bring certain specialized technology in house  and may be able to use such technology for future product developments 
we have also contracted with other third parties to develop certain products that will be coming off patent in the next few years 
in order for us to maximize our market share and gross margins for these products  it will be necessary for us to be in a position to launch such products on the date of patent expiration and any applicable exclusivity periods 
we believe that between our internal developments and those that we have outsourced to third parties  we can be in a good position to launch most of these products on the critical dates 
we intend to move a majority of our research and development efforts to our new facility in yaphank  new york before the end of this calendar year 
this move will increase nearly five fold our physical facilities devoted to research and development in the united states 
in addition  we have begun the process to secure land in ahmedabad  india on which we plan to build a  square foot facility  which will be used primarily for research and development 
this facility is also expected to be used for the processing of bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients api in preparation for finished goods manufacturing in the united states 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in constructing this planned facility 
we believe that once our facility in india is operational  we will be able to capitalize on the availability of highly qualified scientific and other research and development personnel at significant cost savings  thereby supplementing our continuing research and development activities in the united states 
regulatory compliance  manufacturing of product for use in bio equivalency studies  and filing of andas will all continue to be done at our research and development facility in the united states 
we believe our planned india facility will reduce our reliance on third parties for the development of our product line  thereby reducing the risk that we will either not be able to develop certain products or that we will not be able to develop such products in a timely manner 
we will  however  continue to evaluate opportunities with outside companies on certain products such as those requiring specialized technologies 
in order to finance our expansion plan  we have been utilizing our million advised line of credit obtained from hsbc bank 
we will have to spend a significant amount of money on research and development to continue our expansion plan and have already begun to do so 
while we will continue to rely on this advised credit line  continuing with our expansion plan will be dependent on our ability to raise additional capital through either additional debt financing or through an equity investment  the availability of which cannot be assured 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds  we will have to either delay or scale back on our expansion plan 
however  we do not believe our existing business would be materially adversely affected by such delay or scaling back of our expansion plans 
fiscal year ended june  june  revenue decreased   gross profit decreased   operating loss income decreased   net loss income decreased   fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  for the twelve for the twelve months ended months ended june  june  sales  net   cost of sales   gross profit   gross profit percentage operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses   related party rent expense   research and development   total operating expenses   operating loss income   other income expenses gain on sale of marketable securities  interest expense   interest and other income  total other expenses income   loss income before income taxes   benefit from provision for income taxes   net loss income   net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million  or 
significant components aggregating to this decrease are i a decrease in sales of allopurinol and atenolol of million to million for the year ended june  compared to sales of million during the year ended june   ii partially offset by increases in sales of hydrocodone bitartrate with ibuprofen  and prednisone aggregating million  and iii revenue from the sale of naproxen decreased by approximately million on a year over year basis 
revenue for the products discussed in i and ii above are generated through a manufacturing and supply agreement with a significant customer 
as such we are unable to control the revenue for these products 
the fluctuations in revenue by product were not attributable to any changes in pricing which  for our entire product line  remained relatively stable 
during the fiscal year ended june   two key customers  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of total sales 
the same two customers accounted for approximately for the fiscal year ended june  as previously reported in july   we have already entered into an agreement with centrix pharmaceutical  inc centrix for the sale of our first female hormone product 
that agreement commenced upon the first shipment of the product to centrix in august  and has a ten year term but  under certain circumstances  may be terminated by centrix at any time after the first year of the agreement s term 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  centrix is required to purchase a minimum million of the product during the first year of the agreement s term 
there are also additional annual minimum purchase requirements after the first year of the agreement s term for so long as the agreement remains in effect 
in the event that the agreement is terminated at any time  or for any reason  we maintain the right to market the product alone or with a third party 
in september   we launched sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim smt single and double strength tablets  which are sold under the name bactrim r 
smt is a widely used antibiotic used to treat infections such as urinary tract infections  bronchitis  ear infections otitis  traveler s diarrhea  and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia 
we have already entered into a number of sales contracts for smt and shipments have commenced 
gross profit cost of sales gross profit for the fiscal year ended june  decreased approximately million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended june  in addition  our gross profit percentage decreased percentage points from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  cost of sales decreased approximately million  or to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june   primarily due to decreased production and sales 
however  it increased as a percentage of net sales primarily as a result of i higher labor costs resulting from increased staffing  labor rates and payroll taxes and ii increases in insurance  depreciation and factory supplies 
during the year ended june   prices for our raw materials remained relatively constant 
however  as a result of recent weather economic factors we anticipate that some of the raw materials and packaging components will likely increase in the near future 
research and development during the fiscal year ended june   particularly during the period january  through june  our research and development efforts increased significantly 
we expensed approximately million during the fiscal year ended june  during the first six months of fiscal we expensed million 
however during the six month period ended june  our research and development efforts expanded approximately seven fold to million or million for the full year ended june  research and development expenses were primarily for materials  wages and bioequivalence studies for new drugs currently in development 
we believe that research and development expenses will represent a substantially larger percentage of our net sales in the future as we seek to expand our product line 
as previously discussed in february we  entered into two agreements with tris for the development and licensing of up to twenty five immediate release liquid generic products and seven solid oral dosage generic pharmaceutical products 
in the event that tris delivers twenty five products under the liquids agreement  of which there can be no assurance  tris is to receive approximately million in development fees from us and  in addition  tris is to receive a royalty of between and of net profits resulting from the sales of each product 
we are entitled to offset the royalty payable to tris each year  at an agreed upon rate  to recoup the development fees paid to tris under the liquids agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the solids agreement  as amended  we and tris are to collaborate on the development  manufacture and marketing of eight solid oral dosage generic products and two soft gel products  some of which may require us to challenge the patents for the equivalent branded products 
the solids agreement  as amended provides for payments of an aggregate of million to tris 
the solids agreement  as amended  also provides for an equal sharing of net profits for all but one product that is successfully sold and marketed  after the deduction and reimbursement to us of all costs incurred by us in the development and marketing of the solid products  including the amounts paid to tris under the contract 
the other product provides for a profit split of for us and for tris 
as we develop our research and development capabilities  the tris agreements have allowed us to bring in house several specialized technologies which would otherwise not be available to us  and which can allow us to manufacture and sell more higher margin and profitable products 
during the year ended june   we recorded and paid million to tris 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the fiscal year end june  or of net sales  an increase of million or percentage points over the prior year total of million  and of net sales 
major components of our selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  included payroll taxes and benefits million  selling commissions million  freight expenses million  legal and accounting million  insurance expense million and professional fees of million 
significant factors contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses are i salaries  including payroll taxes and benefits increased million from the twelve months ended june  primarily due to additions during the year of a new chief executive officer  as well as two other senior level executives  ii utilities increased million  iii investor relations listing fees increased million and iv professional fees  rents and licenses aggregating million 
we believe that general and administrative costs will likely increase during the next fiscal year as a result of our second facility becoming operational 
further  it is anticipated that selling expenses  specifically commissions will increase as a result of the anticipated increases in net sales 
in december  the fasb finalized sfas no 
r share based payment which will require us to expense stock options based on grant date fair value in its financial statements beginning the first quarter of fiscal as such  in future periods we will be reporting the non cash compensation expense 
interest expense our interest expense increased approximately million primarily as a result of increased borrowings to fund the yaphank location renovations and well as purchase necessary new equipment 
it is likely that  as a result of additional borrowings and higher interest rates  we will incur increases in our interest expense 
operating income as a result of our increase in research and development efforts described above from which we believe we will see the benefits from in the future  along with an increase in selling and general and administrative costs and a modest decrease in net sales  we incurred an operating loss of million for the year ended june  compared to an operating income of million for the year ended june  income taxes for the year ended june  we recorded an income tax benefit of million a decrease in income taxes of million compared to the year ended june  income tax expense of million 
liquidity and capital resources we currently finance our operations and capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and bank loans 
as a result of our research and development efforts  we incurred a net loss for the fiscal year ended june  of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended june  was million  as compared to cash provided by operations of million for the year ended june  significant factors comprising the cash used in operating activities include increases in inventories  accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in inventories is primarily a result of a new product launches scheduled for early in fiscal as well as necessary increases to support our customers requirements 
offsetting the above uses of cash are increases in accounts and accrued expenses payable and depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively 
other items affecting our net cash used in operating activities aggregated million 
bank lines of credit on march   we obtained a new million credit facility from hsbc 
the new credit facility consists of i a million mortgage loan for the purchase of our second manufacturing plant in yaphank  new york note  ii million of credit lines primarily to acquire new equipment and for renovations  and iii a million general line of credit 
details of the new facility are as follows o the  mortgage loan is to be repaid with monthly principal installments of  commencing on august  with the balance due june  o two advised secured credit lines aggregating  primarily for acquisitions of equipment and for renovations of our plant 
the balance of the funds accessed through these credit lines will convert into fully amortizing month term loans 
o a  advised non revolving secured facility for equipment purchases 
each advance cannot exceed of the invoice amount of the new equipment and is convertible into fully amortizing month term loans 
o the  advised secured line of credit is primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes 
this new credit facility is collateralized by substantially all assets of the company 
at our option interest will be calculated at i libor plus per annum pa for to month periods  or at ii the bank s then fixed prime rate 
as of june   the interest rates on the working capital lines range from pa to pa and interest on the mortgage loan was pa 
on july   the mortgage loan interest rate increased to pa and will be recalculated at december  the bank will review the new credit facility annually  the next review is scheduled to occur no later than november  the credit lines are terminable by the bank at any time as to undrawn amounts 
in addition  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants  and as of june   we were in default of three financial covenants 
we have obtained a waiver from the bank 
in addition to the outstanding borrowings at june   we had approximately million outstanding under advised letters of credit 
as a result  at june   we had approximately million available for future borrowings 
during fiscal  the company and hsbc informally agreed to consolidate the four credit lines into one advised credit line totaling million 
as a result  the million of advances have not been allocated to each individual credit line 
because the company and the bank have not determined the amount of loans that are available to be converted into month term loans  the entire advised credit facility is classified as current 
as previously disclosed  we entered into agreements with tris for the development and delivery of over thirty new technical packages 
the combined costs of these two agreements will approximate million of which we have paid million as of june  the balance on one agreement of million could be paid within three years 
the second agreement has a balance of million and is scheduled to be paid within two years 
future cash flows could be aided by utilization of our available federal net operating loss carryforwards nols 
at june  the company has remaining federal nols of approximately  and state nols of approximately  expiring through pursuant to section of the internal revenue code regarding substantial changes in company ownership  utilization of these nols is limited 
approximately  of these nol s are available in fiscal  and utilization of  of these nol s is limited and becomes available after fiscal the limitations lapse at the rate of  per year  through fiscal in order to finance our expansion plan  we have been utilizing our million advised line of credit obtained from hsbc bank 
we will have to spend a significant amount of money on research and development to continue our expansion plan and have already begun to do so 
while we will continue to rely on this advised credit line  continuing with our expansion plan will be dependent on our ability to raise additional capital through either additional debt financing or through an equity investment  the availability of which cannot be assured 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds  we will have to either delay or scale back on our expansion plan 
however  we do not believe our existing business would be materially adversely affected by such delay or scaling back of our expansion plans 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable at june  was million as compared to million at june  the average annual turnover ratio of accounts receivable to net sales for the fiscal years ended june  and was and turns  respectively 
as our turns are calculated on an annual average  the decrease is primarily the result of credit terms for new larger customers as well as when sales are recognized during the periods 
our accounts receivable continue to have minimal risk with respect to bad debts  however this trend cannot be assured 
inventory at june   our inventory was million as compared to million at june  we believe the increase in inventory is necessary in order to maintain our future planned growth and overall customer demands

cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at june  were million as compared to  at december   an increase of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the proceeds from the sale of atec computer operations  interpharm  inc s cash flow from operating activities and net bank borrowings of approximately million 
offsetting these events were equipment purchases of  during the six month period ending june  from time to time in the past  interpharm  inc s shareholders  directors  and officers had made loans to it for working capital

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that interpharm make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  interpharm evaluates judgments and estimates made  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  income taxes and contingencies including litigation 
interpharm bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing its financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue from the sale of interpharm products are recognized upon shipment of the product 
upon a review of specific accounts and historical experience we record  when necessary  a provision for allowances  chargebacks  returns and other sales credits based 
these provisions have been recorded as a reduction of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
we purchase raw materials from two suppliers  which are manufactured into finished goods and sold back to such suppliers as well as to other customers 
we can  and do  purchase raw materials from other suppliers 
we also i have the general inventory risk of loss associated with the raw materials purchased  ii negotiate the selling price for the finished product  iii significantly change the raw material into a finished product based upon our specifications  and iv have the option to obtain the raw materials from alternate sources 
these factors among others  qualify us as the principal under the indicators set forth in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal vs 
net as an agent 
if the terms and substance of the arrangement change  such that we no longer qualify to report these transactions on a gross reporting basis  our net income and cash flows would not be affected 
however  our sales and cost of sales would both be reduced by a similar amount 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon customer specific analysis and assessment of past due balances 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is an increase in past due balances or for customer specific circumstances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at june  and  at june  inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials and manufacturing 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when factors such as expiration dates and spoilage indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are disposed of and completely written off in the period incurred 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse 
the net deferred tax asset is adjusted by a valuation allowance  if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our net deferred tax asset at june  was million and million at june  recent new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no

 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share

issue and uncertainties risk of product liability claims the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products subject us to the risk of product liability claims 
we believe that we maintain an adequate amount of product liability insurance  but no assurance can be given that such insurance will cover all existing and future claims or that we will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates

at june   the interest rates on the borrowings ranged from pa to pa and the interest rate on the mortgage note payable was pa 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  fluctuations in commodity prices or other market risks  nor do we invest in speculative financial instruments 
if principal amounts outstanding under our credit facilities remained at the year end level for an entire year and our effective interest rate increased or decreased by  we would pay or save  respectively  approximately million in interest that year
