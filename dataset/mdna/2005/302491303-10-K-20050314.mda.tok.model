item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a diversified  global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets 
we operate in three business segments agricultural products  specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals 
agricultural products principal focus is on insecticides  which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests  and on herbicides  which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth 
specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture  structure and physical stability  pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage 
our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials  including soda ash  peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 
highlights was a year during which we experienced sales growth in all of our business segments 
we also had significant growth in income from continuing operations before income tax 
additionally  we reduced our debt levels and refinanced our credit agreement 
consolidated revenue of  million was up percent from the prior year 
agricultural products  specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals had revenue increases of  and  respectively 
sales across all segments benefited from higher volumes and favorable foreign currency translation 
additionally  in agricultural products  an improved farm economy  especially in brazil contributed to sales growth 
income from continuing operations before income tax of million was up significantly from the prior year 
this was driven by a and increase in operating profit in agricultural products and industrial chemicals  respectively  and lower interest expense levels 
interest expense of million for the year ended december  decreased from the prior year 
net income was million compared to million in net income in included an after tax benefit of million due to tax adjustments offset by restructuring and other charges gains  astaris restructuring expenses  write off of deferred financing fees and charges to discontinued operations 
outlook in we expect continued growth in our earnings 
we expect a significant recovery in our industrial chemicals segment to be the primary driver of that growth as well as reduced interest expense due to lower debt levels and reduced rates following our refinancing 
we expect that the improvement in industrial chemicals will be primarily driven by higher soda ash selling prices due to the tight supply conditions in the market 
lower debt levels and reduced interest rates are expected to lower our interest expense in as well as provide greater financial flexibility and liquidity 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have described our accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we have reviewed these accounting policies  identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical 
these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current conditions and other reasonable factors 

table of contents environmental we provide for environmental related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated 
where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability  that estimate has been used 
where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other  the lower end of the range has been used 
estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the epa  or similar government agencies  are generally accrued no later than when a rod  or equivalent  is issued  or upon completion of a ri fs that is accepted by us and the appropriate government agency or agencies 
estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management  as well as by financial and legal management and  if necessary  adjusted as additional information becomes available 
the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination  required remediation methods  and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 
our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances 
such costs principally include  among other items  ri fs  site remediation  costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan  fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort  and future monitoring costs 
estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies  specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 
provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income  net of probable and estimable recoveries from named prps or other third parties 
such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 
in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves  we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible 
we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated  as well as the status of our claims against such parties 
although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty  the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site by site basis 
our liability includes management s best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties 
we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects 
we have recorded recoveries representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies  us government agencies and other third parties  of million and million  respectively  at december  and these recoveries are recorded as an offset to environmental liabilities  continuing and discontinued 
cash recoveries for the years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  at december  we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as million 
we recorded total environmental provisions related to both operating and discontinued sites of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
impairments and valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and long term investments  goodwill and intangible assets 
we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash 
table of contents flows are less than net book value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets  which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable 
the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices  volumes  costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 
we prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates  discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period 
we performed this test in and determined that no impairment charge was required 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees 
the costs or benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions  including interest discount rates  healthcare cost trend rates  expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees 
the costs or benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions  such as average retirement age  mortality  employee turnover  and plan participation 
to the extent our plans actual experience  as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics  differs from these assumptions  the costs and obligations for providing these benefits  as well as the plans funding requirements  could increase or decrease 
when actual results differ from our assumptions  the difference is typically recognized over future periods 
in addition  the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs in future periods 
we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five year period 
we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements 
the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range  high or low  of the actual market value of assets  and is adjusted accordingly 
we recorded million  million and million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in  and  respectively 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of million and million at december  and  respectively  which were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income section in stockholders equity 
we made voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of million and million  respectively  for and in addition  we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of million and million  for and  respectively 
we paid other postretirement benefits  net of participant contributions  of million and million for and  respectively 
our estimated cash contributions for include approximately million in nonqualified pension benefits  approximately million in other postretirement benefits  and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of approximately million 
we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high quality corporate bonds  including moody s investors service  inc moody s aa rated corporate and industrial bond indices 
in selecting the discount rate for  we placed particular emphasis on a portfolio of high quality aa graded bond investments constructed by our actuary to be used for this purpose 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan  we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries  including historical market returns  information on long term real return expectations by asset class  inflation assumptions  and expectations for 
table of contents standard deviation related to these best estimates 
we also consider the historical performance of our own plan s trust  which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately percent over the last years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors 
the current asset allocation for our plan is approximately percent equities us and us  percent fixed income and percent cash and other short term investments 
given an actively managed investment portfolio  the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio  using geometric averaging  and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately three percent  is between nine percent and eleven percent for both us and us equities  and between five percent and seven percent for fixed income investments  which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption 
we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions 
for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in this assumption see our discussion below 
the other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic other postretirement benefit costs noted above do not reflect the effects of the medicare  prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare act 
in september  we elected not to recognize any of the potential accounting effects of the medicare act because the actuarial equivalence of our retiree medical plan was undeterminable as of september  we required more information on how actuarial equivalence would be calculated that was not available in existing versions of the regulations in order to determine if our retiree medical plan met the threshold 
on january   the centers for medicare medicaid services cms released the final regulations on the medicare prescription drug benefit 
the final regulations provide comprehensive guidance on how the actuarial equivalence of retiree medical plans will be determined 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the final regulations to determine the estimated effects  if any  of the medicare act on our retiree medical plan and the other postretirement benefit liabilities and net annual other postretirement benefit costs reported in our consolidated financial statements 
sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 
a one half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by million at december  and million at december   and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by million at december  and million at december   and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent increase in the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
a one half percent decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs are found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for this allowance  we have considered a number of factors including future income  the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies 
in the event that we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
at december  and  the valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 

table of contents results of operations  and overview year ended december  per share diluted per share diluted per share diluted in millions  except per share data consolidated revenue net income loss net income included the following after tax charges restructuring and other charges gains astaris restructuring write off of deferred financing fees discontinued operations tax adjustments after tax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges our share of charges recorded by astaris the phosphorous joint venture is included in equity in earnings loss of affiliates 
we believe that the non gaap financial measure after tax income from continuing operations  excluding restructuring and other income and charges  and its presentation on a per share basis  provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts 
we also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period 
this measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income loss or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 
the explanation of the reconciling items between net income and after tax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges can be found in the results of operations discussions below for compared to and for compared to see segment results for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for  and results of operations compared to in the following discussion  year refers to the year ending december  and prior year refers to the year ending december  all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 
revenue for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of percent compared to the  million recorded in the prior year period 
this increase was driven by higher sales in all our segments  which are discussed separately below 
restructuring and other charges gains totaled a loss of million million after tax in compared to a gain of million million after tax in the before tax loss of million that we recorded in was primarily a result of severance costs that are expected to result in improved cost efficiencies 
agricultural products and specialty chemicals recorded million and million  respectively  of these severance costs 
severance costs in related to approximately people most of whom separated from us in we also recorded million of charges related to continuing environmental sites 
these charges were partially offset by non cash gains totaling million in industrial chemicals and million in corporate 

table of contents the before tax gain of million in was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of an office building in foret  our spanish subsidiary  offset by charges related to severance costs  asset abandonments and environmental costs 
the detail of these charges by segment are explained further in our results of operations analysis compared to equity in loss earnings of affiliates 
equity in loss of affiliates was million versus million in the prior year 
in  astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance 
the restructuring  which included the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate stpp market  reduced fixed costs through facility and selective product rationalizations and resulted in improvement in the venture s position in food and technical phosphates 
the restructuring was completed in and included four facility closures and the consolidation of operations into the remaining three astaris sites 
our portion of astaris and restructuring charges  which totaled million million  after tax and million million  after tax  respectively  were recorded in equity in loss earnings of affiliates 
astaris earnings improved during compared to the prior year due to the benefits of this restructuring 
interest expense  net decreased to million compared to million in the decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs from the december and june term loan repricings  lower debt levels in compared to the prior year and the effect of our debt refinancing in october see our discussion on liquidity and capital resources for further details on the refinancing 
write off of deferred financing fees in represents the unamortized fees from our financing that were written off when we refinanced our debt in october provision benefit for income taxes was a benefit of million in compared with a benefit of million for reflecting effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the change from to was due to tax adjustments recorded in  the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us  dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments 
was affected by a tax benefit of million resulting from an adjustment to income tax liabilities due to a december pronouncement from the internal revenue service  a tax benefit of million primarily related to valuation allowance adjustments and a tax benefit of million resulting from a refund received from the internal revenue service 
the tax rate in was affected by a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us income we earn outside of the us is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned domestically 
in addition  dividends received from our foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments further affected the benefit for income taxes in discontinued operations 
we recorded after tax charges of million in versus million in charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance and legal reserves offset by gains related to tax adjustments for previously discontinued operations 
our environmental charges included amounts totaling million after tax to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in new jersey and at our middleport  new york site 
charges are primarily for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 
net income increased to million in compared with million in reflecting higher earnings from our agricultural products and industrial chemicals segments and decreased interest expense somewhat offset by lower earnings in our specialty chemicals segment 
in addition  net income for included restructuring and other charges  charges related to the astaris restructuring  write off of deferred financing fees  charges in our discontinued operations and tax adjustments  the sum of which totaled a benefit of million after tax or per share on a diluted basis 
prior year net income included after tax restructuring and other charges gains  astaris restructuring and charges in our discontinued operations  the sum of which totaled a charge of million after tax or per share on a diluted basis 

table of contents reclassifications and adjustments our results for the year ended december   were unfavorably affected by million million after tax or per diluted share related to the elimination of inter company profit in our inventory and the elimination of the recognition of revenue due to sales cutoff 
our results for the year ended december  were favorably affected by a million or per diluted share benefit recorded to income taxes related to adjustments to deferred tax liabilities and income tax valuation allowance related to prior periods 
additionally  our results for the year ended december  were favorably affected by a million after tax or per diluted share benefit recorded to discontinued operations due to adjustments to deferred tax liabilities related to previously discontinued operations 
further  our stockholders equity was favorably affected by million due to adjustments to deferred tax liabilities related to technologies 
we recorded this adjustment through retained earnings  consistent with the accounting for the spin off of technologies 
the adjustments to our income taxes  discontinued operations and retained earnings were recorded as a result of a review of our deferred taxes and income tax valuation allowance in which balances were adjusted related to discontinued operations and to prior periods 
we believe that the effect of the above eliminations and adjustments are not material to our financial position or results of operations or liquidity for any prior period 
other financial data corporate expenses increased percent to million in from million in the prior year due entirely to higher spending related to sarbanes oxley section compliance 
other income and expense  net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments  pension expense and realized foreign currency gains and losses 
other income  net  increased to million from million in the prior year due to the impact of the lifo adjustment and other non operating items  partially offset by an adjustment in pension expense 
segment results compared to information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
agricultural products year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit higher insecticide sales accounted for over half of the revenue increase and were driven by strong performance in latin america  particularly brazil  due to an improved farm economy and heavy pest pressures  and to a lesser extent improved performance in europe 
increased herbicide sales resulted from growth in brazil  new labels in europe  strong early season demand in north america and slightly improved conditions in asia 
favorable foreign currency effects  primarily from the stronger euro and payments from third party producers also contributed to revenue growth 
the increase in segment operating profit was due to higher sales  lower production costs and improved product mix resulting from our focus on higher value proprietary products 

table of contents in  we believe that agricultural products sales will be flat as growth in new products and labels coupled with continued strong performance in brazil and europe offsets the impact of lower selling prices resulting from generic competition in north america 
earnings are also expected to be flat as lower manufacturing costs from sourcing initiatives are offset by higher energy  raw materials and freight costs 
specialty chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit the biopolymer business drove most of the revenue increase with higher sales in the pharmaceutical and food ingredients markets as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  primarily the euro 
revenue in the lithium business increased slightly from the prior period as the benefits of increased sales into the battery market and favorable foreign currency translation were partially offset by lower sales into the pharmaceutical market 
segment operating profit was down percent versus the prior period due to the impact of higher raw material costs and spending on biopolymer growth initiatives partially offset by favorable foreign currency 
in  we expect mid single digit revenue growth driven by strong organic growth in both the biopolymer and lithium businesses 
full year earnings are expected to exceed the rate of sales growth  driven by productivity improvements 
industrial chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit the industrial chemicals revenue increase was driven by improved foret sales  our european industrial chemicals business  which resulted from favorable foreign currency translation and higher selling prices in phosphates and peroxygens 
higher alkali sales were driven by strong volume growth in export markets and improved domestic soda ash selling prices partially offset by lower net soda ash export prices in asia and latin america 
lower domestic peroxygen sales resulted from an unfavorable product mix and lower persulfate prices  partially offset by improved volumes 
the increase in segment operating profit was due to higher sales  and improved earnings at astaris 
these benefits were slightly offset by higher energy prices  primarily natural gas and higher freight costs 
astaris earnings improved significantly as a result of its restructuring 
we expect mid single digit growth in revenue in driven by higher selling prices  particularly in soda ash 
we expect full year earnings growth of approximately percent  which will be driven by higher selling prices  particularly in soda ash  partially offset by higher energy  raw material and transportation costs 
this outlook includes the impact of restarting  short tons of mothballed soda ash capacity 
in connection with this restart we expect modest startup expenses of approximately million and capital expenditures of approximately million 

table of contents results of operations compared to revenue for the year ended december  was  million up percent compared with  million in this increase was due to a stronger euro  growth in specialty chemicals sales in the pharmaceutical market and increased agricultural products sales in latin america and europe 
restructuring and other charges gains totaled million million after tax in compared with million million after tax in the before tax gain of million we recorded in was the result of a gain on the sale of an office building in foret  our spanish subsidiary  offset by charges in all segments 
the gain on the building was million  net of related costs  including severance 
severance costs were recorded in industrial chemicals and in both our agricultural products and specialty chemicals segments 
total severance charges  including amounts recorded at foret  were million and related to approximately people most of whom separated from fmc in late the remaining charges in the year included non cash charges totaling million primarily for the abandonment of an asset in the specialty chemicals segment  offset by the reversal of certain workforce related and facility shutdown reserves in corporate as shown in the table in note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k resulting from our ability to meet certain obligations on more favorable terms than expected when the reserves were established 
the remaining other charges of million in were related to environmental costs at operating sites  largely in our industrial chemicals segment 
in  restructuring and other charges of million  before tax  consisted of charges related to each of our segments 
the details  by segment  are discussed below 
in an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our industrial chemicals business we undertook several cost saving initiatives that resulted in million of restructuring charges 
included in this amount was a million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in spring hill  west virginia 
we also mothballed our granger facility  in green river  wyoming resulting in a million restructuring charge 
the majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and severance  all of which occurred in in addition we recorded a million restructuring charge for costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our us phosphorus chemicals business  alkali  peroxygens and at foret 
there were severances related to these restructurings  all of which occurred in in agricultural products  we incurred million of restructuring charges in  of which million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy as we shifted our focus from soybeans to higher value crops 
a million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in europe  which allows us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our european markets 
of the severances related to these restructurings occurred in we recorded million of restructuring charges in our specialty chemicals segment in in an effort to realign product divisions within biopolymer  both domestically and internationally 
the majority of these costs resulted from the severance of people  which occurred in the first half of reorganization costs of million and other charges of million were also recorded in these charges are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
also  of the million of restructuring charges recorded in  million was spent in equity in earnings loss of affiliates was a loss of million in versus earnings of million in the loss in included charges totaling million related to the restructuring program at astaris 
weaker affiliate earnings were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract  which had a prior year pre tax benefit of approximately million and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure 

table of contents interest expense  net increased by percent to million in compared to million in reflecting higher interest costs in from our refinancing in the fourth quarter of provision benefit for income taxes was a benefit of million in compared with a provision of million for reflecting tax rates of and  respectively 
the tax rate in was affected by a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us income we earn outside of the us is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned domestically 
in addition  dividends received from our foreign operations and a change in the valuation allowance  further contributed to the change in the provision benefit for income taxes from to in  the tax rate resulted primarily from the effect of depletion and differing foreign tax rates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k for further details 
discontinued operations 
we recorded after tax charges of million and million in and  respectively  for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 
see discontinued operations note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further details 
net income decreased to million in compared with million in reflecting increased interest expense  net  and lower earnings from our industrial chemicals segment somewhat offset by higher earnings in our other segments 
in addition  net income for included restructuring and other charges gains  astaris restructuring and charges in our discontinued operations totaling million after tax or per share on a diluted basis 
as noted in the table under overview above  these charges related primarily to restructuring programs  particularly at our astaris affiliate  reported in equity in earnings loss of affiliates  but also included a gain on the sale of an office building and an after tax environmental charge to discontinued operations of million 
prior year net income included after tax restructuring and other charges of million also related to primarily in industrial chemicals  and an after tax environmental charge to discontinued operations of million 
other financial data the following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
corporate expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to higher insurance costs 
other income and expense  net is comprised primarily of realized foreign currency gains and losses  lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense 
net other income was million higher in than the loss of million 
this variance is largely attributable to a lifo adjustment and the impact of foreign currency 
segment results compared to agricultural products year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit 
table of contents the increase in sales was driven by growth in all regions  except north america  and was largely achieved in the fourth quarter of latin america and europe showed the most significant growth at the end of sales in latin america  particularly brazil  were driven by improved market conditions  and higher sales of proprietary herbicides and insecticides used on such crops as cotton and sugar cane 
stronger european sales resulted from a number of factors  including a stronger euro  new approved uses for propriety herbicides referred to as new labels  and our overall efforts to focus on higher value  proprietary products 
these increases more than offset the decrease in north american insecticide sales into the crop protection market due to lower than average pest pressures 
our professional pest control and home and garden business also saw continued growth during because of this regional sales mix  insecticides were essentially flat for the year  while higher sales of herbicides resulted in most of the revenue increase in versus for  our agricultural products revenues were made up of percent insecticides  percent herbicides and percent fungicides 
the segment operating profit improvement in compared to was a result of higher sales  improved product mix related to our focus on higher value proprietary products and lower production costs  some of which was related to our outsourcing strategy in some product lines 
specialty chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit biopolymer  which generated percent of segment revenues  had sales increases of percent compared to while sales in our lithium business  which represents percent of the segment  increased by more than percent compared with segment sales increases in were driven by us and european growth in biopolymer s mcc products in the pharmaceuticals market  where mcc is used as a binder and disintegrant in tablets 
these increases were partially offset by lower biopolymer sales in our food business  largely as a result of lower demand in the nutritional beverage market 
also contributing were strong lithium sales in the pharmaceutical synthesis market and in the energy storage market from military demand for rechargeable batteries 
in addition  the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  primarily the euro  further contributed to the increase in revenue in segment operating profit increased in compared to due to higher sales  favorable foreign currency translation  improved productivity and sales mix 
industrial chemicals year ended december  increase decrease in millions revenue operating profit industrial chemicals sales increased in due almost entirely to foret  our european industrial chemicals business  where favorable currency translation and higher peroxygen selling prices resulted in a percent increase in sales compared with european prices for peroxygens were driven by higher capacity utilization levels coupled with strong demand 
the increased sales at foret were partially offset by decreased 
table of contents revenues in our largely north american based alkali and peroxygens hydrogen peroxides and active oxidants businesses  where sales in decreased percent and percent  respectively  compared with the prior year 
the decrease in alkali was largely a result of lower export prices for soda ash  alkali s primary product  due in part to recent capacity additions in china 
despite successful implementation of some selling price increases in  peroxygen sales decreased due to weaker north american hydrogen peroxide volumes to the pulp market 
for  our industrial chemicals segment revenue is made up of percent alkali  percent foret and percent peroxygens 
lower segment operating profit in was largely the result of significantly lower affiliate earnings from astaris and lower sales in our alkali and domestic peroxygen businesses 
weaker affiliate earnings from astaris were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract in  which had a pre tax benefit of approximately million  and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure 
in  astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance 
the restructuring  included the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate stpp market 
our portion of astaris restructuring charges  which totaled million  before tax  were recorded in equity in earnings loss of affiliates 
recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements and regulatory items see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k liquidity and capital resources on october   we executed an amended and restated million senior secured credit agreement the credit agreement  which provides for a million revolving credit facility million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit  a million term loan  and a million stand alone letter of credit facility collectively  the credit facilities 
the net proceeds from the initial borrowings under the credit facilities  available cash and certain restricted cash released concurrently with the execution of the credit agreement were used to repay all borrowings under and terminate the former million term loan  and to pay fees and expenses of approximately million 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for a summary of the credit agreement terms 
in connection with entering into the credit agreement  we wrote off approximately million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreements 
these deferred financing fees were included as a component of other assets in our consolidated balance sheet  which was recorded as write off of deferred financing fees in our consolidated statements of income 
among other restrictions  the credit agreement contains financial covenants related to leverage measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings and interest coverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  additional covenants in the credit agreement include  among others  restrictions on creation of liens  limitations on acquisitions  joint ventures and other investment  limitations on restricted payments  including a prohibition on the payment of dividends by fmc  and restrictions on mergers  sales of assets and other fundamental changes 
restricted cash was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
at december  the restricted cash shown on the consolidated balance sheet provided collateral assuring the payment of certain self insurance obligations  environmental remediation activities  future business commitments  and reimbursement obligations under letters of credit supporting variable rate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds 
at or subsequent to the execution of the credit agreement  the majority of the restricted cash providing collateral supporting our obligations was released 
certain obligations were replaced with letters of credit under the credit facilities 

table of contents at december   we had term loan facility borrowings of million and no outstanding borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
letters of credit outstanding totaled million  of which million were issued under our million revolving credit facility and million were issued under our million stand alone letter of credit facility 
revolving credit facility availability was million and stand alone letter of credit availability was million at december at december   we had term loan facility borrowings of million and no outstanding borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility totaled million  resulting in availability under our revolving credit facility of million 
cash and cash equivalents  excluding restricted cash  at december  compared to december  were million and million  respectively 
the majority of cash and cash equivalents at december   were held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we had total debt of million and  million at december  and  respectively 
this included million and  million of long term debt excluding current portions of million and million at december  and  respectively 
short term debt  which consists primarily of foreign borrowings  increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the million decrease in total long term debt at december  from december  was primarily due to the repayment of our term loan facility under the former agreement 
in  we paid million  including a premium of million  plus accrued interest  to redeem all of outstanding percent senior notes due september and all of the percent series b medium term notes due december the redemption of the notes was funded with million from restricted cash 
statement of cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for and million for  primarily reflecting higher earnings 
this was offset by increased environmental spending at pocatello in during  higher cash provided by operating activities was due to lower restructuring spending of million compared to million in and changes in guarantees of vendor financing and accounts receivables sold 
because we are a global company with significant investment in the euro zone  the and increase in the euro versus the us dollar had a significant effect on the amounts of our operating assets and liabilities as presented on the balance sheets 
for better comparability  we exclude this effect in the section of the statement of cash flows entitled change in operating assets and liabilities 
cash required by discontinued operations for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites and post employment benefits for former employees of discontinued businesses 
discontinued environmental spending was million in compared to million in and million in contributing to the decline in was the absence of certain spending included in related to the spin off of technologies 
cash required by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in was due to lower astaris keepwell payments 
in addition  in  we made a million payment to elf atochem for tg soda ash  which was not repeated in the increase in from reflects an increase in financing commitments to astaris and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures in cash contributions to astaris were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for was million compared to cash required of million in in  cash provided by financing activities was million 
contributing to the increase in cash provided by financing activities in was the increase in the number of stock options exercised and higher borrowings under our foreign credit lines 
in  we paid million to redeem the entire 
table of contents outstanding balance of our percent senior notes due september  plus accrued interest and to redeem at par all of the outstanding percent series b medium term notes 
also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by financing activities as compared to was the completion of an equity offering in the second quarter of resulting in net proceeds of million  which was not repeated in for the year ended december  we contributed approximately  shares of treasury stock to our employee benefit plans having a cost of approximately million 
commitments and other potential liquidity needs our cash needs for include operating cash requirements  capital expenditures  scheduled maturities of long term debt  environmental spending and restructuring 
we expect that with these needs  our debt balances  net of cash  will be approximately million less than at year end we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash  cash generated from operations and borrowings under our million committed revolving credit facility 
in connection with the finalization of astaris external financing arrangements during the third quarter of  we entered into an agreement with astaris lenders under which we agreed to make payments keepwell payments sufficient to make up one half of the shortfall in astaris earnings below certain levels 
solutia  which owns the other percent of astaris  provided a parallel agreement under which it agreed to make up the other half of any shortfall 
astaris earnings did not meet the agreed levels for the first half of and full year and we made keepwell payments of million under this arrangement in compared to keepwell payments of million in and million in in each case  keepwell payments were applied to reduce the debt of astaris 
as previously agreed with astaris lenders  when the lenders commitments were reduced to million  in june we provided a million letter of credit in lieu of a cash keepwell payment in that amount and in the third quarter of we provided a million letter of credit 
solutia had provided a similar letter of credit in the amount of million supporting its parallel obligation 
no further keepwell payments were made in in the second half of  astaris began to implement its restructuring plan  and we recorded after tax charges of million primarily in connection with this plan 
we recorded additional after tax charges of million during related to the astaris restructuring 
in support of the astaris restructuring plan we and solutia agreed to defer until september a total of up to approximately million each in payments anticipated from astaris 
as of december   we had deferred million in payments from astaris under this program 
in december  to accommodate the financial effects on us of the astaris restructuring plan  we were successful in obtaining favorable amendments to certain covenants in our credit facilities 
along with the favorable covenant amendments  the lenders under our credit facilities agreed to reduce the applicable margin under the term loan facility by percent per annum 
in june  we received approval from our lenders for a further reduction of percent per annum in the applicable margin under the term loan facility 
in february  astaris refinanced its credit agreement and entered into a new million revolving credit agreement with a group of lenders 
in connection with this refinancing  all amounts due to us and solutia that had previously been deferred approximately million each were repaid  our obligation to make keepwell payments terminated  and our letters of credit in the amount of million previously delivered in support of this obligation were cancelled 
in connection with astaris new revolving credit agreement  solutia and we consented  subject to approval  expected in march  of solutia s consent by the bankruptcy court overseeing solutia s chapter petition 
table of contents as described below  to certain restrictions imposed by the revolving credit agreement on the ability of astaris to make certain payments to us and solutia 
these restrictions relate to the absence of a default by astaris  achievement of a minimum ebitda threshold as defined in the astaris credit agreement for the most recent four quarter period and minimum borrowing availability 
it is possible that these restrictions would delay some payments due to fmc from astaris  although we do not anticipate that any deferrals in would exceed million 
the previously agreed upon deferral agreement among astaris  solutia and us in support of the astaris restructuring plan was terminated  also subject to bankruptcy court approval 
in december  solutia filed a petition in the southern district of new york under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
since no plan of reorganization has been proposed as yet  it is unclear what effect  if any  solutia s filing will have on our interest in astaris 
astaris has reported to date  that solutia has substantially fulfilled its contractual financial obligations to astaris 
however  solutia  astaris and we are parties to several agreements  including those under which solutia manufactures certain phosphorus chemicals for astaris 
if solutia fails to perform its contractual obligations or seeks to reject these executory contracts with astaris  astaris may have to seek alternate sources of supply 
under these circumstances  astaris may have a damage claim against solutia 
there currently does not appear to be a need for future financial support by solutia to astaris 
however  if in the future astaris requires additional support from both its owners that solutia could not fulfill  this failure may in turn adversely affect astaris and our investment in the joint venture 
we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers  principally in brazil  for their seasonal borrowing 
amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as guarantees of vendor financing for december  and were million and million  respectively 
on june   we acquired the assets of tg soda ash  inc from elf atochem north america  inc elf atochem for approximately million in cash and a contingent payment due at year end based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between and on december   we made the required estimated payment in the amount of million based upon contract requirements 
this payment is subject to final adjustments based upon the audited financial statements of the business 
we do not expect this adjustment to result in any additional material payments 
we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property  plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses 
on february   we completed the sale to the city of san jose  california of approximately acres of land at our former defense systems site there 
gross proceeds from the sale were million and net proceeds after estimated offsets  fees and expenses were approximately million in the first quarter of we have an agreement with the city of san jose for the sale of the remaining approximately acres we own there 
the city s obligation to purchase the remaining land is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including a review by the california department of toxic substances control 
projected spending includes approximately million of environmental remediation spending  of which approximately million relates to pocatello  approximately million relates to the settlement of npl sites in new jersey  and approximately million relates to other operating and discontinued business sites 
this spending does not include expected spending of approximately million and million in and  respectively  on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities 
also  we expect to spend in the range of approximately million to million annually in and in for environmental compliance costs  which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves 
we agreed to guarantee the performance by technologies of certain obligations under several contracts  debt instruments  and reimbursement agreements associated with letters of credit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
as of december   these guaranteed obligations totaled million compared to million at december  we also guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign equity method investments 
the other investment owners provided parallel agreements 
as of december   these guarantees had maximum potential payments of million 

table of contents at december  and  there was million of principal amount outstanding of variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds supported by million in bank letters of credit 
in  these letters of credit were fully collateralized with cash included as part of restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
concurrently with the execution of the credit agreement  the cash collateral was released 
short term debt consisted primarily of foreign credit lines at december  and december  we provide parent company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 
our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows contractual commitments expected cash payments by year beyond total in millions debt maturities contractual interest lease obligations forward energy and foreign exchange contracts purchase obligations total excluding discounts 
contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt  which at current rates would reduce contractual interest 
we had million of long term debt subject to variable interest rates at december   excluding the effect of interest rate swaps 
the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at december  variable rates are market determined 
before recoveries 
purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  price provisions and timing of the transaction 
we have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take or pay arrangements apply 
since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take or pay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year take or pay  the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts 
contingencies during the second quarter of  we reached agreement in principle with the epa and the doj to settle certain liabilities at two environmental remediation sites in new jersey 
these agreements will be effective upon negotiation and entry of a final consent decree 
on october   solutia  our joint venture partner in astaris see note to the consolidated financial statements in the form k  filed a lawsuit against us with the circuit court of st 
louis county  missouri claiming that  among other things  we had breached our joint venture agreement due to the alleged failure of the ppa technology we contributed to astaris 
solutia dismissed this missouri lawsuit in february  after it had filed a virtually identical lawsuit in the us bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york  where its chapter case is pending 
our motion to remove the lawsuit from bankruptcy court was granted on june   and the matter is now pending in us district court for the southern district of new york 

table of contents on january  we and our wholly owned subsidiary foret received a statement of objections from the european commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in europe during the period to all of the significant european hydrogen peroxide producers also received the statement of objections 
we also received a subpoena for documents from a grand jury sitting in the northern district of california  which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the united states during the period through at this time  we do not believe the investigations are related 
in connection with these two matters  in february punitive class action complaints were filed against all of the us hydrogen peroxide producers in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws 
related cases were also filed in various state courts 
we are also party to another antitrust class action pending in federal court in the eastern district of pennsylvania  as well as various related state court cases alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose product 
dividends we paid no cash dividends in  or and we do not expect to pay dividends in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings  cash flows  and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity  interest and currency exchange rates 
to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 
we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using third party software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward foreign exchange rates as of the valuation date 
we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party 
at december   our net financial instrument position of interest rate swaps and currency and energy hedges was a net liability of million compared to a net asset of million at december  the change in the net financial instrument position was due to larger unrealized losses in our foreign currency portfolio 
commodity price risk energy costs are approximately percent of our cost of sales and services and are well balanced among coal  electricity and natural gas  and to a lesser extent  oil 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas and oil 
to analyze the effect of changing energy prices  we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december  and december  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 
a percent increase in energy market prices would result in an increase of the net asset position of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a percent decrease in energy market prices would result in a decrease of million and million in the net asset position and as a result would change the net asset position into a net liability position at december  and december   respectively 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro  the euro versus the norwegian krone  the us dollar versus the japanese yen and the us dollar versus the brazilian real 
foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business  thereby reducing our net asset exposure 
foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates  we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december  and december   with all other variables including interest rates held constant 
a percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in an increase of million and million in the net liability position at december  and december   respectively 
a percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a decrease of million and million in the net liability position and as a result would change the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december  and december   respectively 
interest rate risk one of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements 
in the agreements  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount 
in the first quarter of  we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of million 
these swaps  in which we exchange net amounts based on making payments derived from a floating rate index and receiving payments on a fixed rate basis  are used to hedge our percent senior secured notes due interest rate swaps that meet specific conditions under sfas no 
are accounted for as fair value hedges 
the termination liability of these interest rate swap agreements at december  was million 
the net termination position was not material at december  all existing fair value hedges are percent effective 
as a result  there is no effect on earnings from hedge ineffectiveness 
our debt portfolio  including interest rate swap agreements  at december  is composed of percent fixed rate debt and percent variable rate debt compared to percent fixed rate debt and percent variable rate debt at december  the variable rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of bank borrowings  variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and interest rate swap agreements entered into in the first quarter of with an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable rate debt portfolio in different ways 
based on the variable rate debt  including interest rate swap agreements  in our debt portfolio at december  and  a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates in and would increase or decrease net income by million and million  respectively
