item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation core laboratories nv is a netherlands limited liability company 
we were established in and are one of the world s leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description  production enhancement and reservoir management products and services to the oil and gas industry  primarily through customer relationships with many of the world s major  national and independent oil companies 
our business units have been aggregated into three complementary segments reservoir description encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock  fluid and gas samples 
we provide analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry 
production enhancement includes products and services relating to reservoir well completions  perforations  stimulations and production 
we provide integrated services to evaluate the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects 
reservoir management combines and integrates information from reservoir description and production enhancement services to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients reservoirs 
in april  we sold our specialized geophysical and seismic related business  which was previously included as a component of our reservoir management business 
we recorded a loss of million  net of tax  related to this discontinued operation during the year ended december  all comparative information presented for and has been restated to exclude this business line 
general overview we provide services and design and produce products which enable our clients to evaluate reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields 
these services and products are generally in higher demand when our clients are investing capital in exploration and development efforts to explore new fields or to increase productivity in existing fields 
our clients investment in capital expenditure programs tends to correlate to oil and natural gas commodity prices 
during periods of higher prices  our clients generally invest more in capital expenditures and  during periods of lower commodity prices  they tend to invest less 
accordingly  the level of capital expenditures by our clients impacts the demand for our services and products 
commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil rose throughout  as the price of a barrel of crude oil reached record highs 
consequently  activity levels in the oilfield service sector increased during the year 
rig count improved in the us markets throughout the year  and  to a lesser extent  rig count improved outside the united states 
the following table summarizes the average worldwide and us rig counts for the years ended december   and  as well as the spot price of a barrel of west texas intermediate crude and an mcf of natural gas at the dates then ended rig count oil and gas prices as of december  worldwide rig count us rig count crude oil price per barrel wti spot natural gas price spot average per mcf baker hughes incorporated world wide averages obtained from lehman brothers the original oil service monthly for and  cushing wti crude spot at per the us department of energy and henry hub spot price at per the new york mercantile exchange the price of natural gas in was consistent with the price in  but relatively high compared to these higher prices in and were attributable to various market factors including a general decline in natural gas production in recent years  evidenced by lower production rates from maturing fields and combined with steeper decline curves from newly discovered fields 
general oil and gas market conditions in the united states improved and contributed to general price increases for oil and gas products in oil prices per barrel of unrefined crude continued to climb to record levels due to increased demand and concerns over supply 
our activity levels continue to increase as oilfield activities by our customers increase 
these higher activity levels resulted in increased revenues for us in  primarily for our reservoir description and production enhancement business segments 
given these higher revenues  in conjunction with efforts to contain our cost structure  we were able to generate operating income that was greater than the prior year 
our reservoir description segment showed improvement in almost all operations  primarily as a result of the spending levels of our clients aimed at characterizing and analyzing reservoirs  crude oil  and derivative products 
operating income from our production enhancement segment was up over the prior year as more wells in north america were drilled and stimulated than in the prior year  which provides greater opportunity for our clients to use our products and services 
in april  we sold our seismic business  which had become less profitable in recent years  due to increased competition which contributed to lower margins 
the results for our reservoir management group improved over prior year due primarily to a re focus of our efforts on integrated solutions for clients 
outlook we continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening strategic facilities and realizing synergies within our business lines 
as companies in the oil and gas industry consolidate  some of our clients have used  and may continue to use  their global presence and market influence to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions 
we believe our market presence provides us a unique opportunity to service these customers 
we have established internal earnings targets that are based on current market conditions 
based on discussions with our clients and our view of the industry  we anticipate that in north american spending by our clients will increase approximately  up slightly from we believe that the activity levels outside of north america will increase slightly compared to levels as we expand our international revenue base through direct product sales and technical services 
however  attaining our internal targets is dependent on sustained north american and international oilfield activity 
we expect to meet ongoing working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and funding of our share repurchase program from a combination of cash on hand  cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us and require us to make estimates and assumptions during their preparation which requires judgment 
our accounting policies and procedures are explained in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following transaction types require significant judgment and  therefore  are considered critical accounting policies as of december  revenue recognition revenues are recognized as services are completed or as product title is transferred 
all advance client payments are classified as unearned revenues until services are performed or product title is transferred 
we recognize revenue when we determine that the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from long term contracts are recorded as services are rendered in proportion to the work performed 
all known or anticipated losses on contracts are provided for currently 
training and consulting service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and monitor collections and payments in order to maintain a provision for estimated uncollectible accounts based on our historical collection experience and our current aging of client receivables outstanding in addition to clients representations and our understanding of the economic environment in which our clients operate 
based on our review  we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable as a whole 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was million compared to million at december  long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
major renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the respective asset s remaining useful life 
maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred 
when long lived assets are sold or retired  the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income 
property  plant and equipment held and used is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable over the remaining service life 
indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle use or significant declines in activity levels in regions where specific assets or groups of assets are located 
provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when the net book value of the assets  or carrying value  is determined to be unrecoverable and the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the calculation of fair value requires estimates of future cash flows  and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
we did not record impairment charges related to our long lived assets held for use in continuing operations during the years ended december   or we review impairment of our goodwill  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations  at least annually for impairment or more frequently if an event occurs which may indicate impairment during the year 
we evaluated assets with indefinite lives  including goodwill and certain intangible assets  for impairment comparing the fair value of our reportable segments to their net carrying value as of the balance sheet date  after excluding inter company transactions and allocating corporate assets to the reportable segments 
fair value is determined by projecting future cash flows on a discounted basis 
if the carrying value of the reportable segment exceeds the fair value determined  an impairment may be indicated 
if impairment is indicated  the fair value of the reportable segment would be determined 
any remaining goodwill would be deemed impaired and charged to income during the period the impairment was identified 
upon adoption o f statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 in the first quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million  primarily related to our reservoir management segment  which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the year ended december  any subsequent impairment loss could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
inventory valuation allowances our valuation reserve for inventory is based on historical regional sales trends  and various other assumptions and judgments including future demand for this inventory 
should these assumptions and judgments not come to fruition  our valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect actual results 
the industry we operate in is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory 
our valuation reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  if we over or underestimate demand for inventory  it could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes our income tax expense includes income taxes of the netherlands  the us and other foreign countries as well as local  state and provincial income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is recovered or the liability is settled 
any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances of our net deferred tax assets aggregated million and million at december  and  respectively 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase which could re sult in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
stock options we apply accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which does not require us to recognize compensation costs related to employee stock options which have exercise prices at least equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  we have not recognized compensation cost for our stock options issued 
we have  however  included option shares in the diluted shares outstanding calculation that is used to determine diluted earnings per share 
we are not required to account for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accounting for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
would negatively impact our financial position and results of operations  as it requires that the fair value of stock options issued be estimated using pricing models that have an inherent degree of uncertainty  and that expense be recognized over the vesting period of the related options 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
and supercedes abp opinion no 
this statement will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  with limited exceptions 
this statement becomes effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are currently evaluating the impact that this statement will have on our financial position and results of operations 
we expect to incur expenses related to our stock options for each reporting period subsequent to our adoption of this standard in the third quarter of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and determine the adequacy of our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
by nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it is highly subjective and if changes in the estimate under different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following table summarizes key estimates and assumptions used to prepare our consolidated financial statements for the years ended decemb er   and account nature of estimates required assumptions used allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate whether client receivables are collectible 
see allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves we forecast client demand  considering changes in technology which could result in obsolescence 
see inventory valuation allowance 
depreciation and amortization we estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
useful lives assigned reflect our best estimate based on historical data of the respective asset s useful life and salvage value 
these assets could become impaired if our operating plans or business environment changes 
income taxes we estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets particularly  net operating loss carry forwards 
we examine our historical and projected operating results  review eligible carry forward period and tax planning opportunities and consider other relevant information 
changes in tax laws for the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly impact our estimates 
long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of our assets periodically  but at least annually  by examining current and projected operating results to identify any triggering events  which may indicate impairment 
we compare the carrying value of the assets to a projection of fair value  utilizing judgment as to the identification of reporting units  the allocation of corporate assets amongst reporting units and the determination of the appropriate discount rate 
see long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill 
our impairment analysis is subjective and includes estimates based on assumptions regarding future growth rates and operating expenses 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we utilize an actuary to determine the value of the projected benefit obligation under a dutch pension plan 
this valuation requires various estimates and assumptions concerning mortality  future pay increases and discount rate used to value our obligations 
in addition  we recognize net periodic benefit cost based upon these estimates 
the actuarial assumptions used are based upon professional judgment and historical experience  including trends in mortality rates  and credit market rates discount rate 
off balance sheet arrangements we hold investments in unconsolidated affiliates whose operations are in line with those of our core businesses 
our investment and operating percentages in these entities are included in our consolidated financial statements 
these entities are not considered special purpose entities nor do we have special off balance sheet arrangements through these entities 
they are not consolidated due to the limited influence we have in making management decisions 
results of operations results of operations as a percentage of applicable revenues are as follows dollars in thousands year ended change revenues services product sales operating expenses cost of services cost of sales total cost of services and sales general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization other income expense  net operating income interest expense income before income tax expense income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations nm nm cumulative effect of change in accounting principle nm net income loss percentage based on applicable revenue rather than total revenue 
nm means not meaningful 
operating results for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and we evaluate our operating results by analyzing revenues  operating income margin defined as operating income divided by total revenue and income margin defined as income from continuing operations divided by total revenue 
since we have a relatively fixed cost structure  increases in revenues generally translate into higher operating income margin and income margin percentages 
results for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following chart 
imagegif 
service revenues service revenues increased to million for from million for and million for these year over year increases in service revenues were largely attributable to an overall increase in worldwide oilfield activities and increasing oil and gas commodity prices 
the average north american operating rig count increased to  for from  for and  for  derived from published reports from baker hughes incorporated 
this overall increase in drilling related activity and in commodity prices created greater demand for our services 
our revenues increased in primarily related to our operations in the united states and canada  largely attributable to sales of diagnostic services and fluid characterization  and increased revenues in europe and south america 
for compared to  our service revenue increases were largely related to our north american operations 
product sale revenues product sale revenues increased to million for from million for and million for these incremental improvements in revenue were consistent with the higher revenues we experienced for our services  and represent a year over year increase over the three year period ended december   and was largely attributable to the overall increase in north american oilfield activities  particularly an increase in drilling activity for natural gas 
as a result  we experienced higher demand for our well completion products 
cost of services cost of services increased to million for from million for and million for year over year percentage increases in cost of services were consistent with the percentage increases in service revenues for the respective periods 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million for from million for and million for as a percentage of product sale revenues  cost of sales declined to for compared to for and for the improvement in margin for compared to was largely attributable to efforts in to enhance our manufacturing efficiencies 
the improvement in margin for compared to was primarily due to a favorable change in sales mix which included an increase in demand for our higher margin perforating products 
in addition  margins were negatively impacted in by significant currency devaluation in venezuela 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses include corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operating subsidiaries 
our general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to this increase was primarily associated with stock based compensation plans and increased outside services and consulting costs incurred to assist us with documentation and assessment of the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  as required by the sarbanes oxley act of general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to  primarily related to costs incurred under our executive retirement plans  legal fees related to class action lawsuits and costs attributable to the implementation of our company wide information system 
as of december   we had not recognized expense of million associated with certain stock based compensation arrangements  as we cannot determine whether the underlying performance measures will be met  and cannot assert that it is probable that these measures will be met during the performance period as defined in the agreements 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we have not accrued this cost at december  for further discussion of our stock based compensation plans  see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to this decline in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily associated with a decline in capital expenditures in compared to  and a general run off of depreciation expense associated with older assets 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to this increase was primarily associated with increased capital expenditures in other income expense  net the components of other income expense  net  were as follows in thousands year ended minority interest loss on sale of assets equity in loss earnings of affiliates foreign exchange gain loss interest income other total other income expense  net interest expense interest expense increased million in compared to  due to higher borrowing rates under our long term revolving credit facility  which increased to an average of for compared to an average of for interest expense for was consistent with the amount for income tax expense income tax expense increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase in net income before income taxes of million 
the effective tax rate was for  for and for for  income tax expense increased million compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase in net income before income taxes of million  partially offset by a decrease in tax expense associated with certain non recurring nondeductible expenses that were incurred in as well as higher international earnings taxed at rates lower than the netherlands statutory rate 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we recorded the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle totaling million  net of tax  in upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we ceased amortization of goodwill and recorded an impairment charge associated with goodwill primarily associated with our reservoir management business segment 
this impairment was reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  as prescribed by sfas no 
discontinued operations as a result of the sale of our seismic business in april  we recorded a loss for discontinued operations totaling million  net of tax 
this loss included charges related to the impairment of goodwill  certain intangible assets and other long lived assets totaling million and a charge of million to the provision for doubtful accounts  as well as other working capital adjustments 
in and  results related to the discontinued operations resulted in a loss of million and million  respectively

reservoir description revenues for our reservoir description segment increased by in compared to  and grew in compared to these revenue increases resulted from increased oilfield activity during recent years 
a significant portion of the revenues earned by this business segment are derived from core samples tested and inspection services performed for oil and gas industry clients 
we experienced higher revenues in north america  europe and the far east  partially offset by a revenue decline in mexico  where several contracts expired 
revenue growth in north america was primarily attributable to increased demand for our inspection and analysis services by our clients as well as demand for core analysis throughout north america 
revenue increases in europe and the far east were primarily due to improved economic conditions in the sectors where our clients operate  which resulted in increased demand for our inspection and analysis services 
for compared to  our revenu es increased in the former soviet union  europe and africa and as a result of new business in the asia pacific region 
in africa  revenue gains were attributable to increased activity in nigeria  combined with the introduction of new technology 
in canada  our revenues grew due to several large oil sand projects 
these increases were partially offset by a poor political climate in venezuela 
operating income and operating income margin for the reservoir description segment increased primarily as a result of incremental margins earned on higher revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure 
increases in north america and europe more than offset operating income declines in mexico and certain regions of the former soviet union  where we continued to experience margin erosion due to increased competition 
for compared to  operating income declined primarily due to margin erosion in the former soviet union  europe and africa as a result of competitive pricing  as the market for oil and gas services continued to develop 
production enhancement revenues for our production enhancement business segment grew in compared to  primarily due to the introduction of new technology and as a result of increased oilfield activities in north america  resulting in higher demand for our perforating gun systems and hydraulic fracture diagnostic services  the primary products and services offered by this segment 
revenues increased by in when compared to primarily due to increased oilfield activity in north america and mexico 
operating income for this segment increased in compared to higher operating income for was due primarily to manufacturing efficiencies which contributed to incremental margins earned on revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure and a more favorable product mix 
these factors resulted in an increase in operating income margins to in compared to in the product mix in was impacted by increased sales of higher margin services and products including new enhanced recovery technology  such as spectraflood  and our hero perforating charge and gun systems 
operating income and margin for were favorable compared to primarily due to the improvements in the north american markets in reservoir management revenues for our reservoir management segment increased in compared to  but declined in compared to these results reflect the cyclical nature of our integrated multi disciplinary reservoir studies business  as sales can vary depending upon the number of studies in process and the level of participation by our clients 
significant studies in included a regional study of the reservoir lithologies from fields and basins in libya  as well as reservoir quality  reservoir quality prediction and seal rock evaluation deep shelf gulf of mexico and several other proprietary studies 
in  fewer studies were in progress compared to operating income for this segment increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in revenues from our integrated multi disciplinary studies  and participation of our clients in those projects 
operating income increased in compared to primarily due to the transition to higher margin projects in liquidity and capital resources general we have historically financed our activities through cash on hand  cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities  equity financing and the issuance of debt 
cash flow from operating activities provides the primary source of funds to finance operating needs  capital expenditures and our share repurchase program 
if necessary  we supplement this cash flow with borrowings under bank credit facilities to finance some capital expenditures and business acquisitions 
as we are a netherlands holding company  we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries 
our cash flow is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us 
we utilize the non gaap financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations 
free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures 
management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it represents the cash  in excess of capital expenditures  available to operate the business and fund non discretionary obligations 
the following table reconciles this non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for the years ended december   and year ended december  free cash flow calculation unaudited  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations capital expenditures free cash flow the increase in free cash flow in compared to and was due to increased net income and a decrease in capital expenditures partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by operating activities  as discussed below 
working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
excluding assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations at december  and  working capital would have been million and million  respectively 
cash flows the following table summarizes cash flows from continuing operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  continuing operations unaudited  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents the decrease in cash flow from operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the timing of payments related to accrued expenses  which contributed a larger net cash in flow in  and the impact of inventory  which required the use of cash in of million compared to a source of operating cash flow in of million  partially offset by an increase in net income from continuing operations 
management monitors inventory levels as well as inventory turnover using the number of days of sales in inventory  which has improved approximately during for compared to  our cash from operating activities increased due to higher net income and improved overall working capital management 
cash flow used for investing activities declined to million for compared to million for this overall decline was due to the use of only million for acquisitions in compared to million in  and a million decline in capital expenditures 
significant capital expenditures in included million related to an upgrade of our company wide information system  and new facilities located in godley  texas and amsterdam totaling million 
purchase acquisitions in included the assets of goex for approximately million 
capital expenditures increased in compared to  during which we incurred capital expenditures of million 
significant capital expenditures in included a lab and office facility in russia for approximately million 
cash flow used by financing activities increased in compared to  as our net borrowings declined in in  our financing activities reflected a net repayment of million of debt  while financing activities reflected net borrowings of million 
in  we used million to repurchase  shares of our common stock  while in we used million to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
this share repurchase program was approved by our shareholders at our annual meeting in may and began on october  under the program  we were authorized to repurchase up to of our outstanding common shares 
this authorization was extended by our shareholders at our annual meetings in may  a special meeting in october and again in june cash flow used by financing activities in reflected the repurchase of  shares of our common stock  or an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
at our june annual meeting of shareholders  we were authorized to continue our share repurchase program up to of our outstanding common shares through december  in addition  we were authorized to cancel  of these repurchased shares  with a cost of million 
pursuant to this authorization  these shares were cancelled during the third quarter of during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of million  or an average price of per share 
as of february  we had authority to repurchase  additional shares 
the repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management 
we regard these treasury shares as a temporary investment which may be used to finance future acquisitions 
however  under the dutch commercial code dcc  we can only hold a maximum of of our outstanding shares in treasury 
therefore  it may be necessary to cancel som e or all of these shares to remain in compliance with the dcc 
we believe this share repurchase program has been beneficial to our shareholders 
our share price has increased from per share when the program was announced in to per share on december   an increase of approximately 
we recorded a net cash inflow of million as a result of our discontinued operations which included million of proceeds from the sale of the specialized geophysical and seismic business and cash received from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit  partially offset by a use of operating cash flows 
credit facilities and available future liquidity we maintain a million revolving credit facility the credit facility  which we entered into in july in june  we amended this facility to reduce our borrowing capacity to million from million but added an option to increase our borrowing capacity to million if certain conditions are met 
the credit facility bears interest at variable rates from libor plus to a maximum of libor plus 
at december   the weighted average interest rate of amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 
the weighted average interest rate under this facility was for the year ended december  the credit facility matures in june and requires interest payments only until maturity 
these interest payments are based on the interest period selected 
our available borrowing capacity under the credit facility at december  was million 
our available capacity is reduced by outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds totaling million at december  related to certain projects in progress 
in july  we issued million in senior notes  million series a and million series b senior notes  that bear an average fixed rate of and require annual principal payments of million for series a beginning on july   continuing annually through july  and million for series b beginning on july  and continuing annually through july  in addition to semi annual interest payments 
the principal payment of approximately million which is due under our senior notes facility on july  which falls within one year of december   has been classified as long term as of december   as management expects to refinance this obligation with borrowings under the credit facility 
the terms of the credit facility and senior notes require us to meet certain financial covenants  including  but not limited to  certain operational and minimum equity and cash flow ratios 
we believe that we are in compliance with all such covenants contained in our credit agreements 
all of our material wholly owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co borrowers under both debt agreements 
we have unsecured letters of credit  performance guarantees and bonds totaling million at december  in addition to our repayment commitments under our credit facilities  we have capital lease obligations related to the purchase of equipment  and non cancelable operating lease arrangements under which we lease property including land  buildings  office equipment and vehicles 
the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations under these arrangements total less than year years years more than years unaudited  in thousands contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases pension and other a total contractual obligations a our dutch pension plan requires annual employer contributions 
amounts payable in the future will be based on future workforce factors which cannot be projected beyond one year 
we have no significant purchase commitments or similar obligations outstanding at december  we had tax net operating loss carry forwards in various tax jurisdictions of approximately million at december  if unused  those carry forwards which are subject to expiration may expire during the years through for  million of operating loss carry forwards expired unused 
although we cannot assure that these operating loss carry forwards will be utilized  we anticipate that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to fully utilize the carry forwards that are not subject to a valuation allowance as of december we expect our investment in capital expenditures to be approximately million in in addition  we plan to continue to repurchase our common shares on the open market through our stock repurchase program 
our ability to continue this repurchase program depends on  among other things  market conditions and our ability to generate free cash flow 
our ability to maintain and increase our operating income and cash flows is largely dependent upon continued investing activities 
we believe our future cash flows from operating activities  supplemented by our borrowing capacity under existing facilities and our ability to issue additional equity should be sufficient to meet our contractual obligations  capital expenditures  working capital needs and to finance future acquisitions 
accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
and supercedes apb no 
this statement will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  with limited exceptions 
the fair value of the award will be remeasured at each reporting date through the settlement date  with changes in fair value recognized as compensation expense of the period 
entities should continue to use an option pricing model to determine fair value as of the grant date of the stock options 
this statement becomes effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are currently evaluating the impact that this statement will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this pronouncement amends previous guidance to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  shipping and handling costs and spoilage  and generally requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this pronouncement requires that fixed production overhead allocations to conversion costs be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement becomes effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   and will be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment of sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this amendment requires additional annual disclosures about pension or postretirement plan assets and liabilities  disclosure of investment policies and strategies for plan assets  basis for expected rate of return on assets and total accumulated benefit obligation under the plan 
in addition  entities must disclose the benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five years under each pension or postretirement plan and the aggregate amount expected to be paid for the succeeding five year period 
furthermore  this pronouncement requires interim disclosures of the components of net periodic benefit cost in tabular format and contributions paid or expected to be paid during the current fiscal year 
this pronouncement becomes effective for foreign plans for years ending after june  see note  pensions and other postretirement benefits  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for these disclosures 
in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this consensus addresses certain aspects of accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities  specifically  how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf issue became effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we adopted eitf issue on january  with no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements  including guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that upon issuance of certain types of guarantees  a guarantor recognize and account for the fair value of the guarantee as a liability
