iss  through its regional offices provides field level design  installation and maintenance of both physical and electronic security products 
included in the institutional security systems segment is the trentech line which designs  manufactures and integrates electronic security systems 
trentech integrates generally available products and software as well as designing its own proprietary systems 
trentech has developed a sophisticated proprietary video badging system  with approximately systems installed at facilities  including military installations 
the institutional security systems segment also manufactures a complete line of locks and locking devices under the brand name airteq 
airteq is an industry leader in pneumatic and electro mechanical sliding devices used in the corrections industry 
the attack protection segment is one of the country s largest manufacturers of bullet  blast and attack resistant windows and doors designed for high security applications such as embassies  courthouses  federal buildings  banks  corporate headquarters and other facilities that insist on having the highest level of protection currently available 
we believe that we are a premier provider of underwriters laboratory ballistic standard ul level security windows and doors  the highest rating level of commercial ballistic security windows and doors 
our attack resistant windows and doors are integrated and structurally secure products with specifically designed frames and encasements that are integral parts of the structure in which they are installed 
existing product installations number in the thousands and range from the middle east to the white house 
working under contracts from prime contractors who have direct contracts with the united states department of state  the segment s largest client  attack protection is a significant supplier of bullet and blast resistant windows and doors to united states embassies throughout the world 
attack protection products are also sold to drug stores  convenience stores  and banks to secure drive through facilities 
other commercial applications include guard booths  tollbooths  cash drawers and other similar items 
additionally  this segment designs and installs both fixed and pop up bollards and wedge barrier security systems 
the attack protection segment also manufactures a sophisticated fiber optic sensor system  known as fiber sensys  used to detect physical intrusion 
this application is designed to protect large perimeters including such applications as federal facilities  military deployments and bases  oil fields  airport tarmacs  public utilities  nuclear reactors and water systems 
in addition  it has been installed to protect the perimeters of numerous private estates and other similar properties 
the federal security systems segment is known as quanta systems corporation

federal security systems provides central station oversight and control of multiple and separate facilities as well as security and public life safety systems and equipment 
this segment designs and manufactures advanced digital signal processing products used in reconnaissance of foreign telecommunications signals designed for the united states government and its foreign allies 
the public safety and justice segment consists of corrlogic inc  tiburon  inc 
and the recently acquired assets of degrees and copperfire 
we believe that corrlogic is a leading developer of inmate management and institutional medical software systems 
corrlogic specializes in the development  implementation and support of complex  integrated inmate management software systems  including inmate medical management systems that improve the efficiency and accuracy of correctional facility operations 
corrlogic s focus is entirely on information solutions for the corrections industry 
during compudyne expanded its offerings in the public safety and justice sector by completing its acquisition of tiburon  inc tiburon provides a fully integrated suite of products including computer assisted dispatch  records management  court and probation software systems for the law enforcement  fire and rescue  corrections and justice environments 
the company believes tiburon is a worldwide market leader in the development  implementation and support of public safety and justice automation systems 
in business since  with more than systems supporting approximately active clients  tiburon is a leader in public safety and justice solutions 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we expanded our offerings in the public safety and justice sector by completing our acquisition of the assets of degrees and copperfire  respectively 
degrees provides a web based fire records management system  which is being integrated into our current ps j product offerings 
degrees enterprise wide records management solutions assist fire and ems agencies in managing responses to emergency situations 
we anticipate that as we integrate degrees product offerings into our ps j product offerings  the open web based technology from degrees will advance our current fire and rescue product offerings 
copperfire provides customized report writing and forms generation software designed specifically for public safety and justice agencies 
the software automates an agency s current business practices  turning hard copy forms into digital images  to create a paperless report writing system 
we believe that integration of copperfire s products will enhance our total offerings in ps j 
management outlook we continue to find ourselves in very challenging times 
we have four major areas of focus o the first is increasing the amount of our backlog 
o the second is migrating to a business model with a more predictable revenue stream 
o the third is finding attractive acquisition candidates to enhance our existing business 
o the fourth is to improve our cost structure  quality  and customer and employee satisfaction 
we are continuing to experience a decline in our overall backlog 
our backlog is a key indicator of what our future revenues will look like 
our backlog peaked at december   at which time it exceeded million 
since then it has continued to decline and although it saw a slight increase at the ends of the second and third quarters in  it slipped to approximately million at december  as shown in the following table institutional federal public security attack security safety and backlog in thousands systems protection systems justice total december       march       june       september       december       march       june       september       december       historically  approximately of our revenues were generated from sources where the ultimate client is a federal  state or local government unit 
during the last few years  due to the general economic slowdown  state and local budgets  which we are dependent on for our revenue sources  have come under intense pressure 
most states are currently running in a deficit situation  as are many local governments 
this has caused many of them to delay and in some cases cancel many infrastructure projects until such time as their economic fortunes rebound 
until the economy improves for several quarters and until state and local budgets improve  we would anticipate our backlog levels continuing to remain under pressure 
to address this area of focus we are actively bidding on jobs and keeping our offerings in front of our clients so that when or if the current government budget cycle turns around  we will be well positioned to capitalize on new opportunities 
our second area of focus surrounds reengineering our business model so that it contains a greater degree of recurring revenue 
as indicated in the following table  approximately of our revenue was generated from recurring revenue sources primarily maintenance revenues  and the majority of these revenues occurred in our public safety and justice segment 
we define one time revenue as revenue derived from discrete projects  from which we do not expect to generate incremental revenue upon the completion of the project 
we define recurring revenue as sources of revenue from which we anticipate receiving revenue in the current  as well as future periods  for example annual renewable maintenance contracts 
year ended december  in thousands one time revenue recurring revenue total institutional security systems    attack protection   federal security systems   public safety and justice    total    since the majority of our revenues are one time revenues and are non recurring  we must reinvent our book of business on a continual basis 
this makes it very difficult for us to project our future revenue stream and thus makes it very difficult for us to project our earnings as well as our business outlook 
over the next five years  we intend to modify our business model to rely less upon one time sources of revenue and more on recurring sources of revenue 
in this regard  in july we hired a chief operating officer coo 
the coo position is a newly created position within compudyne 
our new coo  mr 
maurice boukelif  brings extensive manufacturing and operational experience to us 
under his leadership  we are hopeful we will be able to transform this business model in the next few years 
our third key focus area is acquisitions 
with the january completion of the convertible subordinated notes due january   the notes offering  we have resources available with which to fund acquisitions 
we are particularly interested in three areas 
o the first is a business that would either prove additive or complementary to our current offerings in the public safety and justice segment 
although this segment has seen a decline in its backlog over the prior two years  we anticipate this segment will be one of the first to see a recovery 
we envision this segment as being a growth segment for our business 
our assessment is that the demands of our nation s first responders will grow in the foreseeable future 
furthermore  this business is characterized by strong recurring revenues  which as discussed above is one of our key business drivers 
o second  we are continually looking for companies that have attractive security technology based products that we can leverage by offering the technology to our existing clients and markets 
o the third type of business we are interested in acquiring is a high end commercial security integrator 
our primary clientele are currently governmental units 
throughout all our segments other than public safety and justice which is involved in a different market  over the years we have developed significant skills as it relates to security integration and applications 
our offerings however are sold almost exclusively to various governmental units 
we believe that the purchase of the right high end commercial security integrator would give us a market entree whereby we would be able to offer many of our existing offerings into the private sector  a wholly new business arena for us  and one that we believe is not served as well as the governmental arena to which we have heretofore dedicated ourselves 
our fourth focus area is to improve our cost structure  quality  and client and employee satisfaction 
our institutional security business segment is undergoing a significant organizational and expense restructuring  including a partial consolidation of regional office efforts and an increased focus on centralized performance of the most complicated security projects 
this initiative begins by ensuring our organization is properly aligned with our clients needs 
many changes have been made and initial results indicate that our cost  our quality  our clients and our employees are responding favorably to the changes implemented thus far 
we have much room for improvement as we move toward a more client centric organization 
the organization re alignment is critical to strengthening our future as it allows us to deploy the six sigma methodology across all our business segments more efficiently 
the six sigma methodology focuses on defect elimination  which will have a direct impact on our cost  quality  and client satisfaction 
we believe that if we address and implement successfully the above four areas of focus  we will significantly enhance our future growth opportunities and will provide for more predictable financial results 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we expanded our offerings in the public safety and justice sector by completion of our acquisition of the assets of degrees and copperfire respectively 
degrees provides a web based fire records management system  which is being integrated into our current ps j product offerings 
degrees enterprise wide records management solutions assist fire and ems agencies in managing responses to emergency situations 
we anticipate that as we integrate degrees product offerings into our ps j product offerings  the open web based technology from degrees will advance our current fire and rescue product offerings 
copperfire provides customized report writing and forms generation software designed specifically for public safety and justice agencies 
the software automates an agency s current business practices  turning hard copy forms into digital images  to create a paperless report writing system 
we believe that integration of copperfire s products will enhance our total offerings in public safety and justice 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
the company had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
as discussed below  most of this decline occurred in our iss segment due to delayed projects at the state and local levels  largely caused by significant budget deficits many governmental units are currently experiencing 
revenues from the institutional security systems segment were million in the year ended december   a decrease from million for the same period of representing a decrease of million or 
the institutional security systems segment is largely a construction driven business 
much of its revenue is obtained by working on new and retrofit construction projects in the corrections industry  as opposed to sources of recurring revenue 
as such  the decrease in revenue experienced by this segment is largely attributable to our working on less projects than we did in the previous year 
the principal reason for the decline was that its backlog had decreased from million at december  to million at december  thus resulting in less work available to be performed in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  backlog at december  had declined further to million 
the years and have been slow bidding periods for the company 
although the gross amount of construction spending in the corrections area remained relatively flat between  and  the types of projects that the company solicits  namely large scale medium to maximum security installations  declined in and this situation was further compounded by the general state and local governmental budget deficits which are causing these governmental units to rethink and delay many of their pending corrections projects 
revenues from the attack protection segment were million in the year ended december   a decrease from million for the same period of representing a decrease of million or 
in the company purchased an existing  square foot factory for the attack protection segment on acres of land in close proximity to its existing factory in montgomery  alabama 
this capacity increase was largely driven by the company s expectation that the demands for its products  principally its bullet and blast resistant windows and doors would accelerate significantly in the post september  world 
throughout  and this anticipated increase in demand did not materialize leaving the segment with significant excess capacity 
this segment is composed of two chief product offerings  namely norshield  which encompasses bullet and blast resistant windows and doors and ancillary products  and fiber sensys  which encompasses fiber optic intrusion detection systems 
for the year ended december  the norshield line experienced a decline in revenues as compared to the year ended december   whereas the fiber sensys line experienced a increase in revenues for the comparable period 
the company continues to see heightened interest for its fiber sensys products and expects sales for these items to continue to experience sustainable growth 
the slow down in the government building process experienced during and appears to have stabilized 
it appears that projects are being released for construction  and thus the attack protection segment is experiencing increased bidding activity for its products 
during the company furnished bids to supply its products for eight new embassy projects 
at the time  this was the largest number of embassy projects bid in a single calendar year for this segment 
through december   the company was awarded four of these embassy projects  for a total compudyne contract value of million  and lost the remaining four embassy projects 
during  we bid on fifteen new embassy projects 
through march the company was awarded six of these embassy projects for a total contract value of million  and lost seven embassy projects to competitors  with two projects still awaiting award 
in  preliminary indications show eighteen embassy projects will be available for bid 
it appears to us that this increased level of new embassy construction will continue for the next several years 
revenues from the federal security systems segment were million in the year ended december   a decrease from million for the same period of representing a decrease of million or 
a significant portion of this segment s revenue is backlog driven 
the federal security systems segment ended with a backlog level of million 
backlog at december  was million and at december  was also million 
revenues from the public safety and justice segment were million in the year ended december   a decrease from million for the same period of representing a decrease of million or 
in  the company recognized approximately million of revenue related to hardware supplied under a contract with one of its customers 
minimal margin was earned on this hardware 
although ps j ships certain hardware components to clients on an occasional basis  shipments of this magnitude of hardware  done to accommodate our client  is an unusual and non routine event 
in addition  it should be noted that although we made two acquisitions in this segment in degrees and copperfire  these acquisitions had little impact on public safety and justice s revenues due to their relatively small size and due to their occurring in the later part of the year 
expenses 
cost of goods sold of million in the year ended december  were down million or from million during the same period of this decrease was a result of decreased costs of goods sold of million at the institutional security systems segment  largely attributable to the decreased sales of this segment 
the smaller percentage decrease in sales as compared to the percentage decrease in cost of goods sold resulted in an increased gross profit percentage of for the year ended december  as compared to in cost of goods sold in the institutional security systems segment of million for the year ended december  were down million or from million during the same period of this decrease was less than the related sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in a decrease in the gross profit percentage to from in the year ended december  starting in and continuing through  institutional security systems senior management identified managerial problems at its west coast operations and determined that numerous problems existed there including that the costs to complete its projects were going to be significantly higher than was previously projected 
this was a result of significant cost overruns on many of these projects 
as the work on the projects progressed  the institutional security systems segment identified additional cost overruns which would cause the costs to complete these projects to increase as a result of the changes in the estimates to complete 
although the problem projects identified in are substantially all complete  the problems in the iss west coast operations continued into and we realized that the management changes made in did not adequately address the root problems identified  and as a result  projects started after continued to experience cost overruns due to a lack of appropriate oversight 
staff and management changes in iss are ongoing 
we have revised our estimates to complete these project and believe that all future costs on these projects have been adequately considered through december  the west coast problems  including project overruns  resulted in losses recorded in the following periods in thousands second half of  first half of  third quarter of fourth quarter of  first quarter of  second quarter of  third quarter of  fourth quarter of  total west coast losses  to address this situation  the company is implementing more centralized controls  replaced certain personnel at its west coast operations and its alabama headquarters  and hired a chief operating officer 
cost of goods sold in the attack protection segment of million for the year ended december  increased million or from million during the same period of this increase occurred in spite of a sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in a decrease in the gross profit percentage to from during the year ended december  we are actively working to better utilize the  square foot factory the company purchased in montgomery  alabama 
the airteq manufacturing operation in oregon was relocated in the latter part of and consolidated into this facility 
this was done in an effort to enhance the utilization of our owned facilities in alabama and thus absorb some of our excess manufacturing capacity 
although not the primary contributor  this did result in further utilization of approximately  square feet of previously unused manufacturing space in this plant in alabama 
in addition  we identified  in late  a quality problem with the windows and doors being installed on a project ultimately completed in the fourth quarter of as a result of this identified problem  we took remedial action in the field to repair this defect 
during the year ended december  we increased our estimated cost to complete this project by million thus causing this project to become a negative margin project 
cumulative write downs on this project amount to million 
cost of goods sold in the federal security systems segment of million in the year ended december  decreased million or from million during the same period of this decrease was less than the related sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in a decrease in the gross profit percentage to from in the year ended december  substantially all of the projects awarded in this segment are discrete projects 
cost of goods sold in the public safety and justice segment of million for the year ended december  was down million or from million during this decrease was more than the related sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in an increase in the gross profit percentage to from in the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  our public safety and justice segment received a complaint alleging that we breached our contract to provide a public safety software system to a client 
as a result  we recorded a million pre tax charge  of which thousand was recorded as a reduction of revenue and million was recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
during the second quarter of this matter was settled  resulting in a reversal of million of the accrued charge  which was reflected as a reduction of cost of sales 
the net of this activity contributed million of the million gross profit improvement in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from million for the same period of much of this increase is related to additional costs incurred by the company related to legal fees in connection with responding to and settling the complaint filed by a public safety and justice segment client  expenses incurred in connection with evaluating potential acquisitions  recruiting fees incurred to fill the recently hired coo position and other senior management positions and expenses related to compliance with new requirements mandated by the sarbanes oxley act and the sec 
during the fourth quarter of the company concluded that the continuing decline in the backlog in its iss segment constituted a triggering event which caused the company to conclude it was necessary to reassess and ultimately write off goodwill in the amount of million and certain other intangibles in the amount of million 
those amounts appear as a separate line item in the statement of operations 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the assets of degrees and copperfire and in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas business combinations  the company preliminarily determined the fair value of the following identifiable assets and assigned the indicated lives for the purposes of amortization and depreciation 
amount in thousands life in years software  employment contracts the amortization of the above assets resulted in the company recording amortization expense related to these assets of thousand in  which is included in operating expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from million for the same period of being a technology driven enterprise  the company s public safety and justice segment continually updates and enhances its software offerings  thus incurring significant research and development costs 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to an increase in borrowings and overall higher interest rates 
the following table compares the weighted average of the company s years ended december  and december  interest bearing borrowings and the related rates charged thereon 
monthly weighted monthly weighted average average amount rate amount rate in thousands in thousands bank borrowings  industrial revenue bonds   subordinated borrowings  swap hedge agreement   in addition the company recorded the following non cash interest expense amortization and write off of deferred financing charges taxes on income 
the effective tax benefit was approximately for the year ended december  and the effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended december  the difference in rates is largely attributable to the losses experienced in and the related valuation allowance established for substantially all of the company s net deferred tax assets as of december net loss income 
the company reported net loss income of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reason for the loss in was the significant decline in revenues 
while the company was able to significantly reduce its cost of goods sold  its selling  general and administrative expenses increased while its revenues significantly decreased  contributing to the loss 
diluted earnings per share decreased to a loss of in the year ended december  from a profit of 
in the year ended december  the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and equivalents used in computing eps was million in and million in years ended december  and revenues 
the company had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this was an increase of million or 
revenues from the institutional security systems segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of 
the institutional security systems segment is largely a construction driven business 
much of its revenue is obtained by working on new and retrofit construction projects in the corrections industry  as opposed to sources of recurring revenue 
as such  the increase in revenue experienced by this segment is largely attributable to its ability to work on more projects than it did in the previous year 
one of the reasons it was able to do this was because its backlog had grown from million at december  to million at december  thus providing it with the ability to engage in more work in than it did in at december   the backlog for the institutional security system s segment declined to million 
the year was a slow bidding period for the company 
although the gross amount of construction spending in the corrections area remained relatively flat between and  the types of projects that the company solicits  namely large scale medium to maximum security installations  declined in this situation was further compounded by the general state and local governmental budget deficits which are causing these governmental units to rethink and delay many of their pending corrections projects 
revenues from the attack protection segment were flat at million during both and the attack protection segment was largely capacity constrained during as a result  the company purchased an existing  square foot factory on acres of land in close proximity to its existing factory in montgomery  alabama 
this expansion provided the segment with the necessary capacity to generate incremental revenue of approximately million per year 
this capacity increase was largely driven by the company s expectation that the demands for its products  principally its bullet and blast resistant windows and doors would accelerate significantly in the post september  world 
throughout and this anticipated increase in demand did not materialize leaving the segment with significant excess capacity 
this segment is composed of two chief product offerings  namely norshield  which encompasses the bullet and blast resistant windows and doors and ancillary products  and fiber sensys  which encompasses its fiber optic intrusion detection systems 
during the norshield line experienced a decline in revenues  whereas the fiber sensys line experienced a increase in revenue 
the company continues to see heightened interest for its fiber sensys products and expects sales for these items to continue to experience sustainable growth 
the slow down in the government building process experienced during and early has appeared to stabilize 
now it appears that projects are being released for construction  and thus the attack protection segment is experiencing increased bidding activity for its products 
during the fourth quarter of the company furnished bids to supply its products for eight new embassy projects 
this was the largest number of embassy projects bid in a single calendar year 
in addition  all indications are that this increased level of new embassy construction will continue for at least the next few years 
revenues from the federal security systems segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of 
a significant portion of this segment s revenue is backlog driven 
its backlog is therefore a precursor to future revenues 
the federal security systems segment s failure to have any meaningful backlog at december  resulted in substantially all of its revenue being driven by contract awards it received during this inherently caused the segment s revenue to be low during that period 
the federal security systems segment ended with a significantly improved backlog level of million 
as such it entered with a much greater book of business from which to generate its increased revenue during backlog at december  was million 
revenues from the public safety and justice segment increased million from million during to million in on may  the company completed its acquisition of tiburon  inc previously  the company controlled approximately of tiburon and recorded its investment in tiburon under the equity method of accounting 
subsequent to may   tiburon became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company at which time its operating results were consolidated with those of the company 
tiburon s revenues for amounted to million as compared to million for the eight month period tiburon was owned by compudyne in expenses 
cost of goods sold increased from million during to million in this increase was largely a result of the acquisition of tiburon on may   which added million of cost of goods sold to the results of the company  as well as increased costs of goods sold of million at the institutional security systems segment  all largely attributable to the increased sales levels attained by these segments 
the smaller percentage increase in cost of goods sold as compared to the percentage increase in sales resulted in an increased gross profit percentage of in as compared to in cost of goods sold in the institutional security systems segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million or 
this increase was less than the related sales increase of this segment of resulting in an increase in the gross profit percentage from in to in during  the west coast operations of the institutional security systems segment experienced significant cost overruns on many of its projects 
these cost overruns were incurred and recorded during the third and fourth quarters of and amounted to approximately million 
as a result  as these projects were brought to completion in  the revenues generated by them resulted in little margin or in some cases losses 
the company recorded approximately million of additional write downs on west coast projects that were either completed or neared completion in these were the primary reasons for the depressed gross profit percentage by institutional security systems 
to address this situation  in the company implemented more centralized controls and replaced certain personnel at its west coast operations 
cost of goods sold in the attack protection segment decreased from million in to million in this was a decrease of million or 
this decrease was smaller than the related sales increase of this segment of  resulting in an increase in the gross profit percentage from in to in although the results of this segment improved in  they are still significantly below what is expected of this segment 
we are actively working to better utilize the new capacity provided by the company in one of the actions we have taken was to relocate the airteq manufacturing operation in oregon and consolidate it into the facilities we have in montgomery  alabama 
this was done in an effort to enhance the utilization of our owned facilities in alabama and thus use some of our excess manufacturing capacity 
although not a huge contributor  this did in fact result in further utilization of approximately  square feet of previously unused manufacturing space in our new plant in alabama 
cost of goods sold in the federal security systems segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million or 
this increase was slightly less than the related sales increase for this segment of 
the federal security systems segment gross profit percentage was and in and respectively 
substantially all of the projects awarded in this segment are discrete projects 
cost of goods sold in the public safety and justice segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million 
substantially all of this increase was a result of the company s may  acquisition of tiburon 
in addition  in the company recognized approximately million of revenue related to hardware supplied under a contract with one of its clients 
this hardware was furnished at minimal gross profit of approximately  which caused the entire margin for this segment to be reduced 
this segment recorded a million charge for a contract in litigation 
this charge was recorded by reducing previously recorded revenues by approximately thousand and increasing cost of goods sold by million 
operating expenses increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million 
much of the change in operating expenses was a result of the company s may  acquisition of tiburon 
included in operating expenses in is thousand related to the closure and relocation of its iss midwest regional office and its airteq manufacturing group 
in conjunction with the acquisition on may   of tiburon  inc and in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no

amount life in thousands in years trade name  indefinite customer relationships  software  backlog other the amortization of the above intangibles resulted in the company recording amortization expense related to these intangibles of thousand and thousand in and  respectively  which is included in operating expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in being a technology driven enterprise  the company s public safety and justice segment is required to continually update and enhance its software offerings thus causing it to incur significant research and development costs 
the increase in over is largely a reflection of the may acquisition of tiburon by the company 
interest expense remained relatively constant at million in both and monthly weighted monthly weighted average average amount rate amount rate in thousands in thousands bank borrowings   industrial revenue bonds  subordinated borrowings  in addition the company recorded the following non cash interest expense amortization and write off of financing charges taxes on income 
the effective tax rate in was as compared to in the primary reason for this change in effective tax rates is due to a change in the mix in the states in which the company s earnings occurred 
net income 
the company reported net income of million and million in and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share increased to 
in from 
in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and equivalents increased from million in to million liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operations through cash flows generated from its operations  bank and public financings  and the sale of its common stock 
the company s liquidity requirements arise from cash necessary to carry its inventories and billed and unbilled receivables  for capital expenditures  to repurchase shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program  for payments of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and for acquisitions 
the ultimate clients of the company are primarily federal  state and local governmental units 
in the event the funding of these governmental units is reduced for any reason  including budgetary reductions due to economic conditions  there is a risk that the demand for the company s goods and services would decrease which would reduce the availability of funds to the company 
as of december   the company had working capital of million compared with million as of december  the most significant changes in working capital were due to the receipt of the proceeds from the notes financing  offset in part by the concurrent pay down of the company s debt  with the balance invested in available for sale marketable securities and current acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  versus million provided by operating activities in the year ended december  the largest component of cash provided by operating activities was a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
this decrease was largely caused by the decline in revenues experienced by the company 
net cash used for investing activities was million in the year ended december  compared to net cash used of million in the year ended december  in the year ended december   the net of marketable securities bought and redeemed was million 
in addition million of cash was used to fund our two acquisitions and million of cash was used to purchase property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in the year ended december  compared with a net cash use of million in the year ended december  this amount was primarily provided through the issuance of the notes offset by the repayment of million of our bank borrowings 
the following table summarizes the contractual obligations of the company as of december  and the payments due by period  in thousands 
long term debt operating leases interest on contractual obligations december thereafter   totals    in addition  the company enters into purchase obligations to procure equipment and services  including subcontractor contracts  in the performance of the day to day operations of its business 
substantially all of these obligations are covered by our existing backlog and the revenues generated by these backlogs are expected to be sufficient to meet any payment obligations resulting from these purchase commitments 
on january   the company completed the offering of the notes 
the offering was for million principal amount plus an underwriter s over allotment option of million principal amount  which was exercised in full 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually  and are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the proceeds from the notes were used to repay substantially all of the company s outstanding borrowings 
during january  the company repaid substantially all of its outstanding bank borrowings from the proceeds of the issuance of its notes 
the company has decided not to repay any of its industrial revenue bond irb borrowings as it has determined that there are certain favorable tax treatments afforded the company when it entered into these irb s  which it would lose in the event these borrowings were repaid prematurely 
on march  the company and its banks amended and restated its credit agreement 
under the terms of the new agreement million of the line of credit matures on march  and million of the line of credit matured on march  on october  and march   the company and its banks entered into amendments to the credit agreement pursuant to which the banks waived the company s non compliance with its fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of september  and non compliance with its minimum ebitda covenant as of december   respectively 
in addition  the company and its banks amended the credit agreement to eliminate the million line of credit maturing march and to require borrowings under its million line of credit to be collateralized by pledged marketable securities equal to of the value of such borrowings 
the credit agreement was also amended to eliminate the quarterly minimum ebitda covenant for the company s fiscal years ending after december  and to provide that the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  maximum debt to ebitda ratio covenant and the minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant will not become effective until march  so long as the company maintains pledged marketable securities equal to of the value of its borrowings under the credit agreement  borrowings under the credit agreement shall bear interest at libor or prime 
the company incurs commitment fees equal to a range of to on any unused balances  defined as the difference between the total amount of its million line of credit less amounts borrowed  and outstanding under letters of credit 
the company s total outstanding borrowings at december  amounted to approximately million  net of the broker s discounts 
the notes accounted for million  net of the broker s discounts  of these borrowings 
the remaining amount of million resulted from borrowings at variable rates and consisted of two industrial revenue bonds outstanding in the amounts of million and million 
the interest rate charged to the company at december  for its industrial revenue bonds was 
the variable interest rate for these borrowings fluctuated between and during the year ended december  based on weekly market conditions 
these bonds are fully collateralized by bank letters of credit issued under the credit agreement 
the company s banks consider letters of credit as outstanding borrowings when considering the amount of availability the company has remaining under its line of credit and in determining the amount of marketable securities needed to be pledged as collateral 
other than the company s letters of credit  which amounted to million at december   the company has no other material off balance sheet liabilities 
at december  the company had million of unused availability  subject to the pledge of collateral under its line of credit 
as a result of the variable nature of the interest rate on the company s bank borrowings  any increase in the amount of outstanding borrowings and or decreases in the company s ebitda an increase in the leverage ratio will result in the company s interest rate increasing and thus the amount of interest expense incurred also increasing 
the company anticipates that cash generated from operations and borrowings under the working capital line of credit and the cash generated from its recent issuance of the notes will enable the company to meet its liquidity  working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the next months and beyond 
the company  however  may require additional financing to pursue its strategy of growth through acquisitions  and to meet its long term liquidity  working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
if such financing is required  there are no assurances that it will be available  or if available  that it can be obtained on terms favorable to the company 
from time to time  the company may be party to one or more non binding letters of intent regarding material acquisitions  which  if consummated  may be paid for with cash or through the issuance of a significant number of shares of the company s common stock 
the interest rate environment earlier this year was at historic lows 
in light of this favorable environment  the company determined that it was in its best interests to lock in a favorable fixed interest rate for a significant amount of borrowings 
these borrowings  which were made on a subordinated basis  were used to pay off the company s existing bank debt and will be available to fund the company s future growth opportunities and also will be available to fund any acquisitions the company may wish to pursue 
these funds will be instrumental in the company s growth through acquisition strategy 
unlike the company s existing bank debt availability  the notes do not contain any restrictive covenants or ratios 
as a result of securing this borrowing  the company renegotiated its bank lines of credit 
although the company currently does not see the need to borrow under its bank line  it intends to keep this line available at least to provide the required collateral for its industrial revenue bond borrowings 
additional considerations cost containment due to current economic conditions  and in light of a very strong competitive environment  the company recognizes that its ability to increase the prices it charges its clients is limited 
as a result  in order to enhance its profitability  the company will continue to seek ways to reduce its costs 
pension plan prior to the company maintained a money purchase pension plan  which covered employees at one of its divisions 
all employees at this division were eligible to participate in this plan after one year of service 
annual contributions of between and of annual compensation were made by the company depending on the employees years of service 
the expense related to funding the plan was thousand during effective december   the company ceased contributions to this plan 
the participants in this plan were vested 
the plan was then terminated and the participants were given three distribution options a rollover to their k plan  a cash distribution  or an annuity purchase 
total backlog compudyne s total backlog amounted to million at december  this was a decrease of from the company s december  backlog of million 
the break down of the company s backlog by segment is as follows  in thousands december  december  institutional security systems   attack protection   federal security systems   public safety and justice   totals   included in the backlog of the public safety and justice segment at december  and december  is million and million  respectively  representing awards received by the segment  for which the clients have not yet entered into signed contracts 
these awards are expected to result in signed contracts over the next twelve months 
corporate reorganization as part of the company s efforts to better manage its costs  during the first quarter of the company implemented a corporate reorganization whereby it dissolved an inactive subsidiary and converted several corporate entities into llcs limited liability corporations 
this activity was designed to improve the company s tax reporting structure and should help better manage the company s state income tax obligations 
in conjunction with this reorganization  our federal security systems group  formerly known as quanta systems  was renamed compudyne integrated electronics  and our public safety and justice group  formerly known as tiburon  was renamed compudyne public safety and justice  inc the impact of this reorganization is not expected to have a material effect on operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates percentage of completion accounting and revenue recognition 
approximately of the company s revenues are derived from long term contracts where revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company s software related contracts utilize labor hours incurred to date on a project  divided by the total expected project hours to determine the completion percentage 
the company s construction contracts utilize costs incurred to date on a project  divided by the total expected project costs to determine the completion percentage 
both of these methods require considerable judgment and  as such  the estimates derived at any point in time could differ significantly from actual results 
these estimates affect many of the balance sheet and statement of operations accounts including net sales  cost of goods sold  accounts receivable  contract costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of contract costs incurred 
revenues for support and maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
sales of products unrelated to contract revenue are recognized as revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period such losses are determined 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out fifo method 
costs included in inventories consist of materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead  which are related to the purchase and production of inventories 
warranty reserves are estimated and made at the time products are sold or services are rendered 
they are established using historical information on the nature  frequency and average cost of warrant claims 
the company warrants numerous products  the terms of which vary widely 
in general  the company warrants its products against defect and specific non performance 
accounts receivable are expected to be substantially collected within one year except for a portion of the receivables recorded as retainage 
retainage expected to be collected in over one year is reflected as a current asset as it will be collected within the operating cycle under the related contract 
tax valuation allowances are established when the company believes it is not more likely than not that the company will be able to receive tax benefits in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets 
the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization annually during the fourth quarter of the year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
changes in estimates of future cash flows caused by items such as unforeseen events or changes in market conditions could negatively affect the company s reporting units fair value and result in an impairment charge 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization which totaled approximately million and intangible assets subject to amortization which totaled approximately million  net  at december  stock compensation policy 
the company accounts for its stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method and in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
economic conditions and the after effect of the september  terrorist attacks much of the work compudyne performs is for state and local governmental units 
these entities have been severely impacted by recent economic conditions and the resulting contraction of the tax bases of these governmental units 
this has caused these governmental units to carefully evaluate their budgets and defer expenses and projects where possible 
much of the work of the company s public safety and justice  and institutional security systems segments is contracted with these state and local governmental units 
as a result  these segments have seen delays in new work available to be bid and worked on 
in addition  even work that has been contracted for where possible is being deferred by the customer into the future  presumably when the tax bases will be more robust 
after the occurrence of the tragic events of the september  terrorist attacks  there was a general perception that our federal security systems and attack protection segments would see a significant increase in order flow 
to the contrary  in the months subsequent to the terrorist attacks these segments saw a slowing in new work opportunities as the various federal agencies and other customers that are the usual source of business for the company slowed their procurement processes waiting for definitive direction as to how to proceed in the post september world 
now further complicated by the military action in iraq  the company s clients are reevaluating priorities and budgets and are funding only their most pressing demands while also making key decisions as to which projects can be deferred 
as a result of the above factors  during the last three years the company has experienced a more challenging marketplace than it experienced in several years prior to september  impact of inflation inflation did not have a significant effect on compudyne s operations during market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on june  in the initial notional amount of million 
the notional amount of this swap agreement declines by thousand on a quarterly basis until it becomes on october  at december  the notional amount of the swap agreement had declined to million at a fixed rate of 
in january the interest rate swap ceased to be a highly effective cash flow hedge when the related debt was repaid 
consequently  the amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income as changes in fair value of the interest rate swap were recognized in earnings for the year ended december  upon determination of the hedge ineffectiveness  the cumulative loss on the fair value of the interest rate swap was thousand  which was recognized in other income 
the change in fair value of the interest rate swap for the year ended december  was a gain of thousand  resulting in a remaining liability for the investment of thousand 
future changes in the value of the interest rate swap will be recognized in earnings 
on january   the company completed an offering of million principal amount of the notes 
the offering was for million principal amount plus an underwriter s over allotment option of million principal amount  which was exercised in full 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually  and are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company used a portion of the proceeds of this note offering to pay down outstanding borrowings under its variable rate bank notes 
subsequent to the pay down of its bank notes the only variable rate borrowings outstanding was approximately million of industrial revenue bonds 
since these borrowings bear interest at variable rates  and in the event interest rates increase dramatically  the increase in interest expense to the company could be material to the results of operations of the company
