in particular  tsfg presents operating noninterest income as a percentage of operating total revenue  operating efficiency ratio  and certain designated net interest income amounts on a tax equivalent basis in accordance with common industry practice 
management uses operating measures in the calculation of certain of tsfg s ratios to analyze on a consistent basis and over a longer period of time the performance of which it considers to be its core banking operations 
management believes that the presentation of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis aids in the comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources 
tsfg also presents loan and deposit growth  excluding loans deposits acquired net of dispositions organic 
these disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap measures  and furthermore  tsfg s non gaap measures may not necessarily be comparable to non gaap performance measures of other companies

lauderdale  ocala  and west palm beach 
approximately of tsfg s total asset growth has come through acquisitions 
tsfg will continue to consider acquisitions that meet its acquisition criteria of strategic franchise enhancement  accretion to cash operating earnings per share within months  and consistency with tsfg s three year performance goals 
in october  tsfg announced a definitive agreement to acquire pointe financial corporation pointe  a bank holding company headquartered in boca raton  florida  which had approximately million in assets at december  this acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of tsfg has pursued a strategy of growth through internal expansion and the acquisition of financial institutions and branch locations in selected market areas 
tsfg seeks to expand selectively in fast growing markets in the southeast  concentrating its growth in metropolitan statistical areas msas 
tsfg believes this market strength enhances tsfg s opportunities to grow loans and deposits and provide noninterest income products and services 
tsfg ranks fourth in total deposit share in south carolina 
in florida  tsfg ranks among the top ten banks in tampa bay  orlando  and jacksonville in terms of deposit market share 
after tsfg s pending merger with pointe is completed  tsfg expects to rank fourteenth in total deposit share in the entire state of florida 
following the merger  approximately of tsfg s total deposits will be in florida

net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on assets  primarily loans and securities  and the interest paid for liabilities to support such assets  primarily deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income for increased over  principally due to strong organic loan growth which improved the earning asset mix  growth from acquisitions  and a seven basis point increase in the net interest margin

average deposit transaction account balances as a percentage of average total deposits increased to for from for for  organic transaction deposit growth  which excludes the net acquired transaction deposits  totaled 
tsfg s tangible equity to tangible asset ratio decreased to at december  from at december   primarily due to an increase in the net unrealized loss on available for sale securities 
critical accounting policies and estimates tsfg s accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practice within the banking industry 
tsfg makes a number of estimates and assumptions relating to reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during periods presented 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  fair value of certain financial instruments securities  derivatives  and privately held investments  income tax assets or liabilities  and accounting for acquisitions 
to a lesser extent  significant estimates are also associated with the determination of contingent liabilities and stock based compensation 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in tsfg s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses allowance represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the lending portfolio 
see balance sheet review allowance for loan losses for additional discussion  including the methodology for analyzing the adequacy of the allowance 
this methodology relies upon management s judgment in segregating the portfolio into risk similar segments  computing specific allocations for impaired loans  and setting the amounts within the probable loss range from to of the adjusted historical loss ratio 
management s judgments evolve from an assessment of various issues  including but not limited to the pace of loan growth  emerging portfolio concentrations  risk management system  entry into new markets  new product offerings  loan portfolio quality trends  and uncertainty in current economic and business conditions 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment 
management considers the year end allowance appropriate and adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio 
however  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about current events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting the operating results of tsfg 
the allowance is also subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions  and other adequacy tests 
in addition  such regulatory agencies could require tsfg to adjust its allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
fair value of certain financial instruments fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be liquidated in a transaction between willing  unrelated parties in a normal business transaction 
fair value is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments  adjusted for any differences in terms 
if market values are not readily available  then the fair value is estimated 
for example  when tsfg has an investment in a privately held company  tsfg s management evaluates the fair value of these investments based on the investee s ability to generate cash through its operations  obtain alternative financing  and subjective factors 
modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses  which use assumptions for interest rates  credit losses  prepayments  and discount rates  are also used to estimate fair value if market values are not readily available for certain financial instruments 
tsfg carries its securities available for sale and derivatives classified as cash flow hedges at fair value 
adjustments for unrealized gains or losses  net of the income tax effect  are made to accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
instruments held for trading  including trading securities and derivative financial instruments used in trading activities  are carried at fair value  and adjustments for realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in earnings 
derivatives classified as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value 
the changes in the fair value along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedge risk are included in earnings 
tsfg evaluates declines in the market value below cost of any available for sale or held to maturity security for other than temporary impairment periodically and  if necessary  charges the unrealized loss to operations and establishes a new cost basis 
evidence in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to period end  and forecasted performance of the investee 
impairment is considered other than temporary unless the holder of the security has both the intent and ability to hold the security until the fair value recovers and evidence supporting the recovery outweighs evidence to the contrary 
however  for equity securities  which typically do not have a contractual maturity with a specified cash flow on which to rely  the ability to hold an equity security indefinitely  by itself  does not allow for avoidance of other than temporary impairment 
all of tsfg s investments in limited partnerships and llcs are privately held  and their market values are not readily available 
these investments are accounted for using either the cost or the equity method of accounting 
the accounting treatment depends upon tsfg s percentage ownership and degree of management influence 
tsfg s management evaluates its investments in limited partnerships and llcs for impairment based on the investee s ability to generate cash through its operations  obtain alternative financing  and subjective factors 
there are inherent risks associated with tsfg s investments in limited partnerships and llcs  which may result in income statement volatility in future periods 
the process for valuing financial instruments  particularly those with little or no liquidity  is subjective and involves a high degree of judgment 
small changes in assumptions can result in significant changes in valuation 
valuations are subject to change as a result of external factors beyond our control that have a substantial degree of uncertainty 
the inherent risks associated with determining the fair value of a financial instrument may result in income statement volatility in future periods 
income taxes management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable for the current year  deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently in its financial statements and income tax returns  and income tax expense 
determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations 
management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments and estimates are re evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
no assurance can be given that either the tax returns submitted by management or the income tax reported on the consolidated financial statements will not be adjusted by either adverse rulings by the us tax court  changes in the tax code  or assessments made by the internal revenue service 
tsfg is subject to potential adverse adjustments  including but not limited to an increase in the statutory federal or state income tax rates  the permanent nondeductibility of amounts currently considered deductible either now or in future periods  and the dependency on the generation of future taxable income  including capital gains  in order to ultimately realize deferred income tax assets 
historically  tsfg s estimated income taxes reported on its consolidated financial statements have been materially correct and we do not believe that it is reasonably likely that such estimates assumptions will change in the future  however  such changes are difficult to predict 
during the third quarter  the internal revenue service completed its examination of tsfg s through federal income tax returns 
tsfg did not receive any adverse rulings or additional tax assessments as a result of these examinations 
accounting for acquisitions tsfg has grown its operations  in part  through bank and non bank acquisitions 
since  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  tsfg has used the purchase method of accounting to account for acquisitions 
under this method  tsfg is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party  internal  or other valuation techniques 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals for planned facilities dispositions and employee benefit related considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill or other intangible assets  which are subject to periodic impairment tests  on an annual basis  or more often  if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
these tests  which tsfg performed as of june    and  use estimates such as projected cash flows  discount rates  time periods  and comparable market values in their calculations 
furthermore  the determination of which intangible assets have finite lives is subjective  as well as the determination of the amortization period for such intangible assets 
tsfg tests for goodwill impairment by determining the fair value for each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the potential for impairment exists  and a second step of impairment testing is required 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
if the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill is lower than its carrying amount  goodwill is impaired and is written down to its fair value 
the valuations as of june  indicated that no impairment charge was required as of that test date 
there have been no events or circumstances since june  that indicate there may be impairment 
historically  tsfg s acquisition intangibles reported on its consolidated financial statements have been materially correct and we do not believe that it is reasonably likely that such estimates assumptions will change in the future  however  such changes are difficult to predict 
tsfg s other intangible assets have an estimated finite useful life and are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset 
tsfg periodically reviews its other intangible assets to determine whether there have been any events or circumstances to indicate the recorded amount is not recoverable from projected undiscounted cash flows 
if the projected undiscounted net operating cash flows are less than the carrying amount  a loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to fair value  and when appropriate  the amortization period is also reduced
