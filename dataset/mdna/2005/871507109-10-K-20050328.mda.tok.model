item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please read risk factors 
our actual results may differ materially from those estimated or projected in any of these forward looking statements 
executive overview our company we own and operate a network of surgery centers in states 
as of march   we owned and operated surgery centers and managed nine additional surgery centers 
we own a majority interest in of the surgery centers in which we own an interest  and consolidate of these centers for financial reporting purposes 
our surgery centers include three facilities that are licensed as hospitals  two of which we own and one of which we manage 
in addition to our surgery centers  we also operate two diagnostic centers and manage three physician networks  including two physician networks in markets in which we operate surgery centers 
we anticipate acquiring about three to four centers and developing three to four centers annually during the next three to five years 
a typical surgery center costs us between million and million to develop and equip  excluding costs of real estate 
this cost varies depending on the range of specialties that will be provided at the facility and the number of operating and treatment rooms 
we typically fund about of the development costs of a new surgery center with borrowings under our senior credit facility  and the remainder with equity contributed by us and the other owners of the center 
our ownership interests in surgery centers that we have developed range from to  although we anticipate that we will own primarily majority interests in future developments 
the remaining owners are typically local physicians  physician groups or hospitals 
we expect that our acquisition and development program will require substantial capital resources  which we estimate to range from million to million per year over the next three years 
in addition  the operations of our existing facilities will require ongoing capital expenditures 
we expect that our capital needs will be financed through a combination of cash flow from operations  bank debt and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
we generate revenue and cash through patient service revenues  physician service revenues and other service revenues 
patient service revenues are revenues for surgical or diagnostic procedures performed in each of the surgery centers that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes 
the fee charged for a procedure varies depending on the procedure  but usually includes all charges for usage of an operating room  a recovery room  special equipment  supplies  nursing staff and medications 
the fee does not include professional fees charged by the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physician  which are billed directly by such physicians to the patient or third party payor 
patient service revenues are recognized on the date of service  net of estimated contractual adjustments and discounts for third party payors  including medicare and medicaid 
changes in estimated contractual adjustments and discounts are recorded in the period of change 
physician service revenues are revenues from physician networks consisting of reimbursed expenses  plus participation in the excess of revenue over expenses of the physician networks  as provided for in our service agreements with our physician networks 
reimbursed expenses include the costs of personnel  supplies and other expenses incurred to provide the management services to the physician networks 
we recognize physician service revenues in the period in which reimbursable expenses are incurred and in the period in which we have the right to receive a percentage of the amount by which a physician network s revenues exceed its expenses 
physician service revenues are based on net billings with any changes in estimated contractual adjustments reflected in service revenues in the subsequent period 
other service revenues consists of management and administrative service fees derived from the non consolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method  management of surgery centers in which we do not own an interest and management services we provide to physician networks for which we are not required to provide capital or additional assets 

table of contents the following table summarizes our revenues by service type as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  patient service revenues physician service revenues other service revenues total competition in developing or acquiring existing surgery centers  we compete with other public and private surgery center and hospital companies 
several large national companies own and or manage surgery centers and surgical hospitals  including healthsouth corporation  hca inc  universal health services  inc  amsurg corp 
and united surgical partners international  inc many of these companies have greater resources and access to capital than we do 
in addition  local hospitals  physician groups and other providers may compete with us in the ownership and operation of surgery centers 
the number of physicians that perform outpatient surgeries in an office based setting is expected to rise in the upcoming years 
operating trends we intend to increase revenues by increasing the number of cases performed at each surgery center 
we also intend to increase revenues by acquiring additional surgery centers and developing new surgery centers 
as a result of the increased revenues  we expect our ebitda margin to increase due to operating efficiencies and economies of scale as a result of leveraged general and administrative expenses 
our success in the future will be determined by the continued success of our current surgery centers as well as our ability to acquire and incorporate new facilities 
acquisitions  developments and divestitures acquisitions and developments during  we acquired six centers  developed three additional surgery centers  opened one imaging center and entered into a management agreement for one additional surgery center 
we entered into management agreements with each of these centers 
one of our newly developed surgery centers was developed through a partnership with one of our existing physician networks 
our investment related to these centers was about million 
we paid for these investments using cash from operations and funds available under our senior secured credit facility 
during  we acquired five centers  including one licensed as a hospital  opened five newly developed surgery centers and assumed a management agreement for one additional surgery center licensed as a hospital 
we entered into management agreements with each of these surgery centers and have a majority ownership interest in four of these centers 
our investment related to these centers was about million 
we paid for these investments using primarily funds available under our senior credit facility 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in addition  during  we acquired an additional ownership interest in dry creek imaging center  a diagnostic imaging center that is adjacent to our surgery center in the denver  colorado market  for about million in cash 
we now own of the center 
we also acquired an additional ownership interest in village surgicenter in erie  pennsylvania  for about million in cash 
we now own an interest in the center 
in april  we acquired physicians surgical care  inc  which had ownership interests in and managed seven surgery centers  including one licensed as a hospital 
a subsidiary of physicians surgical care assisted in the development of an additional surgery center to which we began providing administrative services when it opened in 
table of contents october in connection with the acquisition  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock   shares of our series a convertible preferred stock and  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock 
in addition  during  we issued an additional  shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of physicians surgical care based on the financial results of one of the physicians surgical care surgery centers 
in addition to physicians surgical care  we acquired ownership interests in three additional surgery centers and opened two newly developed surgery centers during we entered into management agreements with each of these surgery centers and have majority ownership interests in four of the centers 
our total investment related to these centers was about million  including about million funded with debt 
divestitures during  after purchasing the outstanding ownership interests from our prior physician and hospital partners  we restructured our physicians surgicenter of houston partnership in houston  texas  creating a joint venture with the american institute of gastric banding  ltd 
a privately held single procedure focused surgical company based in dallas  texas aigb 
in connection with the restructuring  we retained a ownership in the surgery center and we no longer manage or consolidate the surgery center for financial reporting purposes 
subsequent to december   we entered into discussions with aigb relating to the possible disposition of our ownership in the surgery center 
effective may   the surgery center we managed in knoxville  tennessee closed following the opening of the new surgery center in this market we developed with the same organization  university health system  inc we have a ownership interest in the new surgery center 
effective september   we sold all of our ownership interest in a surgery center and terminated our management agreement with the surgery center 
in consideration for our ownership interest and termination of the management agreement  we received about million in cash in october in addition  we were released from a guaranty of about million of debt incurred by the center 
we recorded a charge in of about  in connection with this transaction 
effective may   we sold all of our ownership interest in a surgery center and terminated our management agreement with the surgery center 
in consideration for our ownership interest  we were released from a guaranty of the facility lease for the surgery center and the purchaser assumed about million of liabilities 
we recorded a net loss in of about  in connection with this transaction 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from our current judgments and estimates 
our actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require our management s subjective or complex judgment because of the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates used 
this listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment regarding accounting policy 
consolidation and control our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries  as well as our interests in facilities that we control through our ownership of a majority voting interest or other rights granted to us by contract as the sole general partner or manager to manage and control the business 
the rights of the 
table of contents limited partners or minority members in these surgery centers are generally limited to those that protect their ownership interests  including the right to approve of the issuance of new ownership interests  and those that protect their financial interests  including the right to approve the acquisition or divestiture of significant assets or the incurrence of debt that physician limited partners or members are required to guarantee on a pro rata basis based upon their respective ownership interests or that exceeds of the fair market value of the center s assets 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions  including management fees from consolidated centers  are eliminated in consolidation 
we also hold non controlling interests in some surgery centers over which we exercise significant influence 
significant influence includes financial interests ranging from to and duties  rights and responsibilities for the day to day management of the surgery center 
these non controlling interests are accounted for under the equity method 
in addition  on december   as a result of interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities vies  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin  we consolidated for financial reporting purposes a surgery center in which we do not own an interest 
under fin  the surgery center is considered a vie and we are the primary beneficiary 
therefore  under fin we are required to consolidate this surgery center for financial reporting purposes 
we currently do not expect the consolidation of this surgery center to have a material impact on our results of operations 
revenue recognition our revenues are comprised of patient service revenues  physician service revenues and other service revenues 
our patient service revenues relate to fees charged for surgical or diagnostic procedures performed at facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes 
these fees are billed either to the patient or a third party payor 
our fees vary depending on the procedure  but usually include all charges for usage of an operating room  a recovery room  equipment  supplies  nursing staff and medications 
our fees do not include professional fees charged by the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physician  which are billed directly by the physicians to the patient or third party payor 
we recognize patient service revenues when the related procedures are performed 
our physician service revenues relate to fees we derive from managing physician networks for which we also have a contractual obligation to provide capital and additional assets 
currently we have such an obligation to only one group of six physicians included in one of the three physician networks we manage 
we expect our physician service revenues to decline as a percentage of our total revenues as we continue to focus on our surgery center business 
physician service revenues consist of reimbursed expenses and a percentage of the amount by which each physician network s revenues exceed its expenses  as defined by our management agreement with each physician network 
we recognize physician service revenues in the period in which reimbursable expenses are incurred and the period in which we have rights to a percentage of the amount by which a physician network s revenues exceed its expenses 
our other service revenues are comprised of management and administrative service fees we derive from non consolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method  management of surgery centers in which we do not own an interest and management services we provide to physician networks for which we are not required to provide capital or additional assets 
the fees we derive from these management arrangements are based on a pre determined percentage of the revenues of each surgery center and physician network 
we recognize other service revenues in the period in which services are rendered 
allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts our patient service revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual allowances from third party payors  which we estimate based on the historical trend of our surgery centers cash collections and contractual write offs  accounts receivable agings  established fee schedules  relationships with payors and procedure statistics 
we estimate our allowances for bad debts using similar information and analysis 
while we believe that our allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debts are adequate  if the actual write offs are significantly different from our estimates  our results of operations may  in turn  be significantly impacted 
our net accounts receivable reflected allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents we derive all of our physician service revenues from physician networks with which we have service agreements 
physician service revenues from physician networks consist of reimbursable expenses plus participation in the excess of revenue over expenses of the physician networks as provided for in the service agreements 
reimbursed expenses include the costs of our personnel  supplies and other expenses incurred to provide the management services to the physician networks 
we recognize physician service revenues in the period in which reimbursable expenses are incurred and in the period in which we have rights to a percentage of the amount by which a physician network s revenues exceed its expenses 
the participation component of physician service revenues is based on net billings of the physician network 
changes in estimated contractual adjustments and bad debts are reflected in physician service revenues in subsequent periods 
our physician service revenues would be impacted by changes in estimated contractual adjustments and bad debts recorded by the physician networks 
the following table summarizes our day s sales outstanding as of the dates indicated as of december  day s sales outstanding our target for day s sales outstanding related to patient service revenues ranges from days to days 
our day s sales outstanding for the dates presented in the table above are within the target range 
our collection policies and procedures are based on the type of payor  size of claim and estimated collection percentage for each patient account 
the operating systems used to manage our patient accounts provide for an aging schedule in day increments  by payor  physician and patient 
the operating systems generate reports that assist in the collection efforts by prioritizing patient accounts 
collection efforts include direct contact with insurance carriers or patients  written correspondence and the use of legal or collection agency assistance  as required 
we review the standard aging schedule  by facility  to determine the appropriate provision for doubtful accounts 
this review is supported by an analysis of the actual net revenues  contractual adjustments and cash collections received 
if our internal collection efforts are unsuccessful  we manually review patient accounts with balances of or more 
we then classify the accounts based on any external collection efforts we deem appropriate 
an account is written off only after we have pursued collection with legal or collection agency assistance or otherwise deemed an account to be uncollectible 
typically  accounts will be outstanding a minimum of days before being written off 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if a net operating loss carryforward exists  we make a determination as to whether that net operating loss carryforward will be utilized in the future 
a valuation allowance will be established for certain net operating loss carry forwards where their recoverability is deemed to be uncertain 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we will be required to adjust our deferred tax valuation allowances 
long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets when events  circumstances or operating results indicate that the carrying values of certain long lived assets and the related identifiable intangible assets might be impaired  we assess whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the assessment indicates that the recorded cost will not be recoverable  that cost will be reduced to estimated fair value 
estimated fair value will be determined based on a discounted future cash flow analysis 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of  primarily related to the write down of 
table of contents obsolete medical equipment 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to software that we purchased but no longer intended to use 
we believe that there has been no other impairment 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value method 
impairment is measured at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flows model to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
we will perform a goodwill impairment test between annual impairment tests whenever events or changes in facts or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist  or at least annually during the fourth quarter each year 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment test and there was no indication of impairment 
professional liability insurance claims we are subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business  including claims relating to patient treatment  employment practices and personal injuries 
to cover these claims  we maintain general and professional liability insurance in excess of self insured retentions through a third party commercial insurance carrier in amounts we believe to be sufficient for its operations 
we expense the costs under the self insured retention exposure for general and professional liability claims which relate to i deductibles on claims made during the policy period  and ii an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
reserves and provisions for professional liability are based upon actuarially determined estimates 
these balances for professional liability represent the estimated costs of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates 
the reserves are estimated using individual case basis valuations and actuarial analysis 
changes to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating results 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes certain statements of operations items for each of the three years ended december   and the table also shows the percentage relationship to total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  of of of amount revenues amount revenues amount revenues dollars in thousands revenues cost of revenues general and administrative expense depreciation and amortization provision for doubtful accounts income on equity investments impairment and loss on disposal of long lived assets gain on sale of long lived assets total operating expenses operating income minority interests in income loss of consolidated subsidiaries interest expense  net income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income adjusted net income adjusted net income is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles 
adjusted net income reflects an income tax rate of for the years ended december   and and excludes the non recurring prepayment charges incurred during and we believe that adjusted net income provides a better measurement of our ongoing performance and provides a more useful period to period comparison to investors because it excludes non recurring items not related to our core business operations 
adjusted net income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
our calculation of adjusted net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

liquidity and capital resources overview on february   we received net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  from our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which included  shares attributable to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
we used the net proceeds to repay indebtedness and to pay holders of series a and series b convertible preferred stock in connection with the conversion of those shares to common stock upon the completion of the offering 
during  we acquired six centers  opened three newly developed surgery centers  opened one imaging center and entered into a management agreement with one additional surgery center 
we entered into management agreements with each of these centers 
one of our newly developed surgery centers was developed through a partnership with one of our existing physician networks 
our investment related to these centers was about million 
we paid for these investments using cash from operations and funds available under our senior credit facility 
we have used capital during the past three years primarily to acquire and develop surgery centers 
our cash is used primarily to acquire centers  develop centers and pay operating expenses 
we anticipate acquiring about three to four centers and developing three to four centers annually during the next three to five years 
we expect that our acquisition and development program will require substantial capital resources  which we estimate to range from million to million per year over the next three years 
in addition  the operations of our existing facilities will require ongoing capital expenditures 
a typical surgery center costs us between million and million to develop and equip  excluding costs of real estate 
this cost varies depending on the range of specialties that will be 
table of contents provided at the facility and the number of operating and treatment rooms 
we typically fund about of the development costs of a new surgery center with borrowings under our senior credit facility and cash from operations  and the remainder with equity contributed by us and the other owners of the center 
in the past  our ownership interests in surgery centers that we have developed range from to  although we anticipate that we will own primarily majority interests in future developments 
we expect that our capital needs will be financed through a combination of cash flow from operations  bank debt and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
cash flow statement information during  we generated operating cash flow of million 
net cash used in investing activities during was million  including million of payments related to capital expenditures which consisted of payments for facilities acquired and developed and the acquisition of additional ownership interests in existing centers

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb no 
among other items  sfas no 
r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting allowed under apb no 
 and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the fair value of those awards on the grant date  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas no 
r is the first reporting period beginning after june   which is the third quarter of for calendar year companies 
early adoption of sfas no 
r is allowed 
sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted or modified after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permit entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
we have not yet determined which of the adoption methods we will use 
in connection with evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
r  we are also considering the potential implementation of different valuation models to determine the fair value of stock based compensation  although no decision has been made 
we currently determine the fair value of the stock options granted by using the black scholes option pricing model 
while sfas no 
r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we currently expect to adopt sfas no 
r effective july  we are currently evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 
r on our results of operations 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on several factors  including levels of options and awards granted in the future and when option or award holders exercise these awards 
risk factors the following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual financial condition  results of operations  business and prospects to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report or our other filings with the sec 
these risks and uncertainties are also factors that you should consider before investing in our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurred  our business  financial condition and operating results could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our business and industry we depend on payments from third party payors  including government health care programs and managed care organizations 
if these payments are reduced or eliminated  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon private and governmental third party sources of payment for the services provided to patients in our surgery centers and other facilities and the physician networks we manage 
the amount that our centers  facilities and networks receive in payment for their services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control  including medicare  medicaid and state regulations and the cost containment and utilization decisions and reduced reimbursement schedules of third party payors 
for the year ended december   payments from government payors represented about of our patient service revenues from surgery centers that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes 
medicare s system of paying for covered procedures performed in a surgery center or its rates for surgery center procedures may change in the near future 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  commonly referred to as the medicare modernization act  limits increases in medicare reimbursement rates 
table of contents for ambulatory surgery centers 
under the medicare modernization act  the increase in medicare reimbursement rates for ambulatory surgery centers that became effective october  is limited to an amount equal to the increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers as estimated by the secretary of the department of health and human services for the month period ended march   minus percentage points 
the medicare modernization act also provides that there will be no increase in these rates during the years through the medicare modernization act also directs the general accounting office to conduct a study comparing the cost of procedures in surgery centers to the cost of procedures performed in hospital outpatient departments 
the general accounting office was directed to submit the results of its study to the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  by no later than january  however  no report had been publicly released as of march  cms is directed to develop a new ambulatory surgery center payment system based upon the medicare hospital outpatient department payment system so that it is effective on or after january  and no later than january  the medicare modernization act provides that  in the year that the new payment system is implemented  it must be designed to result in the same aggregate amount of expenditures for surgical services provided at ambulatory surgery centers as would be made if the new system were not adopted 
the rate changes mandated by the medicare modernization act could have an adverse effect on the revenues of our centers  but we cannot predict at this time the full effect of the payment rate revisions 
previously  the department of health and human services proposed a rule which would increase the number of surgical procedure payment groups from eight to and the number of surgical procedures covered by the medicare program to about  all of the procedures paid at a particular rate would constitute a payment group 
each of the procedures would be paid at one of the prospectively determined payment rates 
to date  cms has not implemented the proposed surgery center methodology  and in light of the payment study mandated by the medicare modernization act  it is uncertain whether this proposed surgery center payment methodology will be implemented 
if implemented in its proposed form  the change in payment methodology could reduce our medicare revenues  depending on the volume and type of procedures performed at a particular facility 
states in which we perform medicaid procedures could also change their payment methodology in the future  and these changes may reduce the payments we receive for our services from state medicaid programs 
in addition  the medicare payment advisory commission  or medpac  and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services  or oig  have both recently recommended changes to the medicare payment methodology for surgery centers 
medpac is a congressional advisory board charged with advising congress on medicare payment issues  while the oig is a governmental agency responsible for investigating and monitoring medicare  medicaid and other department of health and human services programs 
generally  medpac and the oig have recommended that reimbursement levels for surgery center procedures be reduced 
these are recommendations only and it is uncertain if congress will act on either or both recommendations 
if these recommendations become effective  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
while most of our existing surgery center surgical procedures are generally reimbursed at levels lower than hospital outpatient departments  some of our existing surgical procedures are reimbursed at higher levels 
these proposed changes do not apply to our facilities licensed as hospitals 
if future government regulatory interpretations prohibit our centers from providing hour stay services  our revenues could decrease 
medicare regulations prohibit ambulatory surgery centers from performing surgical procedures on medicare patients if it is anticipated that the patient will require overnight recovery 
historically  however  cms has permitted ambulatory surgery centers to keep non medicare patients for up to hours 
on march   cms issued a memorandum to state survey agency directors stating that an ambulatory surgery center that routinely provides hour recovery services to non medicare patients will jeopardize the facility s medicare certification 
cms is expected to clarify or revise this new interpretation of the medicare ambulatory surgery center regulations 
if cms does not modify this interpretation  our centers would be unable to routinely offer services to patients requiring extended recovery time  and it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
if we are unable to negotiate contracts or maintain satisfactory relationships with private third party payors  our revenues and operating income will decrease 
payments from private third party payors represented about of our patient service revenues in managed care companies such as health maintenance organizations  or hmos  and preferred provider organizations  
table of contents or ppos  which offer prepaid and discounted medical service packages  represent a growing segment of private third party payors 
if we fail to enter into contracts and maintain satisfactory relationships with managed care organizations  our revenues may decrease 
cost containment measures  such as fixed fee schedules  capitation payment arrangements  reductions in reimbursement schedules by third party payors and closed provider networks  could also cause a reduction of our revenues in the future and cause our profit margins to decline 
payments from workers compensation payors represented approximately of our private third party payor patient service revenues in traditionally  workers compensation payors have paid surgery centers a percentage of the surgery centers charges 
several states have recently implemented workers compensation provider fee schedules  and other states have considered or have begun the process of developing a state workers compensation fee schedule for providers 
in some cases  the fee schedule rates contain lower rates than our surgery centers have historically been paid for the same services 
if the trend of states adopting lower workers compensation fee schedules continues  it could have a material adverse effect on our centers revenues 
our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to acquire and develop additional surgery centers on favorable terms 
if we are unable to do so  our future growth could be limited and our operating results could be adversely affected 
our strategy is to increase our revenues and earnings by continuing to focus on existing facilities and continuing to acquire and develop additional surgery centers 
since january  we have acquired or developed surgery centers  including three centers that we no longer own 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition and development opportunities and to negotiate and complete acquisitions and new projects on favorable terms 
in addition  our acquisition and development program requires substantial capital resources  and we may need to obtain additional capital or financing  from time to time  to fund these activities 
as a result  we may take actions that could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations or the price of our common stock  including incurring substantial debt or issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities that would dilute our existing stockholders ownership percentage 
sufficient capital or financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we may encounter numerous business risks in acquiring and developing additional surgery centers  and may have difficulty operating and integrating those surgery centers 
if we acquire or develop additional surgery centers  we may be unable to successfully operate the centers and we may experience difficulty in integrating their operations and personnel 
for example  in some acquisitions  we have experienced delays in implementing standard operating procedures and systems and improving existing managed care agreements and the mix of specialties offered at the centers 
following the acquisition of a surgery center  key physicians may cease to use the facility or we may be unable to retain key management personnel 
in some acquisitions  we may have to renegotiate  or risk losing  one or more of the surgery center s managed care contracts if the contracts are between the third party payor and the seller of the center rather than the center itself 
in addition  if we acquire the assets of a center rather than ownership interests in the entity that owns the center  we may be unable to assume the center s existing managed care contracts 
we may also be unable to collect the accounts receivable of an acquired center 
we may also experience negative effects on our reported results of operations because of acquisition related charges and potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
in addition  we may acquire surgery centers with unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations 
although we maintain professional and general liability insurance  we do not currently maintain insurance specifically covering any unknown or contingent liabilities that may have occurred prior to the acquisition of companies and surgery centers 
in some cases  our right to indemnification for these liabilities may be subject to negotiated limits 
in developing new surgery centers  we may be unable to attract physicians to use our facilities or contract with third party payors 
in addition  our newly developed surgery centers typically incur net losses during the initial periods of operation and  unless and until their case loads grow  they generally experience lower total revenues and operating margins than established surgery centers 
integrating a new surgery center could be expensive and time consuming  and could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management and other key personnel 
if we are unable to timely and efficiently integrate an acquired or newly developed center  our business could suffer 

table of contents efforts to regulate the construction  acquisition or expansion of health care facilities could prevent us from acquiring additional surgery centers or other facilities  renovating our existing facilities or expanding the breadth of services we offer 
some states require prior approval for the construction  acquisition or expansion of health care facilities or expansion of the services the facilities offer 
in giving approval  these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services 
in states in which we currently operate  certificates of need must be obtained for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in capacity or services offered and various other matters 
other states in which we now or may in the future operate may adopt similar legislation 
our costs of obtaining a certificate of need could be significant and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the certificates of need or other required approvals for additional or expanded facilities or services in the future 
in addition  at the time we acquire a facility  we may agree to replace or expand the acquired facility 
if we are unable to obtain required approvals  we may not be able to acquire additional surgery centers or other facilities  expand health care services we provide at these facilities or replace or expand acquired facilities 
if we fail to maintain good relationships with the physicians who use our facilities  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
our business depends upon the efforts and success of the physicians who provide medical services at our facilities and the strength of our relationships with these physicians 
these physicians are not employees of our facilities and are not contractually required to use our facilities 
we generally do not enter into contracts with physicians who use our facilities  other than partnership and operating agreements with physicians who own interests in our surgery centers  provider agreements with anesthesiology groups that provide anesthesiology services in our surgery centers  medical director agreements and pain clinic agreements 
physicians who use our facilities also use other facilities or hospitals and may choose to perform procedures in an office based setting that might otherwise be performed at our surgery centers 
in recent years  pain management and gastrointestinal procedures have been performed increasingly in an office based setting 
although physicians who own an interest in our centers are subject to non competition agreements  these non competition agreements may not restrict procedures performed in a physician office 
also  because non competition agreements are difficult to enforce  we may be unsuccessful in preventing physicians who own an interest in our centers from acquiring an interest in a competing facility 
in addition  the physicians who use our facilities may choose not to accept patients who pay for services through certain third party payors  which could reduce our revenues 
in of the surgery centers in which we own an interest  a single physician performed over of the total number of cases performed at the center during from time to time  we may have disputes with physicians who use our facilities and or own interests in our centers or our company 
our revenues and profitability could be significantly reduced if we lost our relationship with one or more key physicians or groups of physicians or if a key physician or group ceased or reduced his or its use of our facilities 
in addition  any damage to the reputation of a key physician or group of physicians or the failure of these physicians to provide quality medical care or adhere to professional guidelines at our facilities could damage our reputation  subject us to liability and significantly reduce our revenues 
we also manage three physician networks that accounted for about of our revenues during the year ended december  the termination of any of our contracts to manage our physician networks would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
we have a limited history operating many of our centers 
since january  we have acquired surgery centers and developed surgery centers  including three surgery centers that we subsequently divested 
several of these centers have been acquired or developed in the past few years and we have limited experience in operating the facilities 
as a result  we have a limited history of operations upon which you can evaluate us or our prospects 
forecasts of our future revenues  expenses and operating results may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer history of operations 

table of contents if we fail to comply with legislative and regulatory rules relating to privacy and security of patient health information and standards for electronic transactions  we may experience delays in payment of claims and increased costs and be subject to substantial fines 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  mandates the adoption of security and integrity standards related to patient information 
hipaa also standardizes the method for identifying providers  employers  health plans and patients 
final rules implementing the security and integrity portion of hipaa were adopted february  with a mandatory implementation date of april  we believe that we are in compliance with the privacy portions of hipaa  and that we will be in compliance with the security and integrity portions of hipaa by the implementation date 
we have and will continue to use substantial resources in the implementation of the privacy and security portions of hipaa  and we believe that the cost of continued compliance with hipaa will be significant 
however  if we fail to comply with the requirements of hipaa  we could be subject to civil penalties of up to  per calendar year for each provision contained in the privacy  security and transaction regulations that is violated and criminal penalties of up to  per violation for certain other violations 
since there is no significant history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time  it is not possible to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with these regulations or the potential for fines and penalties which may result from the violation of the regulations 
if we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the operation of our facilities  we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
we are subject to many laws and regulations at the federal  state and local government levels in which we operate 
these laws and regulations require that our facilities meet various licensing  certification and other requirements  including those relating to qualification of medical and support persons  pricing of services by health care providers  the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  maintenance and protection of records  and environmental protection  health and safety 
if we fail or have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we could suffer civil or criminal penalties  including becoming the subject of cease and desist orders  the loss of our licenses to operate and disqualification from medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored health care programs 
in pursuing our growth strategy  we may seek to expand our presence into new geographic markets 
in new geographic markets  we may encounter laws and regulations that differ from those applicable to our current operations 
if we are unable to comply with these legal requirements in a cost effective manner  we may be unable to expand geographically 
our facilities do not satisfy all of the requirements for any of the safe harbors under the federal anti kickback statute 
if we fail to comply with the federal anti kickback statute  we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties  loss of licenses and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs  which may result in a substantial loss of revenues 
a provision of the social security act  commonly referred to as the federal anti kickback statute  prohibits the offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring  ordering  leasing  purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering  purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by medicare  medicaid  or any other federally funded health care program 
the federal anti kickback statute is very broad in scope and many of its provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by existing case law or regulations 
violations of the federal anti kickback statute may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties  including criminal fines of up to  and civil penalties of up to  for each violation  plus three times the 
table of contents remuneration involved or the amount claimed and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
the exclusion  if applied to our facilities  could result in significant reductions in our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  many of the states in which we operate have also adopted laws  similar to the federal anti kickback statute  that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals  some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care 
these statutes typically impose criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licenses 
no state or federal regulatory actions have been taken against our facilities under anti kickback or self referral statutes during the time we have owned or managed the facilities 
management is not aware of any such actions prior to our acquisition or management of these facilities 
in july  the department of health and human services issued final regulations defining various safe harbors 
business arrangements that meet the requirements of the safe harbors are deemed to be in compliance with the federal anti kickback statute 
business arrangements that do not meet the safe harbor requirements do not necessarily violate the federal anti kickback statute  but may be subject to scrutiny by the federal government to determine compliance 
two of the safe harbors issued in apply to business arrangements similar to those used in connection with our surgery centers the investment interest safe harbor and the personal services and management contracts safe harbor 
however  the structure of the partnerships and limited liability companies operating our facilities  as well as our business arrangements involving physician networks  do not satisfy all of the requirements of either safe harbor 
on november   the department of health and human services issued final regulations creating additional safe harbor provisions  including a safe harbor that applies to physician ownership of  or investment interests in  surgery centers 
these regulations do not apply to our facilities licensed as hospitals 
the surgery center safe harbor protects four types of investment arrangements 
each category has its own requirements with regard to what type of physician may be an investor in the surgery center 
in addition to the physician investor  the categories permit an unrelated investor  who is a person or entity that is not in a position to provide items or services related to the surgery center or its investors 
our business arrangements with our surgery centers typically consist of one or more of our subsidiaries being an investor in each partnership or limited liability company that owns the surgery center  in addition to providing management and other services to the surgery center 
as a result of these and other aspects of our business arrangements  including those relating to the composition of physician groups that own an interest in our facilities  these arrangements do not comply with all the requirements of the surgery center safe harbor and  therefore  are not immune from government review or prosecution 
if a federal or state agency asserts a different position or enacts new laws or regulations regarding illegal remuneration under the medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties  experience a significant reduction in our revenues or be excluded from participation in the medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs 
any change in interpretations or enforcement of existing or new laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality  or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services  pricing  capital expenditure programs and operating expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations or reduce the demand for or profitability of our services 
additionally  new federal or state laws may be enacted that would cause our relationships with physician investors to become illegal or result in the imposition of penalties against us or our facilities 
if any of our business arrangements with physician investors were deemed to violate the federal anti kickback statute or similar laws  or if new federal or state laws were enacted rendering these arrangements illegal  our business could be adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with physician self referral laws as they are currently interpreted or may be interpreted in the future  or if other legislative restrictions are issued  we could incur a significant loss of reimbursement revenues 
the federal physician self referral law  commonly referred to as the stark law  prohibits a physician from making a medicare or medicaid reimbursed referral for a designated health service to an entity if the physician or a member of the physician s immediate family has a financial relationship with the entity 
designated health services include a number of services  including clinical laboratory services  radiology and certain other imaging services and inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
under the current stark law and related regulations  services 
table of contents provided at a surgery center are not covered by stark  even if those services include imaging  laboratory services or other stark designated health services  provided that the surgery center does not bill for these services separately 
however  services provided at our facilities licensed as hospitals are covered by the stark law 
the stark law and similar state statutes are subject to different interpretations with respect to many important provisions 
violations of these self referral laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties  including large civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
exclusion of our surgery centers from these programs through future judicial or agency interpretation of existing laws or additional legislative restrictions on physician ownership or investments in health care entities could result in a significant loss of reimbursement revenues 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of could restrict our ability to operate our facilities licensed as hospitals and could adversely impact our reimbursement revenues 
the medicare modernization act was signed into law on december  among other things  the medicare modernization act amended the stark law to provide that an exception in the stark law relating to physician ownership in hospitals does not apply to specialty hospitals for a period of months following november  specialty hospitals are defined in the medicare modernization act as hospitals that are primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of patients with a cardiac condition  patients with an orthopedic condition  patients receiving a surgical procedure or any other specialized category of services that the secretary of the department of health and human services designates as inconsistent with the purpose of the hospital ownership exception 
the month moratorium does not apply to specialty hospitals that were in existence or under development on november   as long as a the total number of physician investors in the hospital does not increase from the number of physician investors on november   b the hospital does not change the type of specialty services that it provides from the types that it provided on november   and c the hospital does not increase its number of beds by more than or five beds  whichever is greater 
the medicare modernization act also directs the department of health and human services and medpac to conduct studies of specialty hospitals by february  and to prepare reports to congress recommending any needed legislative or administrative changes in the stark law s exception for physician ownership in hospitals 
as of march   the department of health and human services had not completed its study 
medpac recently recommended to the congress that the month moratorium on new specialty hospitals be extended for an additional months 
congress has not yet acted on that recommendation 
three of our facilities  including one managed facility  are licensed as hospitals 
we may acquire additional facilities licensed as hospitals in the future 
two of our facilities licensed as hospitals  including the managed facility  currently fit within the medicare modernization act s definition of specialty hospital 
our other facility licensed as a hospital  in which we own a interest  primarily provides obstetrical and other women s health services and could be designated in the future by the secretary of the department of health and human services as a specialty hospital 
we are not able to increase the number of physician investors  significantly increase the number of licensed beds or change the type of specialty services that we provide in any of our specialty hospitals 
these legal constraints on the operation of these facilities could have an adverse financial effect on these facilities 
moreover  the studies and recommendations by medpac and the department of health and human services may not be favorable to specialty hospitals 
if future legislation is enacted that prohibits all physician referrals to specialty hospitals in which the physicians own an interest  even if those facilities already exist  our specialty hospitals could be materially adversely affected 
the medicare modernization act also limits increases in medicare reimbursement rates for ambulatory surgery centers 
under the medicare modernization act  the increase in medicare reimbursement rates for ambulatory surgery centers that became effective on october  is limited to an amount equal to the increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers as estimated by the secretary of the department of health and human services for the month period ended march   minus percentage points 
the medicare modernization act also provides that there will be no increase in these rates during the years through the medicare modernization act also directs the general accounting office to conduct a study comparing the cost of procedures in surgery centers to the cost of procedures performed in hospital outpatient departments 
the general accounting office was directed to submit the results of its study to cms by no later than january  however  no report has been publicly released to date 
cms is directed to develop a new ambulatory surgery center payment 
table of contents system based upon the medicare hospital outpatient department payment system so that it is effective on or after january  and no later than january  the medicare modernization act provides that  in the year that the new payment system is implemented  it must be designed to result in the same aggregate amount of expenditures for surgical services provided at ambulatory surgery centers as would be made if the new system were not adopted 
the rate changes mandated by the medicare modernization act could have an adverse effect on the revenues of our centers  but we cannot predict at this time the full effect of the payment rate revisions 
we may be subject to actions for false and other improper claims 
federal and state government agencies  as well as private payors  have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of the cost reporting and billing practices of health care organizations and their quality of care and financial relationships with referral sources 
in addition  the oig and the us department of justice have  from time to time  undertaken national enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse 
the us government is authorized to impose criminal  civil and administrative penalties on any person or entity that files a false claim for payment from the medicare or medicaid programs 
claims filed with private insurers can also lead to criminal and civil penalties  including  but not limited to  penalties relating to violations of federal mail and wire fraud statutes 
while the criminal statutes are generally reserved for instances of fraudulent intent  the us government is applying its criminal  civil and administrative penalty statutes in an ever expanding range of circumstances 
for example  the government has taken the position that a pattern of claiming reimbursement for unnecessary services violates these statutes if the claimant merely should have known the services were unnecessary  even if the government cannot demonstrate actual knowledge 
the government has also taken the position that claiming payment for low quality services is a violation of these statutes if the claimant should have known that the care was substandard 
in addition  some courts have held that a violation of the stark law can result in liability under the federal false claims act 
over the past several years  the us government has accused an increasing number of health care providers of violating the federal false claims act 
the false claims act prohibits a person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false or fraudulent claim to the us government 
the statute defines knowingly to include not only actual knowledge of a claim s falsity  but also reckless disregard for or intentional ignorance of the truth or falsity of a claim 
because our facilities perform hundreds of similar procedures a year for which they are paid by medicare  and there is a relatively long statute of limitations  a billing error or cost reporting error could result in significant civil or criminal penalties 
under the qui tam  or whistleblower  provisions of the false claims act  private parties may bring actions on behalf of the us government 
these private parties  often referred to as relators  are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government through trial or settlement 
both direct enforcement activity by the government and whistleblower lawsuits have increased significantly in recent years and have increased the risk that a health care company  like us  will have to defend a false claims action  pay fines or be excluded from the medicare and medicaid programs as a result of an investigation resulting from a whistleblower case 
although we believe that our operations comply with both federal and state laws  they may nevertheless be the subject of a whistleblower lawsuit  or may otherwise be challenged or scrutinized by governmental authorities 
a determination that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are also subject to various state insurance statutes and regulations that prohibit us from submitting inaccurate  incorrect or misleading claims 
we believe that our surgery centers are in material compliance with all state insurance laws and regulations regarding the submission of claims 
we cannot assure you  however  that none of our centers insurance claims will ever be challenged 
if we were found to be in violation of a state s insurance laws or regulations  we could be forced to discontinue the practice in violation  which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results  and we could be subject to fines and criminal penalties 

table of contents if laws governing the corporate practice of medicine change  we may be required to restructure some of our relationships  which may result in a significant loss of revenues and divert other resources 
the laws of various states in which we operate or may operate in the future do not permit business corporations to practice medicine  to exercise control over or employ physicians who practice medicine or to engage in various business practices  such as fee splitting with physicians 
the interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state 
we provide management services to three physician networks 
if our arrangements with these networks were deemed to violate state corporate practice of medicine  fee splitting or similar laws  or if new laws are enacted rendering our arrangements illegal  we may be required to restructure these arrangements  which may result in a significant loss of revenues and divert other resources 
we are liable for debts and other obligations of the partnerships and limited liability companies that own and operate some of our surgery centers 
we own and operate our surgery centers through limited partnerships  limited liability companies and one general partnership 
local physicians  physician groups and hospitals also own an interest in all but three of these partnerships and limited liability companies 
in the partnerships in which we are the general partner  we are liable for of the debts and other obligations of the partnership  even if we do not own all of the partnership interests 
we also guarantee the debts and other obligations of many of the partnerships and limited liability companies in which we own an interest 
our senior credit facility allows us to borrow up to million  including funds that we can lend to the partnerships and limited liability companies in which we own an interest 
the physicians and physician groups that own an interest in these partnerships and limited liability companies do not guarantee a pro rata amount of this debt or the other obligations of these partnerships and limited liability companies 
if our operations in new york are found not to be in compliance with new york law  we may be unable to continue or expand our operations in new york 
we own an interest in a limited liability company which provides administrative services to a surgery center located in new york 
new york law requires that  in order to be approved by the new york department of health as licensed health care facilities  corporations must have natural persons as stockholders 
accordingly  we are not able to own interests in a partnership or limited liability company that owns an interest in a new york health care facility 
new york law also prohibits the delegation of certain management functions by a licensed health care facility 
the law does permit a licensed facility to obtain various services from non licensed entities  however  it is not clear what types of delegation constitute a violation 
although we believe that our operations and relationships in new york are in compliance with these laws  if new york regulatory authorities or a third party asserts a contrary position we may be unable to continue or expand our operations in new york 
if regulations change  we may be obligated to purchase some or all of the ownership interests of our physician partners or renegotiate some of our partnership agreements with our physician partners and management agreements with surgery centers 
upon the occurrence of various fundamental regulatory changes or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations  we may be obligated to purchase all of the ownership interests of the physician investors in most of the partnerships or limited liability companies that own and operate our surgery centers 
the purchase price that we would be required to pay for these ownership interests is typically based on either a multiple of the center s ebitda or the fair market value of the ownership interests as determined by a third party appraisal 
the physician investors in some of our surgery centers can require us to purchase their interests in exchange for cash or shares of our common stock if these regulatory changes occur 
in addition  some of our partnership agreements with our physician partners and management agreements with surgery centers require us to attempt to renegotiate the agreements upon the occurrence of various fundamental regulatory changes or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations and provide for termination of the agreements if renegotiations are not successful 
regulatory changes that could create purchase or renegotiation obligations include changes that make illegal the referral of medicare or other patients to our surgery centers by physician investors  
table of contents create a substantial likelihood that cash distributions to physician investors from the partnerships or limited liability companies through which we operate our surgery centers would be illegal  or make illegal the ownership by the physician investors of interests in the partnerships or limited liability companies through which we own and operate our surgery centers 
we do not control whether or when any of these regulatory events might occur 
in the event we are required to purchase all of the physicians ownership interests  our existing capital resources would not be sufficient for us to meet this obligation 
these obligations and the possible termination of our partnership and management agreements would have a material adverse effect on us 
if we become subject to malpractice and related legal claims  we could be required to pay significant damages  which may not be covered by insurance 
in recent years  physicians  hospitals and other health care providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice  product liability or related legal theories 
many of these actions involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs 
we maintain liability insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate for our operations 
currently  we maintain professional and general liability insurance that provides coverage on a claims made basis of million per occurrence and million in annual aggregate coverage per facility 
we also maintain business interruption insurance and property damage insurance  as well as an additional umbrella liability insurance policy in the aggregate amount of million 
however  this insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us 
insurance coverage may not continue to be available at a cost allowing us to maintain adequate levels of insurance 
if one or more successful claims against us were not covered by or exceeded the coverage of our insurance  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
significant indebtedness could limit our ability to operate our business and pursue business opportunities 
as of february   we had outstanding debt of about million that we incurred to finance our acquisitions and developments and for other general corporate purposes 
our senior credit facility allows us to borrow up to million 
our significant indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  reducing the funds available to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  the majority of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and we are vulnerable to increases in interest rates  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited  we may be at a disadvantage to our competitors who are less leveraged  we may be more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy generally  our senior credit facility contains numerous financial and other restrictive covenants  including restrictions on paying dividends  incurring additional indebtedness and buying or selling assets  and our senior credit facility requires us to pledge the capital stock or other equity interests of our subsidiaries to the bank group as collateral security 

table of contents we face intense competition for physicians  strategic relationships  acquisitions and managed care contracts  which may result in a decline in our revenues  profitability and market share 
the health care business is highly competitive 
we compete with other health care providers  primarily hospitals and other surgery centers  in recruiting physicians to utilize our facilities and in contracting with managed care payors in each of our markets 
there are unaffiliated hospitals in each market in which we operate 
these hospitals have established relationships with physicians and payors 
in addition  other companies either are currently in the same or similar business of developing  acquiring and operating surgery centers and other facilities or may decide to enter our business 
many of these companies have greater resources than we do  including financial  marketing  staff and capital resources 
we may also compete with some of these companies for entry into strategic relationships with health care systems and health care professionals 
in addition  many physician groups develop surgery centers without a corporate partner  utilizing consultants who perform services for a fee and do not take an equity interest in the ongoing operations of the center 
in recent years  more physicians are choosing to perform procedures  including pain management and gastrointestinal procedures  in an office based setting rather than in a surgery center or hospital 
if we are unable to compete effectively with any of these entities or groups  we may be unable to implement our business strategies successfully and our business could be adversely affected 
a large number of our surgery centers are located in texas and florida  which makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory  economic and other conditions in those states 
in addition  three of our surgery centers account for a significant portion of our revenues 
our revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory  economic and other conditions in the states of texas and florida 
as of march   we operated seven surgery centers in texas and seven surgery centers in florida 
the surgery centers in texas represented about of our revenues during and the surgery centers in florida represented about of our revenues during in addition  wilmington surgcare in wilmington  north carolina  physicians surgical specialty hospital in houma  louisiana and northstar surgical center in lubbock  texas generated about  and  respectively  of our revenues during if these facilities are adversely affected by regulatory  economic and other conditions  or if these facilities do not perform effectively  our operating results will be adversely affected 
none of our remaining surgery centers accounted for more than of our revenues during we depend on our senior management and we may be adversely affected if we lose any member of our senior management 
we are highly dependent on our senior management  including richard e 
francis  jr  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and clifford g 
adlerz  our president and chief operating officer 
we have entered into employment agreements with messrs 
francis and adlerz and william v 
b 
webb  our chief development officer 
the initial term of each of these agreements is three years  which is automatically extended so that the term is three years until terminated 
we may terminate each employment agreement for cause 
in addition  either party may terminate the employment agreement at any time by giving prior written notice to the other party 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our officers 
because our senior management has contributed greatly to our growth since inception  the loss of key management personnel or our inability to attract  retain and motivate sufficient numbers of qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on us 
we face risks related to compliance with corporate governance laws and financial reporting standards 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as related new rules and regulations implemented by the securities and exchange commission  nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board  required changes in the corporate governance practices and financial reporting standards for public companies 
these new laws  rules and regulations  including compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of relating to internal control over financial reporting section  have materially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming and more burdensome 
we became a public company in february and we are required to comply with the provisions of section commencing with our fiscal year ending december  despite our intent to be fully compliant with section by that time  we run the risk of non compliance which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively  our operations could be disrupted 
our operations depend significantly on effective information systems 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions from  and the integration of  various information systems 
if we experience difficulties with the transition from information systems or are unable to maintain properly or expand our information systems  we could suffer  among other things  operational disruptions and increases in administrative expenses 
risks related to our corporate structure we may have a special legal responsibility to the holders of ownership interests in the entities through which we own our surgery centers  which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders and prevent us from acting solely in our own best interests or the interests of our stockholders 
our ownership interests in surgery centers generally are held through limited partnerships or limited liability companies in which we maintain an ownership interest along with physicians or physician practice groups 
as general partner or manager of these entities  we may have a special responsibility  known as a fiduciary duty  to manage these entities in the best interests of the other interest holders 
we also have a duty to operate our business for the benefit of our stockholders 
as a result  we may encounter conflicts between our responsibility to the other interest holders and our responsibility to our stockholders 
for example  we have entered into management agreements to provide management services to our surgery centers in exchange for a fee 
disputes may arise as to the nature of the services to be provided or the amount of the fee to be paid 
in these cases  we are obligated to exercise reasonable  good faith judgment to resolve the disputes and may not be free to act solely in our own best interests or the interests of our stockholders 
disputes may also arise between us and our physician investors with respect to a particular business decision or regarding the interpretation of the provisions of the applicable limited partnership agreement or operating agreement 
we seek to avoid these disputes but have not implemented any measures to resolve these conflicts if they arise 
if we are unable to resolve a dispute on terms favorable or satisfactory to us  our business may be adversely affected 
we are a holding company with no operations of our own 
we are a holding company and our ability to service our debt and pay dividends  if any  is dependent upon the earnings from the business conducted by our subsidiaries 
the distributions of those earnings or advances or other distributions of funds by these subsidiaries to us  all of which are contingent upon the subsidiaries earnings  are subject to various business considerations 
in addition  distributions by subsidiaries could be subject to statutory restrictions  including state laws requiring that the subsidiary be solvent  or contractual restrictions 
we do not have exclusive control over the distribution of cash from our operating entities and may be unable to cause all or a portion of the cash of these entities to be distributed 
all of the surgery centers in which we have ownership interests are held through partnerships or limited liability companies 
we typically own  directly or indirectly  the general partnership or majority member interests in these entities 
the partnership and operating agreements for these entities provide for distribution of available cash  in some cases on a quarterly basis 
if we are unable to cause sufficient revenues to be distributed from one or more of these entities  our relationships with the physicians who also own an interest in these entities may be damaged and we could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to resolve favorably any dispute regarding revenue distribution or other matters with a health care system with which we share control of the distributions made by these entities 
further  the failure to resolve a dispute with these health care systems could cause an entity in which we own an interest to be dissolved 

table of contents our stockholder rights plan  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could prevent or discourage a change in our management or a takeover you may consider favorable 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan 
the rights plan may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that you may consider favorable 
the rights plan may also entrench our management by making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to replace or remove our management or board of directors 
in addition  some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that you may consider favorable or the removal of our current management 
these provisions authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent without the approval of our board of directors  limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters to be approved at meetings of stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also prohibit the amendment of many of the provisions in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws by our stockholders unless the amendment is approved by the holders of at least of our shares of common stock 
in addition  delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in our control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder 
because our management and their affiliates together own a large percentage of our common stock  they will be able to exert significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  regardless of the preferences of our other stockholders 
as of february   our officers  directors and their affiliates together beneficially owned about of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders are able to exert significant influence over the election of our board of directors  our management and policies  and the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
our officers  directors and their affiliates are also able to exert significant influence over a change in our control or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 
in addition  we granted registration rights to these stockholders covering all shares of our stock that they own 
their interests may conflict with the interests of other holders of common stock and they may take actions affecting us with which you disagree 
risks related to our common stock because we have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  you should not expect to receive dividends on shares of our common stock 
we currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings  if any  to finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any 
table of contents payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition  capital requirements  earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
further  under the terms of our senior credit facility  we are restricted from paying cash dividends and making other distributions to our stockholders 
our stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
before february   there was no public market for our common stock 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline  perhaps substantially  including our failure or delay in meeting our development and acquisition plans  our revenues and operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  changes in laws and regulations governing health care and the surgery center industry  proposed or enacted changes in reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors  changes in securities analysts financial estimates or recommendations  investor perception of our industry or our prospects  and general economic trends and market conditions  including factors unrelated to our operating performance 
in the past  other companies in the health care industry have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock and have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
we may be involved in securities class action litigation in the future which could divert our management s attention and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in prevailing interest rates 
historically  we have not held or issued derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps 
our outstanding debt to commercial lenders is generally based on a predetermined percentage above libor or the lenders prime rate 
at december   million of our total long term debt was subject to variable rates of interest  while the remaining million of our total long term debt was subject to fixed rates of interest 
a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of  the fair value of our long term debt  based on a discounted cash flow analysis  approximates its carrying value as of december
