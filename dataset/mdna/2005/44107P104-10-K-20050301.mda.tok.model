item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in forward looking statements and risk factors contained elsewhere in this report 
overview structure and business we own full service luxury and upper upscale hotel properties and  as of february   hmc was the largest hotel reit in the national association of real estate investment trust s composite index 
a reit is a legal entity that holds real estate interests and  through payments of dividends to stockholders  is permitted to reduce or avoid federal income taxes at the corporate level 
hmc operates as a self managed and self administered reit  which means that we are managed by a board of directors and executive officers 
we conduct our operations through host lp and its subsidiaries  which hold substantially all of our assets 
hmc is the sole general partner of host lp and owns approximately of the partnership interests 
our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry including marriott  ritz carlton  hyatt  four seasons  fairmont  hilton and westin 
approximately of our hotels as measured by sales are managed by marriott international or its affiliates and branded under the marriott or ritz carlton brand names 
the majority of our properties are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort conference locations 
the target profile for our portfolio includes luxury and upper upscale full service properties in urban and resort conference locations which benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors 
though hotels meeting this target profile will still be subject to competitive pressures  we believe this will allow us to maintain room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors 
we also seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management  by assisting the managers of our hotels in maximizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements 
the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business  group business  and contract business approximately  and  respectively  of our business in 
our transient business  which includes the individual corporate and leisure traveler  is generally accommodated at a premium rate when compared to other customer types 
group business includes hotel bookings related to conferences and events 
the remainder of our customer base results from contracts for a specified number of rooms over a fixed period 
our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements under which they earn base and incentive management fees related to revenues and profitability of each individual hotel 
we provide operating funds  or working capital  which the managers use to operate the property including purchasing inventory and paying wages  utilities  property taxes and other expenses 
we generally receive a cash distribution  which reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses excluding depreciation  from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period  depending on the manager 

table of contents hotel revenue is approximately of our total revenue 
the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue of revenues rooms revenue 
occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and premium versus discount business is the key driver of room rates 
food and beverage revenue 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue ie  group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business  which may or may not utilize the restaurant outlets 
other revenue 
occupancy  the nature of the property ie  resort  etc 
and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue  such as parking  golf course  spa  telephone  entertainment and other guest services 
hotel operating expenses are approximately of our total operating costs and expenses 
the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses of operating costs and expenses rooms expense 
these costs include housekeeping  reservation systems  room supplies  laundry services and front desk costs 
occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense 
these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages  as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided 
food and beverage expense 
these expenses primarily include food  beverage and labor costs 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel ie  catered functions are generally more profitable than outlet sales are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue 
hotel departmental expense 
these expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other ancillary revenues such as parking  golf courses  spas  telephones  entertainment and other guest services  as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments  sales and marketing  repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs 
management fees 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue as set forth in our management contracts 
incentive management fees are generally paid when operating profits exceed threshold levels established in our management agreements 
other property level expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent and property insurance 
many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change in tandem with changes in revenues at our hotels 
depreciation and amortization expense 
this is a non cash expense which is relatively inflexible and changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of post acquisition capital expenditures 
key performance indicators we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
revenue per available room  or revpar  is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 

table of contents revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include revenues from food and beverage or parking  telephone  or other guest services generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
we also use revpar to evaluate the results of individual hotels between periods and our comparable hotels 
see comparable hotel operating statistics for further discussion of what we consider to be our comparable hotels 
revpar changes driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes driven predominately by average room rate 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues  such as food and beverage  as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
revpar increases due to higher room rates  however  would not result in these additional room related costs 
for this reason  while operating profit typically increases when occupancy rises  revpar increases due to higher room rates would have a greater impact on our profitability 
a related revenue measure for our hotels is the revpar penetration index 
the revpar penetration index reflects each property s revpar in relation to the revpar for that property s competitive set 
we use the measure as an indicator of a property s market share 
for example  a revpar penetration index of would indicate that a hotel s revpar is  on average  the same as its competitors 
a revpar penetration index exceeding would indicate that a hotel maintains a revpar premium in relation to its competitive set  while a revpar penetration index below would be an indicator that a hotel is underperforming its competitive set 
one critical component in this calculation is the determination of a hotel s competitive set 
factors that we consider include geographic proximity  as well as the level of service provided at the property 
for example  a hotel located near a convention center might have a competitive set that includes other hotels located in close proximity to the convention center 
in addition  a luxury hotel might include other luxury or upper upscale hotels in its competitive set but not economy hotels 
competitive set determinations are highly subjective  however  and our methodology for determining a hotel s competitive set may differ materially from those used by other owners and or managers 
we assess profitability by measuring changes in our operating margins  which are operating profit as a percentage of total revenues 
another key profitability indicator we use is hotel adjusted operating profit which is a non gaap measure  and which is used to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels 
hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before funding furniture  fixtures and equipment reserves and debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual property level profitability 
the comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels 
see non gaap financial measures comparable hotel operating results for further discussion 
we also use  among other things  ffo per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability 
see non gaap financial measures ffo per diluted share for further discussion 
each of the non gaap measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues  operating profit and earnings per share 
outlook for  revpar increased approximately at our comparable hotels as compared to we believe that lodging demand will continue to grow in and  in particular  as corporate group and corporate transient business strengthen  we believe that revpar at our hotels will continue to increase 
improvements in revpar for the first half of were primarily driven by increases in occupancy at our hotels 
in the second half of  increases in revpar were attributable to increases in both occupancy and average room rates 
we expect that demand will continue to grow and allow for additional growth in average room rates in this is a result of a number of positive trends such as strong us gdp growth  low supply growth of new hotels  a continued increase in corporate transient demand and a solid group booking pace 
historically  we have seen that lodging demand in the united states correlates to gdp growth  with typically a one to two quarter lag period  
table of contents especially within the luxury and upper upscale sectors of the lodging industry 
therefore  given the relatively strong us gdp growth in and the gdp forecasts for  we are optimistic about improvements in lodging demand in as a result of these trends  we expect our comparable hotel revpar to increase approximately to for in addition to the favorable demand trends forecast to affect the lodging industry in general  we believe we will be able to capitalize on the low supply growth trends that have existed during the past few years 
supply growth in the lodging industry and the geographic markets in which we operate may be influenced by a number of factors  including growth of the economy  interest rates  local considerations and the relatively long lead time required to build urban and resort conference hotels 
we believe that the low construction levels over the past few years  together with low expectations for additional supply growth over the next few years  will lead to an imbalance between supply and growing demand that will allow for improved revpar performance at our hotels 
in terms of profitability measures  operating margins were relatively unchanged for the first half of however  operating margins increased in the second half of  as the average room rate increases at our hotels began to exceed the rate of inflation for the first time since  resulting in an overall increase for the full year for our comparable hotels 
operating margins continue to be affected by certain of our costs  primarily wages  benefits  utilities and sales and marketing  which increased at a rate greater than inflation 
we expect these costs to continue to increase at a rate greater than inflation in the near term 
as noted above  approximately of our revenues are from food and beverage operations 
during  food and beverage revenue growth at our comparable hotels was 
as the economy continues to expand in  we expect to see an increase in our catering revenues  which should improve our food and beverage operating margins 
we also may see improvements in revpar and operating margins as we continue our strategy of recycling assets 
as noted below  over the past year we have been acquiring upper upscale and luxury properties in urban and resort conference locations  where further large scale lodging development is limited  and selling assets in suburban  secondary and tertiary markets 
the assets we have been acquiring have higher revpar  higher operating margins and  we believe  higher growth potential than those we have sold 
over time  this should contribute to improvements in overall revpar and operating margins 
during  the average revpar penetration index for our comparable hotels modestly declined  but it remains at a premium in relation to our competitive set 
this follows a similar decline in our average revpar penetration index for our comparable hotels in market share at our urban and airport hotels increased slightly in  reversing the prior year trend as a result of the increase in business travel  however  market share continued to decline at our suburban properties and our larger convention hotels 
we believe that this decline in market share over the past two years occurred because our hotels generally have a higher percentage of their revenues generated by corporate group and corporate transient customers than their competitors and that business in the upper upscale and luxury segment did not begin to significantly increase until the second half of  certain of our properties overcommitted to lower rated group business late in  which has resulted in those properties being unable to take advantage of higher rated transient business as travel increased in  we have a significant number of large hotels in our portfolio  including nine convention hotels with greater than  rooms  which require longer periods of time to rebuild their customer base  and new supply in several of our markets affected our hotels 
as lodging demand continues to grow and  in particular  as corporate group and corporate transient business strengthens  we believe that our hotels may regain the majority of the market share lost in and 
table of contents while we believe the combination of improved demand trends and low supply growth trends in the lodging industry creates the possibility for improvements in our business in  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue 
the trends discussed above may not occur for any number of reasons  including slower than anticipated growth in the economy  business investment and employment and changes in travel patterns  and the continued threat of additional terrorist attacks  high oil prices  airline strikes and other factors that may have an adverse impact on travel and lodging demand 
all of the above  as well as the risks set forth in the section forward looking statements may result in lower revenues or higher operating costs and declining operating margins 
management s priorities based on forecasted operating conditions  our key management priorities over the next several years include the following to work with our managers to increase revenues and minimize operating costs  to invest capital in our existing portfolio to maintain our assets and pursue repositioning roi opportunities 
potential investments at our hotels could include increasing the number of rooms  building a spa  fitness facility  convention or meeting space or upgrading the infrastructure  such as energy efficient heating and cooling systems  to invest in opportunities to enhance the value of existing assets by converting underutilized space to alternate uses such as timeshare or condominium units  to acquire upper upscale and luxury hotels in unique locations  including hotels in urban and resort conference locations  to use the proceeds from the sale of non core hotels to acquire properties more closely aligned with our target profile or to repay debt  and to reduce our leverage  over time  to achieve an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of x or greater under our senior notes indenture and seek to maintain a balanced maturity schedule with an average maturity of no less than five years 
in furtherance of these objectives  we acquired three hotels in valued at approximately million the fairmont kea lani maui  the embassy suites chicago downtown lakefront and the scottsdale marriott at mcdowell mountains 
we sold nine non core properties in for million and another four properties in january for million 
we also committed to sell by march  subject to several closing conditions  of our interest in the cbm joint venture  which owns courtyard by marriott properties 
additionally  we raised billion through financing activities in  using those funds along with funds raised through asset dispositions to acquire properties and to repay or refinance billion in senior notes and million in mortgage debt  all of which improved our interest coverage ratio and our overall leverage ratio 
similarly  in we spent approximately million on repositioning and roi projects  including commencing a million renovation and repositioning of our newport beach marriott hotel 
as part of this project  we have negotiated to sell land which currently houses a tennis facility at this property to a high end condominium developer 
in  we committed to invest approximately million for the development of a  square foot exhibit hall at the orlando world center marriott resort and convention center  or the orlando marriott world center 
we expect to spend million to million on such investments in the next several years 
by contrast  we had limited our expenditures on such development projects in and based on our assessment of the relatively weak operating environment and to preserve capital 

table of contents for further detail on each of the above transactions  see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources 
we believe we successfully executed on a number of these management priorities in based on the positive trends in the hotel industry noted above  as well as improving conditions in the financial markets 
there can be no assurances  however  that these trends will continue in or that we will be able to continue to execute on all  or any  of these priorities in or over the next several years

we discuss operating results for our full service hotels on a comparable basis  which is properties that we have owned throughout the entire year  while eliminating the results of properties acquired or sold  or that incurred significant property damage or large scale capital improvements during these periods 
as of december   of our full service hotels have been classified as comparable hotels 
the following discussion is of the sales results of our comparable hotels considering the mix of business ie transient or group  property type ie urban  suburban  resort conference or airport and geographic region 
see comparable hotel operating statistics for a complete description of our comparable hotels and further detail on these classifications 

table of contents comparable hotel sales by customer mix 
the majority of our customers fall into two broad groups transient and group travelers 
continuing a trend we noted in the first three quarters of  the business mix of our portfolio is showing a shift in transient room nights  from lower rated discount business to higher rated corporate and premium business 
for  total transient room revenue for our comparable marriott and ritz carlton hotels was up compared to last year  as premium and corporate occupancy increased to of total transient demand  up from last year  while our average transient room rate increased by 
this indicates that our hotel managers are having greater success in reducing the number of rooms sold at discounted rates as a result of improving transient demand 
we believe the upward trend in occupancy and average room rate should continue as a result of increased corporate and premium business in the fourth quarter 
for  total group room revenue for our comparable marriott and ritz carlton hotels was up compared to last year  primarily due to an increase in occupancy of approximately  while our average group room rate was up slightly  or 
this increase reflects the increased business travel and the steady growth in the economy 
additionally  our managers improved overall occupancy by accepting greater numbers of advance room reservations for groups  which resulted in fewer rooms available for transient business 
we expect this trend to reverse in comparable hotel sales by property type 
for full year  revenues increased consistently across all of our hotel property types 
comparable hotel revpar increased   and for urban  suburban  resort conference and airport properties  respectively 
the largest increases were for our airport hotels  which reflects a significant increase in business travel in compared with the significantly depressed levels of and the performance of our portfolio is significantly affected by the size of our hotels  including our large convention hotels  the majority of which are included in urban properties 
convention hotels have historically outperformed in the early stages of an industry downturn  however  they also lag the industry in performance in the early stages of recovery 
this is due to the longer booking lead time for large group business and the level of transient demand required for the greater capacity of rooms 
as with other recoveries  we expect that these hotels will ultimately outperform and their performance will stay relatively strong for a longer period of time 
comparable hotel sales by geographic region 
during  we experienced revpar gains in most regions 
full year comparable hotel revpar in our new england region improved over the prior year 
the region benefited from the democratic national convention during the third quarter and was led by the boston hyatt  which was converted from the swiss tel brand in late  where revpar improved by for the year 
comparable hotel revpar increased for our dc metro region due primarily to a increase in average room rates in growth was slowed during the year by rooms renovations at four of our hotels in the region 
we expect that the region will experience strong revpar growth in due to the presidential inauguration  the overall strength of the market and the negative effect of the rooms renovations in for our atlanta region  comparable hotel revpar grew by 
the improvement was led by the grand hyatt  atlanta  the four seasons  atlanta and the ritz carlton  atlanta  where revpar increased  and  respectively 
our pacific region  which had lagged behind the portfolio as a whole during and  continued to improve as comparable hotel revpar increased  with significant increases in occupancy 
the primary reason this region had been underperforming over the past three years was due to the decline in travel related to the area s technology companies  particularly in the san francisco bay area 
the improvement in the pacific region in reflects an increase in comparable hotel revpar at our san francisco market hotels of 

table of contents the results for the pacific region also reflect a increase in comparable hotel revpar at our properties in the los angeles market 
overall  we expect the pacific region to continue to exhibit improving performance in comparable hotel revpar in our mid atlantic region improved over the prior year 
our new york city properties benefited from the republican national convention in the third quarter and strong demand in the fourth quarter 
for  comparable hotel revpar in the florida region improved over during august and september  four hurricanes caused significant damage in florida 
our properties in the region and the new orleans marriott experienced varying levels of property damage and business interruption 
during  we recorded million of non recoverable losses 
we believe that the hurricanes could have a modest impact on business next year  as planners of group business may elect to book business in other markets during the hurricane season 
revpar in other regions was relatively unchanged from revpar declined in our south central region  while revpar in our north central and mountain regions experienced comparable revpar increases of and  respectively 
comparable hotel revpar for our international properties increased for our four canadian properties  three of which are in toronto  experienced increases in revpar of  as the region has recovered from the sars related travel restrictions in and the effect of the favorable appreciation of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
rental income 
our rental income represents lease income from our limited service hotels and three office property leases  as well as lease income from one full service hotel 
in  operations at the leased limited service hotel properties suffered because a significant portion of these properties underwent renovations to enable them to compete with newer hotels and the weak economic conditions in their markets 
while several leased properties were still under renovation in  the properties that underwent renovations in performed substantially better 
this was the primary reason for the increase in total rental income of million to million during operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses increased million  or  to billion 
the operating costs and expenses include the costs of three properties acquired in  totaling approximately million  and exclude the costs for properties we sold or that are classified as held for sale  the results of which are included in discontinued operations 
property level expenses  which account for of our total operating costs and expenses  increased million  or  to approximately billion 
comparable hotel expenses increased million  or  to billion 
the increase in operating costs and expenses is due to additional costs associated with an increase in occupancy at our hotels and an increase in wage  benefit  utility and sales and marketing costs  all of which we believe will continue to increase at a rate greater than inflation 
operating costs and expenses also include base and incentive management fees  which are earned based on the operating performance of our individual hotels 
due to the difficult operating environment over the past three years  less than half of our hotels reached the necessary thresholds in that would require us to incur incentive management fees to our managers 
in and  incentive management fees totaled million and million  respectively 
we expect the number of hotels reaching these thresholds and the incentive fees earned to further increase in corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and bonuses and other costs such as employee stock based compensation expense  corporate insurance  audit fees  building rent and system costs 
during  the million increase is primarily due to an increase in stock 
table of contents compensation expense  as a result of the significant appreciation in our stock price since december  and an increase in the number of shares that may be issued that are subject to performance criteria established by the compensation policy committee of the board of directors 
interest expense 
during  interest expense decreased million 
interest expense for includes million of interest which was previously classified as dividends on convertible preferred securities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense also includes million and million of call premiums and accelerated deferred financing costs and original issue discounts that were associated with debt prepayments made in and  respectively 
after excluding these items  interest expense decreased approximately million due to the significant amount of debt repayments and refinancings that have occurred in and see liquidity and capital resources cash requirements debt repayments and refinancings 
net gains on property transactions 
net gains on property transactions are due primarily to the recognition of deferred gains 
in  we sold a portfolio of fairfield inns by marriott and received a note receivable in partial payment 
subsequently  we recorded a loss on the note due to a decline in the operations of the hotels 
during  the owner filed for bankruptcy and several properties were sold 
we recognized a previously deferred gain of approximately million based on the amount of the proceeds we received 
loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts 
during  the loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts is primarily due to the approximate million loss from the foreign currency exchange contracts related to mortgage debt that was secured by three of our canadian hotels for the majority of as the us dollar continued to decline in relation to the canadian dollar 
these contracts were deemed ineffective for hedge accounting purposes in  which resulted in an million loss at that time 
see liquidity and capital resources debt and effect of financial covenants mortgage debt covenants for further discussion 
minority interest expense 
minority interest expense consists of our minority partners share of the income or loss in consolidated hotel partnerships and the approximate ownership in host lp 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates consists of our portion of the earnings losses of two partnerships in which we own non controlling interests 
the decrease in the loss can be attributed to a decrease in the net loss of cbm joint venture llc in and an increase in the income from our investment in tiburon golf ventures  lp see investments in affiliates for a discussion of these partnerships 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of nine hotels sold in  eight hotels sold in  one hotel sold in  the gain on the disposition and business interruption proceeds for the new york marriott world trade center hotel in and and four properties classified as held for sale as of december   all of which were sold in january in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas  the results of operations for these properties in the current year and prior periods are reflected in discontinued operations 
for  the nine hotels sold generated net proceeds of approximately million with a net gain on disposition of approximately million 
our revenues for the properties sold in and or classified as held for sale at december  and the final disposition of insurance proceeds for the new york marriott world trade center hotel were million for and million for income before taxes for the same periods was million and million  respectively 
compared to hotel sales 
hotel sales declined million  or  to approximately billion 
hotel sales for include approximately million for one hotel acquired in and exclude sales for the properties we have sold in and or classified as held for sale in  which have been reclassified to discontinued 
table of contents operations 
see discontinued operations below 
we discuss operating results for our hotels on a comparable basis  and as of december   of our full service hotels owned on that date were classified as comparable for and for  our comparable hotel revpar of was down from  reflecting a decline in average room rate of and a decrease in occupancy of percentage points  primarily due to reduced transient demand for both business and leisure travel 
beginning in the fourth quarter  demand began to improve relative to the first three quarters of  with less than one half a percent decrease in room rate and a slight decrease in occupancy over the fourth quarter of comparable hotel revpar by property type decreased   and for urban  suburban  resort conference and airport properties  respectively 
while our overall results for declined  we did experience improvements in comparable hotel revpar in four geographic regions for the fourth quarter and two regions for the full year 
comparable hotel revpar for our washington dc metro region increased for the fourth quarter and for the full year 
these increases were driven by strong transient demand particularly at our northern virginia properties as occupancy increased percentage points for both the fourth quarter and full year for the comparable hotels 
our florida region also had a slight increase in comparable hotel revpar for the year  but a slight decrease for the fourth quarter 
the results were primarily driven by our properties in the ft 
lauderdale and tampa markets  which benefited from stronger group demand and leisure travel 
the relative improvement of these regions was offset by the overall decline in comparable hotel revpar in most of our other regions 
in particular  our new england and south central regions had significant declines in comparable hotel revpar of and  respectively  for the year and and  respectively  for the fourth quarter 
the comparable hotel results in the south central region were primarily affected by our hotels in san antonio where full year occupancy was down percentage points and average room rate declined 
the decline in our new england properties was driven by the performance of our three comparable hotels in boston which had comparable hotel revpar declines of and  respectively  for the fourth quarter and full year 
the decrease in demand was primarily attributable to a reduction in city wide convention activity in the new england results discussed above do not include the boston copley marriott which is considered a non comparable hotel  which had an increase in revpar for the fourth quarter of 
our rental income represents lease income from our limited service hotels and three office property leases  as well as lease income from one full service hotel 
operations at the leased limited service hotel properties continued to suffer due to increased competition from full service and limited service properties and weak economic conditions in their markets  resulting in a very competitive environment and lower room rates 
in  we also recognized million of other income from the settlement of a claim that we brought against our directors and officers insurance carriers for reimbursement of defense costs and settlement payments incurred in resolving a series of related actions brought against us and marriott international which arose from the sale of certain limited partnerships units to investors prior to operating costs and expenses 
the increase in operating costs and expenses is primarily the result of increases in wages  benefits  insurance and utilities at our hotels 
rental and other expense for our limited service hotel leases  office properties and one full service hotel that we leased are included in other property level expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
consistent with the relatively fixed nature of these costs  our operating expenses increased in both and despite the decrease in revenues in both years 
corporate and other expenses 
the increase in corporate and other expenses is primarily due to increases in corporate insurance and the appreciation of host marriott s stock price  which affects the employee stock based compensation expense 
interest expense 
interest expense increased over as a result of the payment of aggregate call premiums of million and the acceleration of deferred financing fees of million associated with the prepayment of our senior notes and various mortgages during 
table of contents loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts 
the loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts is due primarily to the approximate million loss from the forward currency exchange contracts for our four canadian hotels being deemed ineffective for hedge accounting purposes 
see liquidity and capital resources debt and effect of financial covenants mortgage debt covenants for further discussion 
minority interest expense 
minority interest expense consists of our minority partners share of the income or loss in consolidated hotel partnerships and the approximate ownership interest in host lp 
the decrease in minority interest expense is due to the decline in our operations discussed above 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates consists of our portion of the earnings losses of two partnerships in which we own non controlling interests and do not consolidate in our financial statements 
the increase in the loss can be attributed to an increase in the net loss of cbm joint venture llc in see investments in affiliates for a discussion of this partnership 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of nine hotels sold in  eight hotels sold in  one hotel sold in  the gain on the disposition and business interruption proceeds for the new york marriott world trade center hotel in and and four properties classified as held for sale as of december  for  the eight hotels sold generated net proceeds of approximately million with a net gain on disposition of approximately million 
discontinued operations for also includes a million gain on the disposition of world trade center hotel 
for and  our revenues for all properties included in discontinued operations were million and million  respectively  and our income before taxes was million and million  respectively 
on december   we announced the settlement of the outstanding matters relating to the terrorist attacks of september  affecting the new york marriott world trade center and financial center hotels with the hotels insurer  marriott international and the port authority of new york and new jersey 
as a result of these settlements  we received net insurance proceeds of approximately million 
as a result of this settlement  we recorded a one time gain of approximately million  which is comprised of approximately million in post business interruption proceeds and approximately million from the disposition of the new york marriott world trade center hotel 
the gain on disposition and the and business interruption income  net of expenses  related to the hotel has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
the business interruption proceeds received  net of expenses  for the new york marriott financial center hotel are included in rooms revenue from continuing operations 
comparable hotel operating statistics we present certain operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues  expenses and adjusted operating profit for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis 
we define our comparable hotels as full service properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results  whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations  for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared  and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared

funds used by hmc to make these distributions are provided from host lp 
because we are required to distribute almost all of our taxable income  we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth  including acquisitions 

table of contents cash balances 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  which was a decrease of million from december  the decrease is primarily attributable to significant debt prepayments and acquisitions in for a further discussion  see sources and uses of cash below 
in the third quarter of  we amended and restated our credit facility  which now provides aggregate revolving loan commitments of million  an increase of million 
we have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
due to the volatile operating environment in and  our cash balances have been in excess of the million to million which we had historically maintained 
with the added flexibility and capacity of our new credit facility and the continuing growth of the economy  we expect to lower our cash balances to previous levels over the next several quarters 
as of december   we also had an additional million of cash which was restricted as a result of lender requirements including reserves for debt service  real estate taxes  insurance  as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits 
the restricted cash balance includes million which is held in escrow in accordance with debt covenant requirements where cash flows after debt service from certain properties did not meet certain required minimum levels see financial condition mortgage debt below 
the restricted cash balances do not have a significant effect on our liquidity 
debt repayments and refinancings 
with the proceeds from asset sales and the insurance proceeds received for the new york marriott world trade center hotel  we repaid or redeemed a total of approximately million of debt in we also made million of scheduled principal payments 
in addition  we refinanced approximately million of our debt in the combined effect of these transactions lowered our average interest rate by approximately basis points 
as a result of the repayments and refinancings completed during both and  our annual interest expense obligations  excluding the effect of call premiums and accelerated deferred financing costs  have declined approximately million based on interest rates as of december  we have no significant debt maturities prior to february  though principal amortization will total approximately million in we believe we have sufficient cash to deal with our near term debt maturities  as well as any unanticipated decline in the cash flow from our business 
reducing our leverage and future interest payments through debt repayments and refinancings remains a key management priority 
in november  host marriott s board of directors authorized us to purchase or retire up to million of our senior notes with proceeds from additional asset sales million of which remains available under this authorization 
senior notes redeemed in connection with a refinancing transaction do not affect the availability under this authorization 
as a result  we may continue to redeem or refinance additional senior notes  our convertible preferred securities quips debt and mortgage debt from time to time to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
we may purchase senior notes and quips debt for cash through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  a tender offer or  in some cases  through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms 
repurchases of debt  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and ffo per diluted share  as defined herein  as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs 
during  we incurred interest expense resulting from the payment of call premiums of approximately million and the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts totaling approximately million 
capital expenditures 
typically  our renewal and replacement capital expenditures range from million to million on an annual basis 
based on the improved economy in  we have increased spending compared to  where we had reduced our capital expenditures based on our assessment of the operating environment  including delaying certain projects due to the start of the war in iraq  and to preserve capital 
for  renewal and replacement capital expenditures totaled approximately million 
during  our capital expenditures were focused on property maintenance and improvements designed to maintain appropriate levels of quality 
we spent approximately million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures in our renewal and replacement capital expenditures are generally funded by the furniture  fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels typically funded annually with approximately of property revenues and by our available cash 

table of contents during  we also spent approximately million on repositioning roi projects 
these projects have historically generated strong returns and over the next several years we expect to spend million to million on such investments 
repositioning roi projects include substantial repositionings or expanding room  ballroom  meeting  conference and exhibit hall facilities often through the conversion of underutilized space  constructing or expanding spa facilities and installing energy management systems 
in addition  we will continue to seek opportunities to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies that capitalize on alternate uses of our assets  such as the development of timeshare or condominium units on excess land or the conversion of existing rooms to timeshare or condominium units such as the previously discussed renovation and repositioning of the newport beach marriott hotel 
the renovation is expected to cost approximately million and will include the addition of a spa and new luxury suites  redesigned guest rooms  a new restaurant concept and updated meeting space 
we also recently announced a commitment to invest approximately million for the development of an exhibit hall for the marriott orlando world center hotel 
in addition  we are pursuing the development of timeshare units on a beachfront parking lot at the hyatt regency maui resort and spa 
on september   we also converted the room denver southeast marriott to the four points by sheraton denver southeast and are currently utilizing rooms 
we spent approximately million in and expect to spend a total of million for the conversion  which we believe will result in improved cash flows 
we are also in the process of negotiating a contract to sell the marriott mountain shadows resort  which has been temporarily closed since september the sale of the hotel is contingent on  among other items  obtaining local government approval for the proposed redevelopment 
acquisitions 
we remain interested in pursuing single asset and portfolio acquisitions and believe that there will be opportunities in the near term and over the next several years to acquire assets that are consistent with our target profile of upper upscale and luxury properties 
an example of this strategy is the july  acquisition of the suite fairmont kea lani maui  a luxury resort hotel located on acres of wailea s polo beach  for million 
we also acquired the suite scottsdale marriott at mcdowell mountains on september  for approximately million  million of which was funded through the assumption of the existing mortgage debt on the hotel and the suite chicago embassy suites downtown lakefront for million in may in addition  during  we purchased a retail building adjacent to one of our hotels and the land under the jw marriott hotel at lenox in atlanta  which we previously leased  for a combined total of approximately million 
we may acquire properties through various structures  including transactions involving portfolios  single assets  joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities 
we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods  including proceeds from equity offerings of hmc  issuance of op units by host lp  advances under our credit facility  our available cash and the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness 
we may  from time to time  be in the process of identifying  analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
we cannot be certain as to the size or timing of acquisition opportunities or of our ability to obtain additional acquisition financing  if needed 
additionally  the number of potential acquirers for individual hotel properties has increased due to the improvement of both the capital markets and the lodging industry and  as a result  the cost of acquiring properties has increased 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to find acquisition targets that provide a suitable return on investment 
sources and uses of cash our principal sources of cash are cash from operations  the sale of assets  borrowing under our credit facility and our ability to obtain additional financing through various capital markets 
our principal uses of cash are debt service  asset acquisitions  capital expenditures  operating costs  corporate and other expenses and distributions to equity holders 

table of contents cash provided by operations 
our cash provided by operations decreased million to million for from million for cash from operations in included million in business interruption proceeds related to the disposition of the new york marriott world trade center hotel

we and marriott international each currently own a interest in cbm joint venture  which owns courtyard by marriott properties totaling approximately  rooms 
as part of the transaction  cbm joint venture will be converted into a limited partnership and we will have the right to cause the partnership to redeem our remaining interest in the partnership under certain conditions between december  and december  starting december   the partnership will have the right to redeem our remaining interest 
the sale is expected to close by march and is subject to several closing conditions  including no significant decrease in the net worth of cbm joint venture but not considering a decrease in net worth due to changes in market conditions  the entering into by cbm joint venture of new management agreements and ground leases with marriott international and its affiliates  sarofim s ability to complete the refinancing of certain secured debt and to obtain certain lender consents  and other customary closing conditions

senior notes general 
the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issues issued by the operating partnership  which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of the operating partnership s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of the operating partnership 
the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  as well as our credit facility  certain other senior debt  and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
restrictive covenants 
under the terms of the senior notes indenture  our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including the achievement of an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of at least x by the operating partnership 
this ratio is calculated in accordance with our senior notes indenture and excludes from interest expense items such as interest on our convertible subordinated debentures  call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  the calculation is based on our pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to the transactions  such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings  as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness excluding our convertible subordinated debentures of less than of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate values and secured indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets 
so long as the operating partnership maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture  we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture  including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition 
our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters  such as limitations on capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  transactions with affiliates and the incurrence of liens 
interest 
we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table below 
exchangeable senior debentures 
on march   we issued million of exchangeable senior debentures and received net proceeds of million  net of underwriting fees and expenses and an original issue discount 
these debentures were issued under our senior notes indenture  and are the only series of senior notes that are exchangeable into hmc common stock 
the exchangeable senior debentures mature on april  and are equal in right of payment with all of our unsubordinated debt 
interest is payable quarterly in arrears on january  april  july and october of each year beginning on april  we can redeem for cash all  or part of  the exchangeable senior debentures at any time subsequent to april  upon days notice at the applicable redemption price as set forth in the indenture 
holders have the right to require us to repurchase the exchangeable senior debentures on april   april  and april  at the issue price 
the exchangeable senior debentures are exchangeable into shares of hmc s common stock at a rate of shares for each  of principal amount of the debentures  or a total of approximately million shares  which is equivalent to an initial exchange price of per share our 
table of contents common stock 
the exchange rate may be adjusted under certain circumstances  including the payment of common dividends 
holders may exchange their exchangeable senior debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions  including at any time at which the closing sale price of our common stock is more than of the exchange price per share  or initially  for at least of trading days 
the exchangeable senior debentures and the common stock issuable upon exchange of the debentures have not been registered under the securities act and may not be offered or sold except to qualified institutional buyers  as defined 
we have a shelf registration statement that is currently effective with respect to the resale of our common stock issuable upon exchange of the debentures 
the following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and maturities related to our senior notes  credit facility and convertible subordinated debentures as of december  in millions balance as of december  thereafter series b senior notes  due series e senior notes  due series g senior notes  due series i senior notes  due series k senior notes  due series l senior notes  due other senior notes exchangeable senior debentures  due total senior notes credit facility  due convertible subordinated debentures  due balances at december  for the series g and series i senior notes include the fair value of interest rate swaps of approximately million and million  respectively 
the interest payments under the series g and series i swaps are based on libor plus and  respectively 
other senior notes consist of two notes with an average interest rate of and mature through and were issued under different indentures than our other senior notes 
convertible subordinated debentures as of december   host marriott financial trust the trust  a wholly owned subsidiary  has million shares of convertible quarterly income preferred securities outstanding the convertible preferred securities  with a liquidation preference of per share for a total liquidation amount of million 
the convertible preferred securities represent an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the trust 
the payment of distributions by the trust  payments on liquidation of the trust  or the redemption of the convertible preferred securities are guaranteed by us 
this guarantee  when taken together with our obligations under the indenture pursuant to which the convertible subordinated debentures due december the convertible subordinated debentures were issued  provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the convertible preferred securities 
proceeds from the issuance of the convertible preferred securities were invested in convertible subordinated debentures issued by hmc 
the trust exists solely to issue the convertible preferred securities and its own common securities and invest the proceeds therefrom in the debentures  which is its sole asset 
the trust is wholly owned and has no independent operations 
each of the convertible preferred securities and the related debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of hmc common stock at the rate of shares per convertible preferred security for a 
table of contents total of approximately million shares equivalent to a conversion price of per share of our common stock 
the trust will only convert convertible subordinated debentures pursuant to a notice of conversion by a holder of convertible preferred securities 
the conversion ratio and price have been adjusted to reflect certain transactions including our conversion to a reit 
during and  no shares were converted to common stock 
holders of the convertible preferred securities are entitled to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of payable quarterly in arrears 
the distribution rate and the distribution and other payment dates for the convertible preferred securities correspond to the interest rate and interest and other payment dates on the convertible subordinated debentures 
we may defer interest payments on the convertible subordinated debentures for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters 
if interest payments on the convertible subordinated debentures are deferred  so too are payments on the convertible preferred securities 
under this circumstance  we will not be permitted to declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to our capital stock or debt securities that rank pari passu with or junior to the convertible subordinated debentures 
the convertible preferred securities are redeemable at the trust s option upon any redemption by us of the convertible subordinated debentures after december  during  the convertible preferred securities can be redeemed at a price equal to of the liquidation preference  or per security 
upon repayment at maturity or as a result of the acceleration of the convertible subordinated debentures upon the occurrence of a default  the convertible preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption 
the convertible preferred securities  as a potentially dilutive security  are evaluated in the calculation of earning per share and ffo per diluted share 
the securities were dilutive for ffo per diluted share for both fourth quarter and  but not for full year 
we believe that the securities will be dilutive in to the extent our ffo per diluted share exceeds approximately 
in connection with the reit conversion  host lp assumed primary liability for repayment of the convertible subordinated debentures underlying the convertible preferred securities 
upon conversion by a convertible preferred securities holder  hmc will issue shares of its common stock  which will be delivered to such holder 
upon the issuance of such shares by hmc  host lp will issue to hmc a number of op units equal to the number of shares of hmc common stock issued in exchange for the convertible subordinated debentures 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of the variable interest entities  we no longer consolidate the trust effective january  as a result  we recognize the million in convertible subordinated debentures issued by the trust as debt  eliminating the million of convertible preferred securities previously classified in the mezzanine section of our balance sheet and recognize  as an equity investment  the million invested in the trust 
additionally  we classify the related dividend payments as interest expense 
credit facility general 
on september   we entered into an amended and restated credit facility 
the credit facility replaces our prior credit facility and provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of million 
the credit facility also includes sub commitments for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million and loans to certain of our canadian subsidiaries in canadian dollars in an aggregate amount of million 
the credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity in september we have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met at the time of the initial scheduled maturity 
we also have the option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders  whether or not currently party to the credit facility  commits to be a lender for such amount 
we have not made any borrowings under the credit facility 
as with the prior facility  the debt under the amended credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and is currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  
table of contents certain other senior debt  and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
as with the prior facility  the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
dual tranche structure 
unlike our prior facility  the revolving loan commitment under the amended credit facility is divided into two separate tranches a revolving facility a tranche of million and a revolving facility b tranche of million 
subject to compliance with the facility s financial covenants  amounts available for borrowing under revolving facility a vary depending on our leverage ratio  with million being available when our leverage ratio is less than x  million being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x but is less than x  million being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x but is less than x  and no amounts being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x 
by contrast  the entire amount of revolving facility b is available for borrowing at any time that our unsecured interest coverage ratio equals or exceeds x and our leverage ratio does not exceed levels ranging from x to x 
specifically  prior to the end of our third quarter of  we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under revolving facility b so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of x  the maximum leverage ratio applicable to revolving facility b is then reduced to x from the end of the third quarter of until the day prior to end of our third quarter of  and is reduced to x thereafter 
financial covenants 
we are subject to different financial covenants depending on whether amounts are borrowed under revolving facility a or revolving facility b  and we are permitted to convert amounts borrowed under either tranche into amounts borrowed under the other tranche 
while the financial covenants applicable under revolving facility a are generally comparable to those contained in our prior facility including covenants for leverage  fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage  the financial covenants applicable to revolving facility b are limited to leverage and unsecured interest coverage  and are set at less restrictive levels than the corresponding covenants applicable to revolving facility a 
as a result of this structure  we have gained flexibility to make and maintain borrowings in circumstances where adverse changes to our financial condition could have prohibited the maintenance of borrowings under the prior facility 
the financial covenants for the revolving facility a and revolving facility b do not apply when there are no borrowings under the respective tranche 
hence  so long as there are no amounts outstanding we are not in default of the credit facility if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the amended credit facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants 
we are in compliance with all our covenants as of december  the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility through facility a financial covenant levels quarter minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio maximum leverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio third quarter to fourth quarter first quarter to fourth quarter facility b financial covenant levels quarter minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio maximum leverage ratio third quarter to fourth quarter first quarter to fourth quarter 
table of contents interest and fees 
we pay interest on borrowings under the revolving facility a at floating interest rates plus a margin which  in the case of libor based borrowings  ranges from to that is set with reference to our leverage ratio 
borrowings under revolving facility b are subject to a margin that is higher than the corresponding margin applicable to revolving facility a borrowings and 
higher when our leverage ratio is greater than x 
as with the prior facility  to the extent that amounts under the amended credit facility remain unused  we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment 
other covenants 
our amended credit facility imposes restrictions on customary matters that were also restricted in our prior facility  such as limitations on capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  the incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends 
while such restrictions are generally similar to those contained in our prior facility  we have modified certain covenants to become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below x 
in particular  at any time that our leverage ratio is below x  we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures  and the limitations on acquisitions  investments and dividends will be replaced by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture 
mortgage debt general 
as of december   we have assets that are secured by mortgage debt 
substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions 
currently  secured debt represents approximately of our total debt and has an average interest rate of and an average maturity of years 
over time  we expect to reduce the amount of our secured debt as a percentage of our total debt 
we may refinance secured debt with other financing alternatives  such as senior notes  although there can be no assurances that we will achieve this objective 
as a result of the decline in operations of our properties in and  restrictive covenants on eight of our hotel properties secured by a million mortgage loan  which we refer to as the cmbs loan  were triggered 
these hotel properties are  the new york marriott marquis  the san francisco airport hyatt regency  the cambridge hyatt regency the reston hyatt regency  the boston hyatt regency  the drake hotel new york  the westin buckhead atlanta  and the swiss tel chicago  which we refer to as the cmbs portfolio 
the cmbs loan contains a provision that requires the mortgage servicer to retain certain excess cash flow from the cmbs portfolio after payment of debt service approximately million if net cash flow after payment of taxes  insurance  ground rent and reserves for furniture  fixtures and equipment for the trailing twelve months declines below million 
this provision was triggered beginning in the third quarter of and will remain in effect until the cmbs portfolio generates the necessary minimum cash flow for two consecutive quarters  at which point  the cash that has been escrowed will be returned to us 
as of december   approximately million of cash has been escrowed 
we do not expect cash flows from the cmbs portfolio to be at the level required to trigger the release of the escrow until therefore  we anticipate that additional cash of million will be escrowed in on july   we modified the terms of the mortgage debt secured by our four canadian properties 
under the terms of this modification  we agreed to escrow the excess cash flow from these hotels on a retroactive basis effective december  in april  approximately million of the cash escrowed in accordance with the loan was applied to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness and approximately million was released to us 
in july  we entered into an agreement with the lenders to further modify certain covenants so that we would not be required to make additional prepayments at that time 
the terms of the modification required us to provide million of cash collateral and pay an additional basis points of interest on the loan 
on december   we made a partial repayment of million 
in conjunction with the repayment  one of the hotels and the million was released from the collateral in on december   we repaid an additional million repayment and an additional hotel was released from the collateral 
there were no amounts escrowed at december  as of december   approximately million was escrowed 
the properties obtained the required level of operations so that the covenant restrictions were lifted and the million escrow will be released in the first quarter of

table of contents credit ratings currently  we have billion of senior notes outstanding and million of hmc preferred stock that are rated by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
standard and poor s rating on our senior debt is b and the rating on hmc s preferred stock is ccc 
moody s has a ba rating on our senior debt and a b rating on hmc s preferred stock 
while we have no senior note maturities until  if our operations or our credit ratios were to decline  the ratings on our securities could be reduced 
if we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings  our cost to issue additional senior notes  either in connection with a refinancing or otherwise  or to issue additional preferred stock would likely increase 
hmc dividend policy hmc is required to distribute to stockholders at least of its taxable income in order to qualify as a reit  including taxable income recognized for tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash 
funds used by hmc to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from host lp 
for every share of common and preferred stock of hmc  host lp has issued to hmc a corresponding common op unit and preferred op unit 
as of february   hmc is the owner of substantially all of the preferred op units and approximately of the common op units 
the remaining of the common op units are held by various third party limited partners 
as a result of the minority position in host lp common op units  these holders share  on a pro rata basis  in amounts being distributed by host lp 
as a general rule  when hmc pays a common or preferred dividend  host lp pays an equivalent per unit distribution on all common or corresponding preferred op units 
for example  if hmc paid a five cent per share dividend on its common stock  it would be based on payment of a five cent per unit distribution by host lp to hmc as well as other common op unit holders 
for these reasons  investors should also take into account the minority position in host lp and the requirement that they share pro rata in distributions from host lp  when analyzing dividend payments by hmc to its stockholders 
hmc s current policy on common dividends is generally to distribute at least of its taxable income  unless otherwise contractually restricted 
hmc currently intends to continue paying dividends on its preferred stock  regardless of the amount of taxable income  unless similarly contractually restricted 
while we are not currently restricted in our ability to pay dividends  during the second half of and through the first quarter of we were limited in our ability to pay dividends  except to the extent necessary to maintain hmc s reit status 
see risk factors our ability to pay dividends may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness for a discussion of those restrictions 
hmc did not pay a dividend on its common stock and  correspondingly  host lp did not pay distributions on its common op units in and as a result of the improvements in operations  on december   we paid a per share dividend on hmc s common stock  representing primarily the final distribution of taxable income 
hmc intends to reinstate a quarterly dividend on hmc s common stock beginning with the first quarter of dividend 
we announced that we believe the first quarter dividend will be approximately 
to 
per share 
the amount of any common distribution will be determined by hmc s board of directors 
investments in affiliates we have made investments in certain ventures which we do not consolidate and  accordingly  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with our accounting policies as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
currently  we and an affiliate of marriott international each own a interest in cbm joint venture  which owns  through two limited partnerships  courtyard by marriott properties totaling  rooms 
the joint venture has approximately  million of assets and million of debt 
this debt consists of approximately million of first mortgage loans secured by of the properties owned by the partnerships  approximately million of senior notes secured by the ownership interest in one partnership and mezzanine debt in the amount of million 
the lender of the mezzanine debt is an affiliate of marriott international 
none of the debt is recourse to  or guaranteed by  us or any of our 
table of contents subsidiaries 
revpar at the partnerships courtyard hotels increased year to date with an average occupancy increase of percentage points and an increase in average room rate of 
we have not received any cash distributions from this partnership since on december   we announced the pending sale of our interest in cbm joint venture see sources and uses of cash for more information 
as described previously  we deconsolidated the trust which issued the convertible preferred securities in accordance with fin r 
this resulted in our recognizing the million in convertible subordinated debentures issued by the trust as debt  eliminating the million of convertible preferred securities previously classified in the mezzanine section of our balance sheet and recognizing  as an equity investment  the million invested in the trust 
additionally  we have classified the related interest payments as interest expense 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we are party to various transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees 
as of december   we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements tax sharing arrangements 
under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international  host marriott services corporation and crestline  we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us 
for example  a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us 
this adjustment could produce a material tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement 
in addition  under the partnership agreement between hmc and host lp  host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties incurred by hmc  as well as any liabilities the irs successfully may assert against hmc 
we do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangement to be material 
tax indemnification agreements 
for reasons relating to tax considerations of the former and current owners of five hotels  we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel 
these agreements require that we indemnify the owners for their tax consequences resulting from our selling the hotel or refinancing the mortgage debt during the period under the agreement 
we have also agreed not to sell more than of the original allocated value attributable to the former owners of a portfolio of additional hotels  or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for income tax purposes 
because the timing of these potential transactions is within our control  we believe that the likelihood of any material indemnification to be remote and therefore not material to our financial statements 
on average  these restrictions will generally expire  or cease to be significant  in guarantees 
we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments 
the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately million as of december  
table of contents in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which owns and operates a senior living facility 
we spun off the partnership as part of crestline in the reit conversion  but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by crestline  who  in turn  is indemnified by the current owner of the facility 
in connection with the sale of three hotels in the fourth quarter of and january  we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately million through the full term of the leases  including renewal options 
we believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote  and in each case  we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel 
information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases and projected capital expenditures  each as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations deferred management fees total the amounts shown include amortization of principal  debt maturities and estimated interest payments 
interest payments have been included in the long term debt obligations based on the weighted average interest rate for both fixed and variable debt 
for variable rate debt  we have used the applicable percentage interest rate as of december  long term debt obligations excludes million of mortgage debt  related to the hartford marriott farmington  that was classified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale at december  the hotel was sold on january  future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants of 
million  payable to us under non cancelable subleases 
the lease payments also include interest payable of million 
future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the hpt subleases of million and million  respectively  payable to us under non cancelable subleases 
our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years and some of the current year amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed 
see capital expenditures 
under terms of our management agreements  we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner s priority to us 
the timing of the payments  if any  is based on future operations  the termination of the management agreement or sale of the hotel and is therefore not determinable 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future 
table of contents uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates impairment testing 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that one or more of our hotels has been impaired  whereby  future undiscounted cash flows for the hotel would be less than the net book value of the hotel 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge when a property s fair value less selling costs is less than its net book value 
we test for impairment in several situations  including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  as well as whenever an asset is classified as held for sale or events or changes in circumstances indicate that a hotel s net book value may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of our hotels  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  holding period  expected useful life future capital expenditures fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
changes in these estimates  assumptions  future changes in economic conditions  or property level results could require us to record additional impairment charges  which would be reflected in operations in the future 
classification of assets as held for sale 
we classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met our board of directors has approved the sale to the extent the dollar magnitude of the sale requires board approval  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed  the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash  and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
to the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property  we will record an impairment loss 
see the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of million  in consolidated deferred tax assets as of december  the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or 
table of contents refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered various factors  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million in deferred tax assets in the future 
when a determination is made that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period 
valuation of foreign currency and derivative contracts 
we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  our interest rate swap agreements with a fair market value of million as of december  have been designated as fair value hedges  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if a particular interest rate swap does not qualify as highly effective  any change in the fair value of the derivative used as a hedge would be reflected in current earnings 
should any change in management strategy  or any other circumstance  cause an existing highly effective hedge to become ineffective  the accumulated loss or gain in the value of the derivative instrument since its inception may be reclassified from the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet to current net income loss 
we also have two interest rate cap agreements that are fair valued each quarter and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss 
we also have several foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we previously used to hedge the mortgage loan on our canadian properties 
the hedge was deemed ineffective for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of accordingly  the change in fair value of these foreign currency forward exchange contracts is recorded in net income loss on the consolidated statements of operations 
see the discussion in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we estimate the fair value of all of these instruments through the use of third party valuations  which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments 
the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves 
the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations 
the fair value of our existing foreign currency and derivatives is likely to fluctuate materially from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity 
consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
currently  we have investments in entities that in the aggregate own hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting 
these entities are considered to be voting interest entities 
the debt on these investments is non recourse to the company and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is not material 
while we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures  if we were required to do so  then all of the results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements 
for further detail on our unconsolidated entities see note to our consolidated financial statements 
application of new accounting standards during november  the financial accounting standards board the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
eitf requires contingently convertible debt instruments to be included in diluted earnings per share  if dilutive  regardless of whether a market price contingency for the conversion of the debt into common shares or any other contingent factor has been met 
prior to this consensus  such instruments were excluded from 
table of contents the calculation of the diluted earnings per share until one or more of the contingencies were met 
eitf is effective for reporting periods ending after december   and does require restatement of prior period earnings per share amounts 
as a result  we will include the common shares that are issuable from the conversion of the exchangeable senior debentures  if dilutive  in our diluted earnings loss per share 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  fas r  which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met  those conditions are much the same as the related conditions in fas the provisions of fas r are effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the adoption of this standard in will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
reporting periods reporting periods for consolidated statement of operations the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers 
our hotel managers use different reporting periods 
marriott international  the manager of the majority of our properties  uses a year ending on the friday closest to december and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its marriott managed hotels 
in contrast  other managers of our hotels  such as hyatt  report results on a monthly basis 
hmc  as a reit  is required by tax laws to report results on a calendar year 
as a result  we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott international modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december to comply with reit rules 
our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott international but our fourth quarter ends on december two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are quarterly start dates will usually differ between years  except for the first quarter which always commences on january  and our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years 
for example  set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for and note that the second and third quarters of and both reflect twelve weeks of operations 
in contrast  the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations 
start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter january march january march january march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september december september december september december  reflects an additional day in february for the leap year 
while the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by the manager of a majority of our properties  one final consequence of our calendar is we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers using a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us 
hence  the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately one fourth of our full service hotels 
as a result  our quarterly 
table of contents results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january  february  second quarter march to may  third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december 
while this does not affect full year results  it does affect the reporting of quarterly results 
reporting periods for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations  our hotel operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and our comparable hotel results are always reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott international for our marriott managed hotels 
this facilitates year to year comparisons  as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year except in the case of fourth quarters comprised of seventeen weeks such as fiscal year versus sixteen weeks 
this means  however  that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results may differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year 
set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for and that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein 
results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations

they are as follows i funds from operations ffo per diluted share  and ii comparable hotel operating results 
the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance 
ffo per diluted share we present ffo per diluted share as a non gaap measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap 
we calculate ffo per diluted share for a given operating period as our ffo defined as set forth below for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities  including the payment of preferred stock dividends  in accordance with nareit guidelines 
we believe that ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of ffo per diluted share  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per 
table of contents share  provides beneficial information to investors 
by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance  we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits  even though ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted by nareit in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
for these reasons  nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we calculate ffo per diluted share  in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance 
in addition  although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits  it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ffo per diluted share presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation  capital expenditures and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
additionally  ffo per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  ffo per diluted share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to stockholders benefit 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of net income loss available to common stockholders per share to ffo per diluted share in millions  except per share amounts reconciliation of net loss available to common stockholders to funds from operations per diluted share year ended december  income loss shares per share amount income loss shares per share amount net loss available to common stockholders adjustments gain on the disposition of the world trade center hotel gain on dispositions  net amortization of deferred gains depreciation and amortization partnership adjustments ffo of minority partners of host lp a adjustments for dilutive securities assuming distribution of common shares granted under the comprehensive stock plan less shares assumed purchased at average market price assuming conversion of convertible subordinated debentures assuming conversion of exchangeable senior debentures b ffo per diluted share c d a represents ffo attributable to the minority interest in host lp 
b eitf  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  became effective in the fourth quarter of and  as a result  the exchangeable senior debentures are now included as a potentially dilutive security 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on eitf c ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit is adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities 
dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans  convertible debt securities  those preferred op units held by minority partners and other minority interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interest to common shares 
no effect is shown for securities if they are anti dilutive

as a result of the new york marriott world trade center hotel insurance settlement in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of approximately million  which is comprised of million in post business interruption proceeds and million from the disposition of the hotel

during  we recognized approximately million of other income from the settlement of a claim that we brought against our directors and officers insurance carriers for reimbursement of defense costs and settlement payments incurred in resolving a series of related actions brought against us and marriott international that arose from the sale of certain limited partnership units to investors prior to the effect on net loss and ffo is approximately million due to income taxes on the proceeds 
represents the portion of the above listed amounts attributable to minority partners in host lp 
comparable hotel operating results we present certain operating results for our full service hotels  such as hotel revenues  expenses  and adjusted operating profit  on a comparable hotel  or same store basis as supplemental information for investors 
our comparable hotel operating results present operating results for full service hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions  significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods 
we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs and expenses related to our capital structure  as well as depreciation and amortization 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management in running our business on a property level basis 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization  because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted earlier  because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization  the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues  expenses  or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts  all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance 
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors  such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions 
while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance  this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels  as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparable hotel operating results  when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit  revenues and expenses  provide useful information to investors and management

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the majority of our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate 
we use some derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract

this debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in interest rates 
we have some financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including our credit facility 
the interest rate on our credit facility is based on a spread over libor  ranging from to 
there were no amounts outstanding on our credit facility at december we expect the proportion of fixed rate debt in our capital structure to range from to of our total debt  although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result on terms acceptable to us 
in furtherance of this objective  we have entered into three interest rate swaps effectively converting million of fixed rate payments to floating rate payments based on a spread to libor 
on december   we entered into a year interest rate swap agreement  which was effective on january  and matures in january  effectively converting our series i senior notes to floating rate 
table of contents debt 
under the swap  we receive fixed rate payments of and pay floating rate payments based on one month libor plus basis points on a million notional amount  which is equal to the current amount of outstanding series i senior notes 
on august   we entered into two four year interest rate swap agreements  which mature october  effectively converting our series g senior notes to floating rate debt 
under the swaps  we receive fixed rate payments of and we make floating rate payments based on six month libor plus basis points on a million notional amount  which is equal to the current amount of outstanding series g senior notes 
we have designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for both financial reporting and tax purposes and the amounts paid or received under the swap agreements will be recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
changes in the fair value of the swap and the series i senior notes and series g senior notes  respectively  are reflected in the balance sheet as offsetting changes and have no income statement effect 
the fair value of the series i interest rate swap at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the series g interest rate swaps at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
these amounts are included in the senior notes line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt and the above swap agreements decrease by basis points  the decrease in interest expense would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
if market rates of interest on the same variable rate debt and swap agreements increase by basis points  the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
exchange rate sensitivity as we have non us operations specifically  the ownership of hotels in canada and mexico  currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business 
to manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non us hotel  where possible  we may enter into forward or option contracts 
the table below summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including foreign currency forward exchange agreements as of december  the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into are strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes 
for foreign currency forward exchange agreements  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
these notional amounts generally are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
expected maturity date total fair value thereafter in millions anticipated transactions and related derivatives foreign currency forward exchange agreements contract amount average contractual exchange rate on august   our canadian subsidiaries entered into a mortgage loan pursuant to which they borrowed million denominated in us dollars at a variable rate of libor plus 
the weighted average interest rate for this mortgage loan was and  respectively  for the years ended december  and in addition  since the mortgage loan on these canadian properties is denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of the canadian subsidiaries is the canadian dollar  the subsidiaries entered into currency forward contracts to hedge the currency exposure of converting canadian dollars to us dollars on a monthly basis to cover debt service payments 
up until april  these forward exchange contracts had been designated as a cash flow hedges of the debt service payments  and the forward contracts were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in december  the company entered into certain transactions which resulted in the forward contracts no longer 
table of contents qualifying as hedges 
we recognized a loss of approximately million in  which was previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
during  we prepaid approximately million of the loan and terminated the foreign currency contracts equal to the prepayments for a payment of approximately million 
accordingly  the change in fair value is recorded in our consolidated statement of operations each period 
for  we recorded a loss of million 
the fair value of the forward contracts was approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and december  in january of  we assigned approximately million notional amount of the forward contracts to a third party for approximately million  which approximated the fair value of those contracts on the date of sale 
after this sale  our outstanding notional amount is approximately million and the fair value of the remaining contracts is approximately million

table of contents risk factors prospective investors should carefully consider  among other factors  the material risks described below 
financial risks and risks of operation we depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessary 
unlike corporations  our ability to reduce our debt and finance our growth largely must be funded by external sources of capital because hmc is required to distribute to its stockholders at least of its taxable income in order to qualify as a reit  including taxable income we recognize for tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash 
our ability to access the external capital we require could be hampered by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control  including declining general market conditions  unfavorable market perception of our growth potential  decreases in our current and estimated future earnings  excessive cash distributions or decreases in the market price of hmc s common stock 
in addition  our ability to access additional capital may also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness  which  among other things  restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of distributions 
the occurrence of any of these above mentioned factors  individually or in combination  could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us or at all and the failure to obtain necessary external capital could have a material adverse affect our ability to finance our future growth 
we have substantial leverage 
as of february   we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately billion 
our substantial indebtedness has important consequences 
it currently requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  expansion efforts  distributions to our partners and other general purposes 
additionally  it could limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or obtain financing for expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general business purposes on terms and conditions acceptable to us  if at all  or affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions 
because hmc must distribute most of its taxable income in order to maintain its qualification as a reit  we depend upon external sources of capital for future growth 
if our cash flow and working capital were not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness  we would have to raise additional funds 
see risk factors we depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessary 
our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry 
the lodging industry experienced a down turn from to  and operations generally declined during this period 
the decline was attributed to a number of factors including a weak economy  the effect of terrorist attacks  terror alerts in the united states and the war in iraq  all of which changed the travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers 
while our operations have improved and revpar increased in  we cannot provide assurance that changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers are permanent or whether they will continue to evolve creating new opportunities or difficulties for the industry 
any forecast we make regarding our results of operations may be affected and can change based on the following risks changes in the national  regional and local economic climate  changes in business and leisure travel patterns  
table of contents local market conditions such as an oversupply of hotel rooms or a reduction in lodging demand  the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to our competition  the performance of the managers of our hotels  changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors  and unionization of the labor force at our hotels 
future terrorist attacks or changes in terror alert levels could adversely affect us 
previous terrorist attacks in the united states and subsequent terrorist alerts have adversely affected the travel and hospitality industries 
the impact which terrorist attacks in the united states or elsewhere could have on our business in particular and the us economy  the global economy and global financial markets in general is indeterminable 
it is possible that such attacks or the threat of such attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business  our ability to finance our business  our ability to insure our properties and on our results of operations and financial condition as a whole 
our expenses may not decrease if our revenue drops 
many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels  such as debt payments  property taxes  insurance  utilities  and employee wages and benefits  are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the hotels 
our expenses will also be affected by inflationary increases  and in the case of certain costs  such as wages  benefits and insurance  may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period 
our managers may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates 
any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures could adversely affect the growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties 
our ground lease payments may increase faster than the revenues we receive on the hotels situated on the leased properties 
as of february   forty of our hotels are subject to third party ground leases encumbering all or a portion of the hotel 
these ground leases generally require increases in ground rent payments every five years 
our ability to service our debt could be adversely affected to the extent that our revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases 
in addition  if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease  the buyer would have to assume the ground lease  which may result in a lower sales price 
we do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels 
because federal income tax laws restrict reits and their subsidiaries from operating a hotel  we do not manage our hotels 
instead  we lease substantially all of our full service properties to subsidiaries which qualify as taxable reit subsidiaries under applicable reit laws  and our taxable reit subsidiaries retain third party managers to manage our hotels pursuant to management agreements 
our income from the hotels may be adversely affected if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they fail to maintain a quality brand name 
while our taxable reit subsidiaries monitor the hotel managers performance  we have limited specific recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately 
in addition  from time to time  we have had  and continue to have  differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements 
we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations 
however  if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations  we may choose to litigate such a dispute 
failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  our hotel managers manage  and in some cases own or have invested in  hotels that compete with our hotels  which may result in conflicts of interest 
as a result  our 
table of contents hotel managers have in the past made and may in the future make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interests 
the terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries  reducing operational flexibility and creating default risks 
the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries 
the activities upon which such restrictions exist include  but are not limited to acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  the incurrence of additional debt  the creation of liens  the sale of assets  capital expenditures  raising capital from the issuance of certain types of mandatorily redeemable capital stock  the payment of dividends  and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  certain covenants in the credit facility require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial performance tests 
the restrictive covenants in the indenture  the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt including our mortgage debt will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest 
our failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt 
our ability to pay dividends may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness 
we are  and may in the future become  parties to agreements and instruments which restrict or prevent the payment of dividends on our classes and series of capital stock 
under the terms of our credit facility and our senior notes indenture  distributions to hmc by host lp  upon which hmc depends in order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends  are permitted only to the extent that  at the time of the distribution  we can satisfy certain financial covenant tests and meet other requirements 
for example  beginning in the third quarter of and continuing through the first quarter of  host lp was prohibited from making distributions other than in the amounts required to permit hmc to pay dividends necessary to maintain reit qualification because our ebitda to interest coverage ratio as calculated under the indenture governing our senior notes which measures the ratio of pro forma consolidated ebitda to pro forma consolidated interest expense was below to during this period  host lp was only able to make distributions to hmc  and hmc was only able to pay dividends  to the extent that we were required to make distributions to maintain hmc s status as a reit 
while our ebitda to interest coverage ratio is currently above to and as a result we are no longer limited by this particular restriction  a decline in our operations could once again limit the amount of distributions that host lp could make  and hmc s ability to pay dividends  either because our ebitda to interest coverage ratio again falls below to or because we fail to meet other financial covenant tests or meet other requirements in our credit facility or senior notes indenture 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may also be limited or prohibited by the terms of our preferred stock and convertible subordinated debentures 
under the terms of each of our outstanding classes of preferred stock  we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock unless cumulative dividends have been paid or funds for payment have been set aside for 
table of contents payment on each such class of preferred stock 
the amount of aggregate dividends that accrue on our outstanding classes of preferred stock each quarter is approximately million 
in the event that we fail to pay the accrued dividends on our preferred stock for any reason  including because we are prevented from paying such dividends under the terms of our debt instruments as discussed above  dividends will continue to accrue on all outstanding classes of our preferred stock and we will be prohibited from paying any dividends on our common stock until all such accrued but unpaid dividends on our preferred stock have been paid or funds for such payment have been set aside 
we may defer interest payments on the convertible subordinated debentures for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters 
if interest payments on the convertible subordinated debentures are deferred  so too are payments on the convertible preferred securities 
under this circumstance  we will not be permitted to declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to our capital stock or debt securities that rank pari passu with or junior to the convertible subordinated debentures 
foreclosure on our mortgage debt could adversely affect our business 
twenty eight of our hotels and assets related thereto are subject to various mortgages in an aggregate amount of approximately billion 
although the debt is generally non recourse to us  if these hotels do not produce adequate cash flow to service the debt secured by such mortgages  the mortgage lenders could foreclose on these assets 
we may opt to allow such foreclosure rather than make the necessary mortgage payments with funds from other sources 
however  our senior notes indenture and credit facility contain cross default provisions  which  depending upon the amount of secured debt defaulted on  could cause a cross default under both of these agreements 
our credit facility  which contains the more restrictive cross default provision as compared to our senior notes indenture  provides that it is a credit facility default in the event we default on non recourse secured indebtedness in excess of of our total assets using undepreciated real estate values or default on other indebtedness in excess of million 
for this and other reasons  permitting a foreclosure could adversely affect our long term business prospects 
our mortgage debt contains provisions that may reduce our liquidity 
certain of our mortgage debt requires that  to the extent cash flow from the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels  we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels 
in some cases  the escrowed amount may be applied to the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt 
when such provisions are triggered  there can be no assurance that the affected properties will achieve the minimum cash flow levels required to trigger a release of any escrowed funds 
the amounts required to be escrowed may be material and may negatively affect our liquidity by limiting our access to cash flow after debt service from these mortgaged properties 
rating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capital 
both our senior notes and our preferred stock are rated by moody s and standard poor s 
these independent rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our senior notes and our preferred stock at any time 
these downgrades negatively affect our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital 
our management agreements could impair the sale or financing of our hotels 
under the terms of our management agreements  we generally may not sell  lease or otherwise transfer the hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions 
our ability to finance or sell our properties  depending upon the structure of such transactions  may require the manager s consent 
if  in these circumstances  the manager does not consent  we may be precluded from taking actions in our best interest without breaching the management agreement 

table of contents the acquisition contracts relating to some hotels limit our ability to sell or refinance those hotels 
for reasons relating to tax considerations of the former and current owners of seven hotels  we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel 
we have also agreed not to sell more than of the original allocated value attributable to the former owners of a portfolio of additional hotels  or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for income tax purposes 
we anticipate that  in specified circumstances  we may agree to similar restrictions in connection with future hotel acquisitions 
as a result  even if it were in our best interests to sell these hotels or repay or otherwise reduce the level of the mortgage debt on such hotels  it may be difficult or costly to do so during their respective lock out periods 
we may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are illiquid 
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions 
the inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service our debt 
in addition  there are limitations under the federal tax laws applicable to reits that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets 
applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities 
as a reit we are subject to various restrictions on our income  assets and activities 
business activities that could be impacted by applicable reit laws include  but are not limited to  activities such as developing alternative uses of real estate  including the development and or sale of timeshare or condominium units  investments in real estate mortgages  investments in securities and dispositions of certain properties 
due to these restrictions  certain business activities  including those mentioned above  may need to occur in one or more of our taxable reit subsidiaries 
our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as corporations and are subject to federal  state  and  if applicable  local and foreign taxation on their income at applicable corporate rates 
in addition  under reit laws  the aggregate value of all of our taxable reit subsidiaries may not exceed of the value of all of the reit s assets 
we depend on our key personnel 
our success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers 
we cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance 
litigation judgments or settlements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are a party to various lawsuits 
while we and the other defendants to such lawsuits believe all of the lawsuits in which we are a defendant are without merit and we are vigorously defending against such claims  we can give no assurance as to the outcome of any of the lawsuits 
if any of the lawsuits were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur  there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business  liquidity  financial position and or results of operations 
as part of our business strategy  we seek to acquire upper upscale and luxury hotel properties 
we may acquire these properties through various structures  including transactions involving portfolios  single assets  
table of contents joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities 
we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods  including proceeds from equity offerings of hmc  issuance of limited partnership interests in host lp  advances under our credit facility  and the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness 
we may  from time to time  be in the process of identifying  analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate 
our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms  or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions  could have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity  financial position and or results of operations  including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities 
we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts 
instead of purchasing hotel properties directly  we may invest as a co venturer 
co venturers often share control over the operation of a joint venture 
for example  we entered into a joint venture with marriott international that owns two limited partnerships holding  in the aggregate  courtyard by marriott hotels 
subsidiaries of marriott international manage these courtyard by marriott hotels and other subsidiaries of marriott international serve as ground lessors and mezzanine lender to the partnerships 
actions by a co venturer could subject the assets to additional risk  including our co venturer in an investment might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our  or the joint venture s  interests or goals  our co venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives  or our co venturer could go bankrupt  leaving us liable for its share of joint venture liabilities 
although we generally will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture to permit our objectives to be achieved  we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners 
also  our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent 
environmental problems are possible and can be costly 
we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws 
unidentified environmental liabilities could arise  however  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance 
federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property 
the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants 
even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination  each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred 
in addition  third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos 
these laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos  that they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 

table of contents compliance with other government regulations can be costly 
our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation  including title iii of the americans with disabilities act  building codes and regulations pertaining to fire safety 
compliance with those laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures 
these regulations may be changed from time to time  or new regulations adopted  resulting in additional costs of compliance  including potential litigation 
any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
some potential losses are not covered by insurance 
we carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability  property  business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties 
these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar type properties 
generally  our all risk property policies provide coverage that is available on a per occurrence basis and that  for each occurrence  has an overall limit as well as various sub limits on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive 
sub limits exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption  abatement  earthquakes  expediting costs or landscaping replacement  and the dollar amounts of these sub limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit 
our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub limits contained in our policies have been exceeded and  in the case of four of our hotels where the manager provides this coverage  any such claims will also be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the managers program for the same purpose 
that means that  if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels  or  in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the management company  affects hotels owned by others  the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub limits  depending on the type of claim  have been reached and each affected hotel may only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available 
we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and  as a result  we may be even less likely to receive sufficient coverage for risks that affect multiple properties such as earthquakes or certain types of terrorism 
in addition  there are other risks such as war  certain forms of terrorism such as nuclear  biological or chemical terrorism and some environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or may be too expensive to justify insuring against 
if any such risk were to materialize and materially adversely affect one or more of our properties  we would likely not be able to recover our losses 
we may also encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy 
should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier  we could lose all  or a portion of  the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts  and federal terrorism legislation does not ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future 
we obtain terrorism insurance as part of our all risk property insurance program 
however  as noted above  our all risk policies have limitations such as per occurrence limits and sublimits which might have to be shared proportionally across participating hotels under certain loss scenarios 
also  all risk insurers only have to provide terrorism coverage to the extent mandated by the terrorism risk insurance act tria for certified acts of terrorism namely those which are committed on behalf of non united states persons or interests 
furthermore  we do not have full replacement coverage at all of our properties for acts of terrorism committed on behalf of united states persons or interests noncertified events as our coverage for such incidents is subject to 
table of contents sublimits and annual aggregate limits 
in addition  property damage related to war and to nuclear  biological and chemical incidents is excluded under our policies 
while tria will reimburse insurers for losses resulting from nuclear  biological and chemical perils  tria does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and  to date  insurers are not willing to provide this coverage  even with government reinsurance 
in addition  tria terminates on december   and there is no guarantee that the terrorism coverage that it mandates will be readily available or affordable thereafter 
as a result of the above  there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the extent and adequacy of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of future terrorist attacks that impact our properties 
risks of ownership of hmc s common stock there are limitations on the acquisition of hmc common stock and changes in control 
hmc s charter and bylaws  the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  hmc s stockholder rights plan and the maryland general corporation law contain a number of provisions  the exercise of which could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or op unit holders or otherwise be in their best interests  including the following restrictions on ownership and transfer of hmc s stock 
to maintain hmc s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  not more than in value of hmc s outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals  as defined in the internal revenue code to include some entities 
in addition  a person who owns  directly or by attribution  or more of an interest in a tenant of ours  or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner  cannot own  directly or by attribution  or more of hmc s shares without jeopardizing hmc s qualification as a reit 
unless exempted by hmc s board of directors  hmc s charter prohibits ownership  directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code  by any person or persons acting as a group  of more than in value or number  whichever is more restrictive  of shares of hmc s outstanding common stock  preferred stock or any other stock  each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose 
together  these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit 
stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary  and the person who acquired the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon  to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale 
a transfer of shares of hmc s stock to a person who  as a result of the transfer  violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances  and  in any event  would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of hmc s stock in excess of the ownership limit 
these restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit 
removal of board of directors 
hmc s charter provides that  except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock  directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast for the election of directors 
vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by the concurring vote of a majority of the remaining directors except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors must be filled by a majority vote of the entire board of directors and  in the case of a vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders  by at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors 
preferred shares  classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval 
hmc s charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that we have authority to issue is  initially consisting of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock 
the board of directors has the authority  without a vote of stockholders  to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock  including common stock into 
table of contents preferred stock or vice versa  and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred or other class or series of shares to be issued 
because the board of directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of additional classes or series of stock without a stockholder vote  hmc s board of directors may give the holders of any class or series of stock preferences  powers and rights  including voting rights  senior to the rights of holders of existing stock 
consent rights of the limited partners 
under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  we generally will be able to merge or consolidate with another entity with the consent of partners holding limited percentage interests that are more than of the aggregate percentage interests of the outstanding limited partnership interests entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation  including any limited partnership interests held by us  as long as the holders of limited partnership interests either receive or have the right to receive the same consideration as hmc s stockholders 
hmc  as holder of a majority of the limited partnership interests  would be able to control the vote 
under hmc s charter  holders of at least two thirds of hmc s outstanding shares of common stock generally must approve a merger or consolidation 
maryland business combination law 
under the maryland general corporation law  specified business combinations  including specified issuances of equity securities  between a maryland corporation and any person who owns or more of the voting power of the corporation s then outstanding shares  or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who at any time during the two year period prior to the date in question owned or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the corporation each  an interested stockholder  or an affiliate of the interested stockholder  are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
thereafter  any of these specified business combinations must be approved by of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding voting shares and by two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of voting shares other than voting shares held by an interested stockholder unless  among other conditions  the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price  as defined in the maryland general corporation law  for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder 
hmc is subject to the maryland business combination statute 
maryland control share acquisition law 
under the maryland general corporation law  control shares acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding shares owned by the acquiror  by officers or by directors who are employees of the corporation 
control shares are voting shares which  if aggregated with all other voting shares previously acquired by the acquiror or over which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy  would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power one tenth or more but less than one third  one third or more but less than a majority or a majority or more of the voting power 
control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval 
a control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares  subject to specified exceptions 
hmc is subject to these control share provisions of maryland law 
merger  consolidation  share exchange and transfer of hmc s assets 
pursuant to hmc s charter  subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock  we can merge with or into another entity  consolidate with one or more other entities  participate in a share exchange or transfer hmc s assets within the meaning of the maryland general corporation law if approved by hmc s board of directors in the manner provided in the maryland general corporation law and by hmc s stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  except that any merger of us with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing hmc s form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of hmc s stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger 
under the maryland general corporation law  specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange is only required to be approved by a 
table of contents maryland corporation by its board of directors if the corporation is the successor 
hmc s voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
certain charter and bylaw amendments 
hmc s charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transferability of hmc s stock  fixing the size of the board of directors within the range set forth in the charter  removal of directors and the filling of vacancies  all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors and approved by hmc s stockholders holding two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
any amendments of these provisions of the charter setting forth the necessary approval requirements also would require action of the board of directors and the approval by stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
as permitted under the maryland general corporation law  hmc s bylaws provide that directors have the exclusive right to amend hmc s bylaws 
these provisions may make it more difficult to amend hmc s charter and bylaws to alter the provisions described herein that could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of hmc common stock  without the approval of the board of directors 
stockholder rights plan 
we adopted a stockholder rights plan which provides  among other things  that when specified events occur  hmc s stockholders  other than an acquiring person  will be entitled to purchase from us a newly created class or series of junior preferred stock  subject to hmc s ownership limits described above 
the preferred stock purchase rights are triggered by the earlier to occur of ten days after the date of a public announcement that a person or group acting in concert has acquired  or obtained the right to acquire  beneficial ownership of or more of hmc s outstanding shares of common stock or ten business days after the commencement of or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer  the consummation of which would result in the acquiring person becoming the beneficial owner of or more of hmc s outstanding common stock 
the exercise of the preferred share purchase rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by hmc s board of directors 
shares of hmc s common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of hmc s common stock  or the perception that sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for hmc s common stock 
in addition  holders of units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership  whose op units are redeemed by the operating partnership in exchange for common stock  will be able to sell those shares freely  unless the person is our affiliate and resale of the affiliate s shares is not covered by an effective registration statement 
further  a substantial number of shares of hmc s common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans  including shares of common stock reserved for options  or pursuant to securities we may issue that are convertible into shares of hmc common stock or securities other than op units that the operating partnership has issued that are exchangeable for shares of our common stock 
as of february   i there are approximately million op units outstanding that are redeemable  and ii there are outstanding million aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior debentures of the operating partnership exchangeable under certain conditions for shares of hmc common stock at an initial exchange price equivalent to per share for a total of approximately million shares subject to adjustment for various reasons  including as a result of the payment of dividends to common stockholders iii there are outstanding million of convertible preferred securities issued by the host marriott reit financial trust that are convertible into shares of hmc common stock at a conversion price equivalent to per share for a total of approximately million shares 
moreover  additional shares of common stock issued by hmc would be available in the future for sale in the public markets 
we can make no prediction about the effect that future sales of common stock would have on the market price of hmc common stock 
our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of hmc s common stock 
we believe that the market value of a reit s equity securities is based primarily upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions  whether from 
table of contents operations  sales  acquisitions  development or refinancings  and is secondarily based upon the value of the underlying assets 
for that reason  shares of hmc s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share 
to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes  working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders  these retained funds  while increasing the value of our underlying assets  may negatively impact the market price of hmc s common stock 
our failure to meet the market s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of hmc s common stock 
market interest rates may affect the price of shares of hmc s common stock 
we believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a reit is the distribution rate on the shares  considered as a percentage of the price of the shares  relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher distribution rate 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of hmc s shares to go down 
federal income tax risks the lower tax rate on certain dividends from regular c corporations may cause investors to hold stock in those corporations 
while corporate dividends have traditionally been taxed at ordinary income rates  dividends received by individuals through december  from regular c corporations generally will be taxed at the maximum capital gains tax rate of as opposed to the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 
reit dividends are not eligible for the lower capital gains rates  except in certain circumstances where the dividends are attributable to income that has been subject to corporate level tax 
this difference in the taxation of dividends could cause individual investors to view the stock of regular c corporations as more attractive relative to the stock of reits 
individual investors could hold this view because the dividends from regular c corporations will generally be taxed at a lower rate while dividends from reits will generally be taxed at the same rate as the individual s other ordinary income 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  this difference in the taxation of dividends may have on the value of the stock of reits  either in terms of price or relative to other potential investments 
to qualify as a reit  hmc is required to distribute at least of its taxable income  irrespective of its available cash or outstanding obligations 
to continue to qualify as a reit  hmc currently is required to distribute to its stockholders with respect to each year at least of its taxable income  excluding net capital gain 
in addition  it will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions made by it with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of of its ordinary income and of its capital gain net income for that year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods less excess distributions from prior years 
hmc intends to make distributions  subject to the availability of cash and in compliance with any debt covenants  to its stockholders to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from the operating partnership 
however  there are differences in timing between hmc s recognition of taxable income and its receipt of cash available for distribution due to  among other things  the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be phantom income  which is taxable income that is not matched by cash flow to us 
due to some transactions entered into in years prior to the reit conversion  hmc could recognize substantial amounts of phantom income 
it is possible that these timing differences could require us to borrow funds or to issue additional equity to enable hmc to meet the distribution requirement and  therefore  to maintain its reit status  and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax 
in addition  because the reit distribution requirement prevents hmc from retaining earnings  we will generally be required to refinance debt that matures with additional debt or equity 
we cannot assure you that any of the sources of funds  if available at all  would be sufficient to meet hmc s distribution and tax obligations 

table of contents adverse tax consequences would apply if hmc failed to qualify as a reit 
we believe that hmc has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  commencing with its taxable year beginning january   and hmc currently intends to continue to operate as a reit during future years 
no assurance can be provided  however  that hmc qualifies as a reit or that new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to its qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification 
if hmc fails to qualify as a reit  and any available relief provisions do not apply  it will not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing its taxable income  and it will be subject to federal and state income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
in addition  unless entitled to statutory relief  it would not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification is lost 
any determination that hmc does not qualify as a reit would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce the value of our common stock materially 
the additional tax liability to us for the year  or years  in which hmc did not qualify would reduce our net earnings available for investment  debt service or distributions to our stockholders 
furthermore  hmc would no longer be required to make any distributions to stockholders as a condition to reit qualification and all of our distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of hmc s current and accumulated earnings and profits  or e p 
this means that stockholders taxed as individuals currently would be taxed on those dividends at capital gains rates and corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends  subject in each case  to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code 
hmc s failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under our credit facility that could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due under the credit facility  which  in turn  would constitute an event of default under our outstanding debt securities 
new legislation  enacted october   contained several provisions applicable to reits  including provisions that could provide relief in the event hmc violates certain provisions of the internal revenue code that otherwise would result in its failure to qualify as a reit 
we cannot assure you that these relief provisions would apply if hmc failed to comply with the reit qualification laws 
even if the relief provisions do apply  hmc would be subject to a penalty tax of at least  for each disqualifying event in most cases 
hmc will be disqualified as a reit at least for taxable year if it failed to distribute all of its e p attributable to its non reit taxable years 
in order to qualify as a reit  hmc cannot have at the end of any taxable year any undistributed e p that is attributable to one of its non reit taxable years 
a reit has until the close of its first taxable year as a reit in which it has non reit e p to distribute its accumulated e p 
hmc was required to have distributed this e p prior to the end of  the first taxable year for which its reit election was effective 
if it failed to do this  it will be disqualified as a reit at least for taxable year we believe that distributions of non reit e p that hmc made were sufficient to distribute all of the non reit e p as of december   but we cannot provide assurance that we met this requirement 
if our leases are not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes  hmc would fail to qualify as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  hmc must satisfy two gross income tests  under which specified percentages of its gross income must be passive income  like rent 
for the rent paid pursuant to the leases  which constitutes substantially all of our gross income  to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests  the leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts  joint ventures or some other type of arrangement 
in addition  the lessees must not be regarded as related party tenants  as defined in the internal revenue code 
we believe that the leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will agree with this view 
we also believe that crestline  the lessee of substantially all of our full service hotels prior to january   was not a related party 
table of contents tenant and  as a result of changes in the tax laws effective january   our affiliated lessee will not be treated as a related party tenant so long as it qualifies as a taxable reit subsidiary 
if the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes or if the lessee was regarded as a related party tenant  hmc would not be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to reits and it would lose its reit status 
see risk factors federal income tax risks adverse tax consequences would apply if hmc failed to qualify as a reit above 
if our affiliated lessee fails to qualify as a taxable reit subsidiary  hmc would fail to qualify as a reit 
for our taxable years beginning on and after january   we are permitted to lease our hotels to a subsidiary of the operating partnership that is taxable as a corporation and that elects to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary 
so long as any affiliated lessee qualifies as a taxable reit subsidiary of ours  it will not be treated as related party tenant 
we believe that our affiliated lessee qualifies to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes 
we cannot assure you  however  that the irs will not challenge its status as a taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes  or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in disqualifying our affiliated lessee from treatment as a taxable reit subsidiary  hmc would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to reits and substantially all of its income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests and  accordingly  hmc would cease to qualify as a reit 
see risk factors federal income tax risks adverse tax consequences would apply if hmc failed to qualify as a reit above 
despite hmc s reit status  we remain subject to various taxes  including substantial deferred and contingent tax liabilities 
notwithstanding hmc s status as a reit  we are subject to certain federal  state  local and foreign taxes on our income and property 
in addition  hmc will be required to pay federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate upon its share of any built in gain recognized as a result of any sale before january   by the operating partnership of assets  including the hotels  in which interests were acquired by the operating partnership from our predecessor and its subsidiaries as part of the reit conversion 
built in gain is the amount by which an asset s fair market value exceeded our adjusted basis in the asset on january   the first day of hmc s first taxable year as a reit 
the total amount of gain on which hmc would be subject to corporate income tax if the assets that we held at the time of the reit conversion were sold in a taxable transaction prior to january  would be material to us 
in addition  at the time of the reit conversion  we expected that hmc or rockledge hotel properties  inc or fernwood hotel assets  inc  or rockledge and fernwood  respectively each of which is a taxable corporation in which the operating partnership owned a nonvoting interest and  as of april   acquired of the voting interests and each of which  elected to be a taxable reit subsidiary effective january   likely would recognize substantial built in gain and deferred tax liabilities in the next ten years without any corresponding receipt of cash 
hmc may have to pay certain state income taxes because not all states treat reits the same as they are treated for federal income tax purposes 
we may also have to pay certain foreign taxes to the extent we own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions 
the operating partnership is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes and any related interest and penalties incurred by hmc  as well as any liabilities that the irs or the tax authorities successfully may assert against hmc for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time it qualified as a reit 
our taxable reit subsidiaries  including rockledge and fernwood  are taxable as corporations and will pay federal  state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates  and foreign taxes to the extent they own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions 
if the irs were to challenge successfully the operating partnership s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  hmc would cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences 
we believe that the operating partnership qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
as a partnership  it is not subject to federal income tax on its income 
instead  each of its partners  
table of contents including hmc  is required to pay tax on its allocable share of the operating partnership s income 
no assurance can be provided  however  that the irs will not challenge its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for tax purposes  hmc would fail to meet the income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and  accordingly  cease to qualify as a reit 
if the operating partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or hmc fails to qualify as a reit  either failure would cause an event of default under our credit facility that  in turn  could constitute an event of default under our outstanding debt securities 
also  the failure of the operating partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax  which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners  including hmc 
finally  the classification of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause hmc to recognize gain at least equal to our negative capital account  if any 
as a reit  hmc is subject to limitations on its ownership of debt and equity securities 
subject to certain exceptions a reit is generally prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer to the extent that the value of those securities exceeds of the value of the reit s total assets or the securities owned by the reit represent more than of the issuer s outstanding voting securities or more than of the value of the issuer s outstanding securities 
a reit is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the value test and the vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a taxable reit subsidiary 
however  a reit may not own securities of taxable reit subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than of the value of the reit s total assets 
our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to special rules that may result in increased taxes 
several internal revenue code provisions ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that it receives if the economic arrangements between the reit and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
hmc may be required to pay a penalty tax upon the sale of a hotel 
the federal income tax provisions applicable to reits provide that any gain realized by a reit on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a penalty tax 
under existing law  whether property  including hotels  is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction 
we intend that we will hold the hotels for investment with a view to long term appreciation  to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels as are consistent with our investment objectives 
we cannot assure you  however  that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales is subject to the penalty tax
