item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations in march  a special committee of independent directors was organized to evaluate a potential combination with a private company in a related line of business 
no assurance can be given that such transaction will be completed 
during  our  loss from operations was principally the result of the  write off of the company s investment in sefl net income of reflects  in an after tax gain resulting from the sale of use canada and  generated from the payment for ownership interest in illinois based generating project entities previously sold to ajg 
results of operations comparison of  and a summary of the components of operating income follows dollars in thousands revenues    operating expenses    general and administritive expenses    depreciation and amortization    investment write off   gain from joint ventures income loss from operations    in comparing fiscal information it should be noted that the company sold its investment in use geothermal on june  and was deemed a discontinued operation in the company s investment in sefl was reduced to in the th quarter of the company s interest was sold in see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
effective december   use canada was deemed to be a discontinued operation in connection with its anticipated sale to the countryside fund 
the sale was completed on april  see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
useb acquired its subordinated debt owed to ajg financial services on september  which resulted in a  pre tax gain in ajg financial services  inc satisfied its obligation to pay for the remaining ownership in certain illinois gencos which resulted in a  pre tax gain in the second quarter of the useb readville cogeneration project was closed effective october  due to the termination of the contract with the energy user 
investments in joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  and accordingly  revenues and expenses of these investments are not included in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenues the company s revenues were  compared with  for and  for the decrease of  or  from to was primarily due to a the closing of a useb project in due to a contract termination  b a decrease in useb revenue due to changes in net rates received for energy sales  offset partially by in increased volume of energy sales  c the elimination of other revenues related to useb operations that were offset by operating expenses  and d the elimination of sefl management fees 
the  decrease in revenues in from to was due primarily to the deconsolidation of sefl in the financial statements for in  revenues from sefl were  expenses operating expenses the company s operating expenses were  compared with  in and  in the  or  decrease in was the result of the elimination of useb operating expenses that were offset by a decrease in useb revenues as indicated above  a decrease in useb project operating expenses due to the termination of a project contract  and a general reduction in useb operating expenses  
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in primarily due to the inclusion  in  of a  fee associated with the termination of a contract for a useb project 
the  or  decrease in operating expenses in when compared to was primarily due to the deconsolidation of sefl and recording of use canada and geothermal as discontinued operations 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in due to the reduction in the number of useb full time employees resulting from the outsourcing of project operating and maintenance expenses and the implementation of cost reduction strategies 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for were  a decrease of  or  compared with the expenses for decreased by  or when compared with general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and for  and respectively 
the following table summarizes general and administrative expenses for  and general and administrative expenses salaries  other compensation and consulting    legal and professional insurance corporate expenses other  countryside fund expense reimbursement  total    for  general and administrative expenses included the reimbursement from the countryside fund of  for expenses incurred by the company related to the countryside fund transaction 
this reimbursement was utilized in part to offset the increase in additional compensation awarded to employees generally pursuant to existing employment arrangements and bonus plans 
the  or  decrease in general and administrative expense in when compared with was due primarily to the inclusion in of previously deferred compensation of  the payment of severence and consulting fees related to the consolidation of the accounting and administrative functions of the company of  an increase in the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable of  the expensing of in development costs previously capitalized and the inclusion of applicable to us enviro systems  which was sold in  offset in part by the reserve for sefl management fees of depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were  in compared with  for  an increase of or 
the increase was due to an increase in the amoritzation of debt issuance costs associated with the the countryside fund transaction 
amortization costs for subsequent years will be approximately higher than those reported in due to the fact that the amount recorded in does not reflect full year s amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the countryside fund transaction which closed on april  the  or  decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses in was primarily due to the sale of us enviro systems in interest and dividend income interest and dividend income for was  an increase of  or  compared with  for the increase in interest income is primarily from the interest earned on the  purchase note bearing a interest rate delivered by ajg financial services in payment of the balance of the purchase price owed in connection with the acquisition of ownership interests in certain of the illinois based generating project entities that it acquired from useb 
see note g to the consolidatd financial statements the  or  decrease in interest income in when compared to was due to a reduction in the amount of interest related to the installment sale of partnership interests 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease is the result of the reduction in payments on the notes due to the expiration of the production of section tax credits for a number of the useb projects 
interest income for the installment sales was in compared with in the balance of the reduction was reflective of lower market rates resulting in lower interest earnings on investments 
interest expense interest expense for was  an increase of  or  when compared to the  in interest expense reported for this increase is the result of the increase in total amount of non related party debt outstanding as of december  to  from the december  amount of  and the increase in the interest rate on the debt to from an average interest rate of as of december  the changes in the total outstanding debt and the interest rate resulted from the countryside fund transaction that closed on april  interest expense for years subsequent to will be higher than in due to the fact that the amount recorded in does not reflect the full year of increased interest rates and increased debt outstanding resulting from the countryside fund transaction 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements 
the  or  decrease in interest expense in when compared with was primarily the result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt and the continued amortization of principal on the outstanding debt 
unrealized gain loss the unrealized gain for is comprised of  of mark to market gains in open trading positions from the investment of the illinois accounts and in gains associated with foreign currancy exchange rates less taxes of income tax provision for income taxes resulted in a tax benefit for  and of   and  respectively 
the company has a net operating loss nol carry forward of approximately  some of which is subject to limitation under section of the irs code 
transaction costs in  we incurred transaction costs of  associated with the countryside fund 
these costs include  in debt prepayment fees paid to john hancock and abb energy capital due to the prepayment of the debt prior to its maturity   related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance cost associated with john hancok and abb energy capital debt and  for internal company expenses associated with the transaction 
other income loss in we had other income loss of  this income was comprised of a  pre tax gain associated with the acquisition of the ajg subordinated debt plus in earnings on the investment of reserve funds 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
dollars in thousands total less than years years more than year years debt obligations      operating leases purchase obligations  other long term liabilities    total      footnotes the company is a party to contractual obligations including gas purchase agreements and operation and maintenance agreements which do not specifically provide for a minimum purchase obligation and accordingly are not included above 
in  we paid an aggregate of  pursuant to such arrangements 
other long term liabilities reflected on registrants balance sheet according to gaap 
on the balance sheet  this is titled illinois subsidy liability 
the  reported on the balance sheet is equal to  owed to illinios under the retail rate program less  related to the gaap treatment of the subsidy 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and marketable securities totaled  of which  was unrestricted  as compared with  of unrestricted cash at december  the financing arrangements between the countryside fund and the useb projects require these subsidiaries to maintain various restricted cash accounts  which  at december   amounted to  included in the cash and marketable securities is  that is managed by a money manager under investment allocation parameters established by the company and useb 
the investment accounts managed by the money manager  as of december  included  invested in equity funds   invested in debt funds and  being held in cash or cash equivalents 
the cost basis of the investments  which have been invested with the money manager since july  is during the year ended december  net cash flows provided by operating  financing activities and investing activities resulted in an increase in cash and marketable securities of  during the year  cash flow utilized by operating activities was  which is a decrease of  from the  of cash provided by operating activities for the decrease is the result of the loss of operating cash flow from the sale of use canada and the termination of the sefl investment plus additional interest paid by useb as the result of the the countryside fund transaction 
cash flows from investing activities was  for  an increase of  from the amounts reported for the increase was due to the sale of use canada 
cash flow from financing activities was  for  an increase of  when compared to the amount from the increase is primarily the result of refinancing of the useb debt with the countryside fund and the sale of the useb roayalty interest to the countryside fund 
useb s financing arrangements with the countryside fund limit the ability of useb and its subsidiaries to distribute funds to the company or to make improvements or expand certain projects unless specified conditions are satisfied 
we continue to evaluate current and forecasted cash flow as a basis to determine financing operating requirements and capital expenditures 
we believe that we have sufficient cash flow from operations and working capital including unrestricted cash on hand to satisfy all obligations under outstanding indebtedness  to finance anticipated capital expenditures and to fund working capital requirements during the next twelve months 
significant accounting estimates the company utilized estimates in the calculation of the valuation of the goodwill asset 
see note a to the consoidated financial statements 
actual future operating results that deviate from the estimates would have an effect on the future valuation of the goodwill asset 
certain risk factors that may impact us set forth below and elsewhere in this report and other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks related to the company our subsidiaries have substantial indebtedness and in connection with their existing indebtedness we have agreed to significant restrictions upon their operations  including their ability to use their cash 
we have substantial debt that has been incurred to finance the acquisition and development of energy facilities 
as of december   our total consolidated long term debt was  the terms of this debt require useb to deposit per calender quarter into the debt service reserve fund provided that cash available  as defined in the loan agreement  is at certain levels 
useb was only required to make of additional deposits into the debt service reserve during until an amount is deposited into the reserve equal to per quarter since the april  closing  useb is precluded from making dividend or royalty payments or from expending funds to expand its production capacity 
whether useb will be able to meet our debt service obligations and fund the debt service reserve obligations will depend primarily upon the performance of its energy projects 
we have rate risk within the illinois retail rate program 
during  useb experienced major rate reductions at three of the illinois projects operating under the illinois retail rate program 
the off taker at such projects is commonwealth edison 
retail rates for these projects  which are adjusted annually in arrears  decreased by amounts ranging from to per kwh 
projects participating in this program accounted for and of our revenues in and  respectively 
useb cannot predict whether any other rate changes are likely 
any additional rate decreases will have a negative effect on our operating results and cash flow 
we depend on our electricity and landfill gas customers 
our energy facilities rely on one or more energy sales agreements with one or more customers for a substantial portion of their revenues 
any material failure by any customer to fulfill its obligations under an energy sales agreement could have a negative effect on the cash flow available to us and on our results of operations 
commonwealth edison accounted for and of our revenues in and  respectively 
our business of owning  operating power plants  and district energy systems involve considerable risk 
the operation of energy generation facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of power generation  heating and cooling  equipment  transmission lines  pipes or other equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
although the facilities in which we are or will be involved contain some redundancies and back up mechanisms  no assurances can be made that those redundancies or back up mechanisms would allow the affected facility to perform under applicable power purchase and energy sale agreements 
useb has entered into operation and maintenance agreements with ge jenbacher and run energy for eight and two of its projects  respectively 
as a result  useb is and will be dependent on these third party operators for the successful operation of these projects 
to the extent that these parties do not fulfill their obligations under these agreements  useb s operations at these projects could be adversely affected 
renewable energy projects such as geothermal  biogas and biomass projects are dependent upon energy and fuel supplies  which may experience significant changes 
our energy projects  particularly our district energy systems  experience changes in revenue and expenses due to seasonality 
we may lose our status as a qualifying facility 
if any of our projects were to lose its status as a qf  then it could become subject to rate and other regulation as a public utility under the federal and state law 
this would result in substantial regulatory burdens  and possibly insurmountable impediments  to affected entities with regard to conducting business in the manner currently conducted and contemplated 
in addition  loss of qf status could trigger defaults under covenants to maintain qf status in various purchase and loan agreements and result in termination  penalties or acceleration of indebtedness under such agreements  plus interest 
a facility may lose its qf status on a retroactive or a prospective basis 
while certain legislation to repeal and amend certain sections of purpa  which had been pending before the united states senate and the united states house of representatives  would have protected each existing contract of qfs from a repeal of the obligation of electric utilities to purchase from qfs under their existing ppas  there is no guarantee that any future legislation  as passed into law  would contain provisions to grandfather such ppas 
loss of qf status for any biogas project could lead to  among other things  a requirement that the biogas project refund payments previously made under the ppas  with interest 
under the fpa  ferc has exclusive rate making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electric energy and the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce 
these rates may be determined on either a cost of service basis or  if the applicable standards are met  using a market based approach 
if any biogas project were to lose its qf status  the rates set forth in the applicable ppa would have to be filed with ferc and would be subject to initial and potentially subsequent reviews by ferc under the fpa  which could result in reductions to such rates 
loss of qf status by any illinois based biogas project would cause it also to lose its qswef status 
see business regulation 
a significant source of us biogas revenues are generated from special tax credits provided for the sale of landfill gas to third parties and these credits will expire 
useb benefits from section of the internal revenue code 
section provides that owners of biogas facilities that collect and sell biogas as a fuel are permitted to reduce their annual federal income tax liability with a tax credit based upon the volume of the biogas sold to unrelated third parties 
historically useb has sold interests in the gascos producing these tax credits to financial investors and such sales have provided useb with additional revenue 
part of the purchase price is contingent on gas production 
if gas production were to fall  useb s revenues may decline 
useb has agreed to indemnify the financial investors that have purchased interests in the gascos for certain losses suffered by such investors in the event that the section tax credits are denied in certain circumstances 
the tax credit is available for biogas produced at projects that had existing gas collection facilities that were placed in service before july  the tax credits are available for qualifying projects until december   except that projects which were in operation prior to qualified for the tax credits only through therefore the universe of projects eligible for tax credits is limited 
from time to time  legislation has been proposed to renew section tax credits  but it is uncertain whether this legislation will be enacted  what its final form will be  and in particular whether such legislation would extend section tax credits for existing projects or make them available only for new projects 
the unavailability of these tax credits for future biogas projects may make such future projects less attractive for investment 
the expiration of these tax credits for existing projects may make some biogas projects financially unviable and reduce useb s revenues 
neither useb  any of the gascos  nor any gasco partner has received a ruling from the irs confirming that the biogas facilities of the gascos meet the requirements of section  that the sales of interests in the gascos by useb were structured in a way that would entitle the buyers to section credits  or that sales of methane from the gascos to the gencos or transcos generate section credits 
while a ruling is not required  as is the case with any section transaction in which a ruling is not obtained  the irs may challenge the availability of section credits to any of the gascos or to its partners 
we may be unable to acquire or renew the numerous permits and approvals required to operate power facilities 
the construction and operation of energy projects require numerous permits and approvals from governmental agencies  as well as compliance with environmental laws and other regulations 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and that each of our projects has the requisite approvals  our projects require compliance with a varied and complex body of laws and regulations that both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce 
there can be no assurance that new laws or amendments to existing laws which would have a materially adverse affect will not be adopted  nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to obtain all necessary permits and approvals for proposed projects or that completed facilities will comply with all applicable permit conditions  statutes and regulations 
in addition  regulatory compliance for the construction of new facilities is a costly and time consuming process which may necessitate substantial expenditures to obtain permits  and may create a significant risk of expensive delays or loss of value if a project is unable to function as planned due to changing requirements or local opposition 
we have legislative risk pertaining to the continuation of the illinois retail rate program ten of the illinois project owned by our useb subsidiary operate under the illinois retail rate program 
under the program  the illinois commerce commission mandates that the local utility purchase power from our projects at above market rates 
the utility is reimbursed by illinois for any payments made to our projects above market rates or avoided costs 
from time to time during the past few years and in each of and  the governor and or lieutenant governor of illinois and members of the illinois legislature have proposed changes to or the elimination of the illinois retail rate program and have introduced legislation to such effect 
while legislation has not been adopted  the adoption of legislation or the implementation of rules that would reduce or eliminate the benefits received by the company under this program would have a material adverse effect on the company  as the revenues from such projects constitued of our revenues in we may face substantial impediments to completing future acquisitions and development projects 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to identify and acquire appropriate companies or energy projects  our ability to develop new energy projects  our ability to integrate the acquired and developed operations effectively and our ability to increase our market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify viable acquisition candidates or development projects  that any identified candidates or development projects will be acquired or developed  that acquired companies or power facilities and developed projects will be effectively integrated to realize expected efficiencies and economies of scale  or that any acquisitions or development projects will prove to be profitable or be without unforeseen liabilities 
in the event that acquisition candidates or development projects are not identifiable or acquisitions or development projects are prohibitively costly  we may be forced to alter our future growth strategy 
as we continue to pursue our acquisition and development strategy in the future  our stock price  financial condition and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we have limited available capital  and we may need additional financing in the future 
we believe that our current and anticipated cash flow from operations and assets sales from the financing sources and transactions described herein will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months  however  there can be no assurance in this regard 
as of december  we had  in unrestricted cash available 
if we are unable to generate cash flows from operations to fund our working capital needs  we would be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing to continue to operate our business 
in addition  we anticipate that each project we acquire or develop will require us to raise additional financing  some of which may be in the form of additional equity 
there can be no assurance that this capital will be available to us  or if available  that it will be on terms acceptable to us 
if issuing equity securities raises additional funds  significant dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if additional financing for projects is not available on acceptable terms  we may have to cancel  decline or defer new projects 
any inability by us to obtain additional financing to meet cash or capital requirements  if required  may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
environmental health and safety risks our projects are regulated by numerous and significant laws  including statutes  regulations  by laws  guidelines  policies  directives and other requirements governing or relating to  among other things air emissions  discharges into water  the storage  handling  use  transportation and distribution of dangerous goods and hazardous and residual materials  such as chemicals  the prevention of releases of contaminants  pollutants or hazardous materials into the environment  the presence  remediation and monitoring of contaminants  pollutants or hazardous materials in soil and water  including surface or groundwater  both on and off site  land use and zoning matters  and workers health and safety matters 
as such  the operation of the projects and systems carry an inherent risk of environmental  health and safety liabilities including potential civil actions  compliance or remediation orders  fines and other penalties  and may result in the projects and systems being involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings relating to such matters  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
our projects have obtained environmental permits that are required for their operation 
although we believe that the operations of the facilities are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental laws  including permits required for the operation of the projects and systems and although there are environmental monitoring and reporting systems in place with respect to all the projects and systems  there is no guarantee that more stringent laws will not be imposed  that there will not be more stringent enforcement of applicable laws or that such systems may not fail  which may result in material expenditures 
failure by the projects and systems to comply with any environmental  health or safety requirements  or increases in the cost of such compliance  including as a result of unanticipated liabilities whether as a result of newly discovered issues or known issues that have not been quantified or expenditures for investigation  assessment  remediation or monitoring  could result in additional expense  capital expenditures  restrictions and delays in the projects and systems activities  the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may be material 
resource availability and constancy the biogas projects rely on the extraction of biogas from public and privately owned landfill sites 
the decomposition of waste causes the release of methane gas  carbon dioxide  and other gaseous material into the ground and atmosphere 
landfills typically can emit biogas for more than years 
landfills generally produce biogas in increasing volumes during their initial years of operation and for several years after they are closed 
then the biogas volume gradually declines over ensuing years 
therefore each project is likely to produce less revenue after the first years following the landfill closing  and may over time become unprofitable as the volume of biogas continues to decline 
thus in many cases it is not profitable to maintain projects more than a certain number of years following the closing of the related landfill 
the quantity of available biogas is determined by numerous factors including  without limitation  filling pattern of the landfill  the composition of the waste  compaction  moisture content  time and climatic conditions 
these factors are beyond the control of useb 
further  they constitute future events that cannot be predicted with certainty 
in the event that the amount of biogas produced by a landfill is less than expected  the methane component of the gas is less than expected or the duration of biogas emission is shorter than expected  the sale of biogas by useb  the production of electricity by useb and or the amount of revenue received by useb from the sale of section tax credits may be adversely affected in a material manner 
generally with respect to each biogas project i the gasco s right to extract biogas from the landfill is subject to a long term gas rights agreement with the landfill owner  ii the genco or transco s right to purchase biogas from the gasco is subject to a long term gas purchase agreement with the gasco  and iii the genco or transco s right to occupy the landfill is subject to a long term lease with the landfill owner 
in certain cases  based on the occurrence of certain events  including an event of default by the gasco  genco or transco the contract counterparty may terminate the applicable agreement or lease prior to the expiry of its term 
while useb believes that the biogas projects  gascos  gencos and transco s are in material compliance with all of their respective agreements or leases  if one of the foregoing agreements or leases was terminated prematurely  for any reason  the relevant biogas project would be affected in a material adverse manner 
qswef status all of useb s illinois based biogas projects qualify as qswefs and therefore benefit from the rate incentive program 
the rate incentive program permits such qswefs to sell electricity that they generate to public utilities in whose service areas the qswefs are located at a rate that during the period of the rate incentive program a is equal to the average amount per kwh paid by the local governmental entities for electricity with certain exceptions in such qswefs respective jurisdictions and b typically exceeds the public utilities respective avoided costs 
eligibility for the rate incentive program is based on compliance with the requirements contained in the illinois public utility act  regulations promulgated by the icc icc regulations and the icc orders issued by the icc respecting qswefs 
a qswef would lose all or some of the benefits provided by the rate incentive program if it were found to be in non compliance with these requirements 
similarly  a qswef may lose all or some of such benefits in the event of modifications to the illinois public utility act  the icc regulations  the icc orders or icc policies or repeal of the illinois public utility act 
in such event  the revenues and profits from the affected qswefs may be materially adversely impacted 
the rate incentive received by each qswef  which must be reimbursed to illinois  represents the excess of the gross contract rate received by such qswef from the public utility less the public utility s avoided cost 
therefore  the qswef s rate incentive and corresponding reimbursement obligation will depend  among other things  on the level of such avoided cost  which is beyond the control of the qswef 
loss of qswef status could trigger defaults under covenants to maintain qswef status in various purchase and loan agreements including the loans agreements with countryside fund and result in termination  penalties or acceleration of indebtedness under such agreements plus interest 
illinois subsidy liability repayment the icc has broad powers to enforce and interpret the provisions of the illinois public utility act  icc regulations and icc orders 
in the future  the icc may promulgate new regulations and establish new policies or modify existing regulations and policies 
such actions  if taken and upheld by the courts  may have a materially adverse impact on some or all of the illinois based biogas projects 
the icc has enforcement authority to direct each owner of an illinois based biogas project to satisfy its subsidy liability repayment obligations  which authority may extend to  among other matters  the legal entity that is to hold the illinois accounts  the amount of funds to be deposited annually in the illinois accounts and the kinds of investments in which such funds are or may be invested 
although the icc has considered imposing and has imposed such requirements in the past as a condition to its approval of certain proposed transactions  it cannot be predicted with certainty whether and under what similar or different circumstances the icc may attempt to impose any of such requirements in the future 
however  provided the qswefs a remain in compliance in good faith with the current illinois public utilities act  icc regulations and icc orders  b make timely deposits to their illinois accounts that  together with earnings thereon from a reasonable and balanced investment portfolio  are reasonably sufficient to meet the qswefs reimbursement obligations to the illnois  and c do not seek approval from the icc for any transactions that require icc approval or modify existing icc orders  the we have no reason to believe that the icc will take any such actions respecting the qswefs in a manner materially adverse to them 
under the illinois retail rate program  each qswef must begin to repay the subsidy it has received to illinois beginning no later that the earlier of the date the qswef has paid or otherwise satisfied in full the capital costs or indebtedness incurred in developing its facility and years after the date its facility commenced commercial operation  with such repayment to be completed no later than the earlier of years after such date of commencement of commercial operation and the end of its facility s actual useful life 
in order to meet this obligation  each qswef has established an illinois account in which it has deposited and will continue to deposit a portion of the subsidy as it is received with the expectation that such deposits  when invested prudently in a balanced portfolio managed by professional advisors  will over time generate sufficient earnings to permit such qswef to meet its reimbursement obligations to illnois as and when they come due 
however  in the event the icc exercised its enforcement authority in a manner that resulted in a lower return than expected or the investments in the illinois accounts otherwise do not generate the expected earnings  a qswef may not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations to reimburse the illnois when such obligations come due with potential material adverse consequences to the affected qswef 
future foreign currency exchange risk pursuant to the terms of the financing arrangements with the countryside fund  useb is required to make debt service payments to the countryside fund in canadian dollars 
useb has entered into a three year hedge agreement with a financial institution fixing the us dollar to the canadian dollar exchange rate at approximately us per canadian dollar through march  beginning april   useb is required to maintain a foreign currency hedge agreement for a minimum of of the remaining debt service payments 
useb will be at risk for fluctuations in the currency exchange rate should the rate vary from the exchange rate existing in the expiring hedge agreement and no new hedge agreement is in place 
the energy business is very competitive and increased competition could adversely affect us 
in addition to competition from electric utilities in the markets where our projects are located  our energy business also faces competition from companies currently involved in the cogeneration and independent power market throughout the united states 
some of these companies are larger and better financed than we are 
although we believe that we will be entering segments of the marketplace where we will not face extensive competition  no assurances can be made that we will be able to enter these markets or that there will not be competition in such markets 
additionally  in recent years  such competition has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices in certain markets 
while a majority of the off takers of our projects are contractually obligated to purchase electricity under long term power ppas  the projects based on market pricing will be exposed to fluctuations in the wholesale price of electricity 
in addition  should any of the long term contracts terminate or expire  we will be required to either negotiate new ppas or sell into the wholesale market for electricity  in which case the prices for electricity will depend on market conditions at the time 
similarly  when the biogas projects located in illinois are no longer eligible to receive incentives under the rate incentive program  it is expected that the projects will seek to negotiate new contracts in the green power market based on rates prevailing in the green power market at the time 
further  the gross contract rate which useb s illinois based biogas projects receive is equal to the average amount per kwh paid by the local government entities in the project s respective jurisdiction and  therefore  may be subject to change 
we operate in an emerging industry and have limited marketing capabilities 
although the energy markets in which we operate have been in existence for a number of years  they are still in the development stage 
as is typically the case in an emerging industry  levels of demand and market acceptance for products and services are highly uncertain 
further  we have limited financial  personnel and other resources to undertake extensive marketing activities 
we may experience project development risks 
our ability to develop new projects is dependent on a number of factors outside our control  including obtaining customer contracts  power agreements  governmental permits and approvals  fuel supply and transportation agreements  electrical transmission agreements  site agreements and construction contracts 
no assurances can be made that we will be successful in obtaining these agreements  permits  and appraisals 
project development involves significant environmental  engineering and construction risks 
although we have insurance it may not cover every potential risk associated with our operations 
although we maintain insurance of various types to cover many of the risks that apply to our operations  including  of general liability insurance  a  umbrella policy  as well as separate insurance for each project  our insurance will not cover every potential risk associated with our operations 
the occurrence of a significant adverse event  the risks of which are not fully covered by insurance  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk fluctuations in interest rates and investment yields will effect earnings derived from the investment of the various reserve accounts which could have a material effect on the company s financial performance 
fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar as it relates to the payment of debt service on the the countryside fund loan could also have a material effect on the company s financial performance 
the exchange rate is currently fixed per a foreign currency hedge agreement that expires in march  see notes a and e to our consolidated financial statements
