item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements contained herein are not based on historical facts and are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements which are based on various assumptions some of which are beyond the corporation s control  may be identified by reference to a future period or periods  or by the use of forward looking terminology  such as may  will  believe  expect  estimate  anticipate  continue  or similar terms or variations on those terms  or the negative of these terms 
actual results could differ materially from those set forth in forward looking statements  due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  those related to the economic environment  particularly in the market areas in which the company operates  competitive products and pricing  fiscal and monetary policies of the us government  changes in government regulations affecting financial institutions  including regulatory fees and capital requirements  changes in prevailing interest rates  acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses  credit risk management  asset liability management  the financial and securities markets and the availability of and costs associated with sources of liquidity 
critical accounting policies the bank s allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is an estimate that is based on assumptions that are highly uncertain  and if different assumptions were used or if any of the assumptions used were to change  there could be a material impact on the presentation of the corporation s financial condition 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  collateral values and the effect of economic conditions on the financial condition of the borrowers 
to determine the allowance for loan losses  the bank estimates losses on all loans that are not classified as substandard or doubtful by applying historical loss rates to those loans in accordance with sfas in addition  all loans that are classified as substandard or doubtful and any loans that are nonaccrual or renegotiated are individually tested for impairment 
any amount of monetary impairment is included in the allowance for loan losses in accordance with sfas substandard  doubtful  nonaccrual  or renegotiated loans that do not have any monetary impairment identified are assigned an allowance following the same method as unclassified loans 
management is of the opinion that the allowance for loan losses of  as of december  was adequate 
assets acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at the lower of fair value or the loan carrying amount at the date of foreclosure 
subsequent to foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
results of operations net income increased in to million as the economy continued to gain strength and the fed began to raise managed interest rates 
net interest income increased million as the average earning assets increased million and the net interest margin increased from to 
during  net loans increased million  or  and deposits increased million  or 
the bank also increased its longer term federal home loan bank borrowings and repurchase agreements while reducing its overnight federal funds borrowed 
the most significant improvement in the earnings was due to the decrease of million  or in the provision for loan losses 
this decrease was due to the exceptionally large provision recorded in non interest income decreased slightly in as securities gains and mortgage origination fees both declined as rates began to rise 
excluding these two items  non interest income increased  or compared to non interest expenses increased million  or  primarily due to increases in compensation and occupancy expenses related to the bank s expansion efforts into the downriver area of southern wayne county 
as a result of the above  income before the provision for income taxes increased million  or 
the percentage of the bank s income that is generated by tax exempt securities and bank owned life insurance decreased in  causing the effective tax rate to increase from in to 
the increase in income before taxes and the increase in the effective tax rate resulted in an increase of million or in the provision for income taxes 
net income increased million  or to million 
in  the deterioration of some large credit relationships led to a million addition to the allowance for loan losses 
this caused net income to decrease million  or  compared to although average earning assets increased million  the net interest margin decreased ten basis points 
as a result  the net interest income increased only  equity markets began to recover late in  but the low market values for most of the year caused our income from trust services to decline  or 
we were able to increase our deposit account service charges in while remaining one of the lowest cost providers of deposit services in our market  our fee income increased by  or 
in  we increased our investment in bank owned life insurance resulting in an increase of  or in the earnings on these policies 
total non interest income increased  or 
non interest expenses increased as we continued our expansion into the southern wayne county market 
during we opened two full service branches and we increased our total staffing from to these changes contributed to the increase of million  or in our non interest expenses 
income before provision for income taxes decreased million  or compared to the lower amount of income resulted in a decrease of million  or in our provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate decreased from in to in net income decreased slightly in as we encountered continued low interest rates and a sluggish national and local economy 
net income decreased  or less than  compared to while deposits and total assets each increased  net loans decreased 
commercial and industrial loans decreased and loans to individuals for household  family  and other personal expenditures decreased while real estate loans showed a slight increase of 
the decrease in loans was partially attributable to the transfer of million of loans to other real estate and charge offs of million  which enabled us to reduce our allowance for loan losses  income before provision for income taxes decreased million  or  compared to a larger percentage of our income was in interest on obligations of states and political subdivisions in  resulting in a decrease of  or in our provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate decreased from in to in earnings for the bank are usually highly reflective of the net interest income 
in the federal open market committee of the federal reserve raised the fed funds rate for the first time since as the economy continued to grow 
during the year  the fed funds target rate was increased five times  from to 
in spite of these increases  rates on new and renewing loans were still below the average rates in the loan portfolio 
as a result  the average yield on loans decreased from to 
investment yields did improve slightly and the cost of funds decreased  resulting in an increase in the net interest margin and net interest income 
in  rates remained low  with the fed lowering the managed rates basis points in june 
this caused refinance activity to continue  and the bank s yield on loans declined from to 
market rates also were low  and the investment yield dropped from to in during the year  the bank restructured its portfolio of federal home loan bank advances  converting million  or of its portfolio  from fixed rate to floating rate 
this lowered the cost of these borrowings from in and to in in  market interest rates remained at historically low levels  prompting many borrowers to refinance their existing debt 
the low interest rate environment also resulted in an increase in the amount of investment securities called 
these factors lead to a decrease in the yield on earning assets from in to in total interest income decreased million while total interest expense decreased only million  resulting in a decrease of million in net interest income 
the provision for loan losses decreased million after a large increase in other income increased million as service charges on deposit accounts increased due to an overdraft program started late in and gains on the sales of investment securities also increased 
non interest expenses increased compared to salaries and employee benefits increased as the bank continued to add staff  particularly in the loan  credit analysis  and loan review areas 
this additional staff will allow the bank to provide better customer service to existing customers  resume the growth in the loan portfolio  and improve the monitoring of existing credit relationships

the following table shows the maturities or repricing opportunities whichever is earlier for the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the repricing assumptions shown are consistent with those established by the bank s asset and liability management committee alco 
savings accounts and regular now accounts are non maturing  variable rate deposits  which may reprice as often as daily  but are not included in the zero to six month category because in actual practice  these deposits are only repriced if there is a large change in market interest rates 
the effect of including these accounts in the zero to six month category is depicted in a subsequent table

since the fed began removing accommodation in the second half of  longer term market rates have decreased 
this flattening of the yield curve presents a challenge for us  as the yields on our fixed rate assets are influenced by the longer term market rates while the cost of many of our liabilities is influenced by shorter term rates 
this condition will make it difficult for us to increase our net interest margin  and if it persists  we may experience a decrease in our margin 
recovery in our region  which lags behind other areas due to the connection to the automotive industry  is slowly gaining strength 
we expect local loan demand comparable to that which we experienced in  with total loans increasing between five and ten percent 
we opened a new full service branch and regional center in wyandotte  michigan in this is our fourth branch in southern wayne county  a market which is expected to contribute to our projected increases in loans and deposits in this growth is expected to produce an increase in net interest income 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses provides adequate coverage for the losses in our portfolio  and we expect that we will be able to maintain the adequacy of the allowance without a significant increase in the provision for loan losses 
we anticipate that slower mortgage refinance activity and less gains on the sales of investment securities will result in a small increase in non interest income 
expenses related to our additional offices and staffing increases will cause non interest expenses to increase 
primarily due to the anticipated increase in net interest income  we expect net income to increase slightly in the following table shows the loan portfolio for the last five years

to serve as a basis for making this provision  the bank maintains an extensive credit risk monitoring process that considers several factors including current economic conditions affecting the bank s customers  the payment performance of individual loans and pools of homogeneous loans  portfolio seasoning  changes in collateral values  and detailed reviews of specific loan relationships 
for loans deemed to be impaired due to an expectation that all contractual payments will probably not be received  impairment is measured by comparing the bank s recorded investment in the loan to the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral  or the loan s observable market price

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank faces market risk to the extent that the fair values of its financial instruments are affected by changes in interest rates 
the bank does not face market risk due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity prices 
the asset and liability management process of the bank seeks to monitor and manage the amount of interest rate risk 
this is accomplished by analyzing the differences in repricing opportunities for assets and liabilities gap analysis  as shown in item  by simulating operating results under varying interest rate scenarios  and by estimating the change in the net present value of the bank s assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes 
each month  the asset and liability committee alco  which includes the senior management of the bank  estimates the effect of interest rate changes on the projected net interest income of the bank 
the sensitivity of the bank s net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured by using a computer based simulation model to estimate the impact on earnings of a gradual increase or decrease of basis points in the prime rate 
the net interest income projections are compared to a base case projection  which assumes no changes in interest rates

throughout  the estimated variability of the net interest income was within the bank s established policy limits 
the alco also monitors interest rate risk by estimating the effect of changes in interest rates on the economic value of the bank s equity each month 
the actual economic value of the bank s equity is first determined by subtracting the fair value of the bank s liabilities from the fair value of the bank s assets 
the fair values are determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards number  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the bank estimates the interest rate risk by calculating the effect of market interest rate shocks on the economic value of its equity 
for this analysis  the bank assumes immediate increases or decreases of and basis points in the prime lending rate 
the discount rates used to determine the present values of the loans and deposits  as well as the prepayment rates for the loans  are based on management s expectations of the effect of the rate shock on the market for loans and deposits
