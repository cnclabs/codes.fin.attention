item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview landauer is a leading provider of analytical services to determine occupational and environmental radiation exposure 
for over years  the company has provided complete radiation dosimetry services to hospitals  medical and dental offices  universities  national laboratories  and other industries in which radiation poses a potential threat to employees 
landauer s services include the manufacture of various types of radiation detection monitors  the distribution and collection of the monitors to and from clients  and the analysis and reporting of exposure findings 
these services are provided to approximately million individuals in the us  japan  france  the united kingdom  brazil  canada  china  australia and other countries 
substantially all of the company s revenues are realized from radiation monitoring services and other services incidental to radiation dose measurement 
the company enters into agreements with customers to provide them with radiation monitoring services  generally for a twelve month period  these agreements generally have a high degree of renewal 
relationships with customers are generally stable and recurring  and the company provides customers with on going services 
as part of its services  the company provides its customers with radiation detection badges that are produced and owned by the company 
the badges are worn for a period selected by the customers wear period  generally one  two  or three months in duration 
at the end of the wear period  the badges are returned to the company for analysis 
the company analyzes the badges that have been worn and provides its customers with a report indicating radiation exposures 
the company recycles certain badge components for reuse  while also producing replacement badges on a continual basis 
additional reporting and other radiation measurement and management services ancillary services are provided to customers at their option 
landauer s inlight dosimetry system  introduced in late fiscal  provides smaller in house and commercial laboratories the ability to offer a complete radiation monitoring service 
the system is based on the company s propriety osl technology and instruments and dosimetry devices developed by matsushita industrial equipment company  and allows customers the flexibility to tailor their precise dosimetry needs 
inlight services may involve a customer acquiring or leasing dosimetry detectors and reading equipment from the company 
landauer s operations include services for the measurement and monitoring of radon gas referred to as sales of radon kits and services related to the remediation of radon gas  which require the customer to deploy a radon detector and return the detector to the company s laboratories for dose determination and reporting 
where a customer has purchased a radon services agreement  the company may assist with remediation services on properties where radon measurements exceed a specified threshold 
combined inlight and radon related products and services currently represent less than of consolidated revenues 
landauer operates a mature business  and growth in numbers of customers is modest 
in recent years  the company s strategy has been to expand into new international markets  primarily by partnering with existing dosimetry service providers with a prominent local presence 
in addition  the company has been developing new platforms and formats for its osl technology  such as inlight  to gain access to markets where the company previously did not have a significant presence  such as smaller in house and commercial laboratories 
revenue growth in recent years has occurred as a result of increased prices for certain services  entry into new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions  modest unit growth  and new ancillary services and products 
the services provided by the company to its customers are ongoing and of a subscription nature 
as such  revenues are recognized in the periods in which such services are rendered  irrespective of whether invoiced in advance or in arrears 
given the subscription nature of landauer s services  quarterly revenues are fairly consistent 
during the second quarter of each fiscal year  however  the company provides additional services of reporting annual radiation dose summaries that generate increased revenues 
the introduction of the company s inlight product line may result in some variability in quarter to quarter revenue comparisons  given the nature of purchase cycles associated with sales of radiation dose measurement instruments and detectors

critical accounting policies the sec issued statements regarding disclosure by companies within their management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in those statements  the sec encouraged companies to identify critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue the services provided by the company to its customers are of a subscription nature and are continuous 
the company views its business as services provided to customers over a period of time and the wear period is the period over which those services are provided 
badge production  wearing of badges  badge analysis  and report preparation are integral to the benefit that the company provides to its customers 
these services are provided to customers on an agreed upon recurring basis monthly  bi monthly or quarterly that the customer chooses for the wear period 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  adjusted for changes in pricing and volume  over the wear period as the service is continuous and no other discernible pattern of recognition is evident 
revenues are recognized over the periods in which the customers wear the badges irrespective of whether invoiced in advance or in arrears 
the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheet represent customer deposits invoiced in advance during the preceding twelve months for services rendered over the succeeding twelve months  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to  and  respectively  as of september  and september  management believes that the amount of deferred revenue shown at the respective consolidated balance sheet dates fairly represents the level of business activity it expects to conduct with customers invoiced under this arrangement 
property  plant equipment plant and equipment including dosimetry badges and software are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily years for buildings and three to eight years for equipment 
landauer assesses the carrying value of its property  plant and equipment and the remaining useful lives whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors that could trigger this review include competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
landauer capitalizes  as a component of equipment  internal software costs in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and such costs amounted to   and  respectively  for fiscal years  and goodwill and other intangible assets the company s intangible assets are comprised of goodwill  purchased customer lists  licenses and patents 
on october   the company adopted sfas no 
which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer be amortized to earnings  but be reviewed periodically for impairment 
for acquisitions completed prior to june   the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets ceased beginning in fiscal year under sfas  the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized must be based generally on fair values 
as a result of applying the impairment provisions of sfas no 
 no impairment loss was required 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years 
other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
such review is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and an assessment of fair value based on discounted cash flows or other indicators of fair market value 
employee benefit plans in the united states  landauer maintains a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all full time employees and a supplemental key executive retirement plan that provides for certain retirement benefits payable to key officers and managers 
while charges for the supplemental plan are expensed annually  the plan is not separately funded 
the company maintains a directors retirement plan that provides for certain retirement benefits payable to non employee directors 
the directors plan was terminated in additionally  the company maintains an unfunded retiree medical expense reimbursement plan 
the pension expenses and benefit obligations recorded for these plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest costs  expected compensation increases  benefits earned  mortality rates  and other factors 
if actual results are significantly different than those forecasted or if future changes are made to these assumptions  the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly 
the weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine the fiscal pension expense included the following discount rate of  unchanged from prior year  expected return on plan assets of  unchanged from prior year  and rate of compensation increase of  slightly lower than fiscal the weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at september  were a discount rate of  lower than the fiscal rate of  and a rate of compensation increase of  slightly lower than the rate for fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the financial statements of the company s non us subsidiaries are remeasured into non us dollars using the us dollar as the functional currency 
to date  the market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates has not been material in relation to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
these risks could increase  however  as the company expands in international markets 
the company does not have any significant trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable  or commitments in a currency other than that of the reporting unit s functional currency 
a adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact to our financial condition and reported results of operations would decline by approximately  as such  the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure in its non us operations or for trading or speculative purposes 
the company seeks to manage its exposure to adverse interest rate changes through its normal operations and does not use any derivative financial instruments to manage such exposure 
the company uses a line of credit to provide for a portion of its financing needs 
at september   the balance outstanding under this arrangement was  interest costs would increase by approximately  for each percentage point increase in the rate of interest on this credit facility assuming current balances
