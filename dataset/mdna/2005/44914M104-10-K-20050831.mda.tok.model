item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
proprietary rights and licenses we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we currently have a number of patents relating to our products  including eight united states patents  three foreign patents  and a number of patent applications pending in the united states and abroad 
there can be no assurance that our patents will not be invalidated  circumvented  or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us  or that any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged by applicable governmental patent examiners  will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  there can be 
table of contents no assurance that other companies will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents owned by us 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  our business  operating results  and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we rely upon certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with our internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  any such software licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent software could be developed  identified  licensed  and integrated  which would materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we distribute our products under software license agreements that grant customers a nonexclusive  nontransferable license to use our products and contain terms and conditions prohibiting the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our products 
generally  we do not provide end users with the source code for our products except under escrow arrangements 
generally  such agreements provide that such parties will have a limited  nonexclusive right to use such code in the event that there is an undismissed bankruptcy proceeding by or against us  if we cease to do business  or if we materially fail to meet our contractual obligations

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from licensing our software products and providing maintenance  consulting  and training services 
our standard software license agreement is a perpetual license to use our products on an end user  concurrent user  or central processing unit basis 

table of contents we record revenue from licensing our software products to end users provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of the product has occurred  as prescribed by statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
for arrangements with multiple elements  and for which vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized for the delivered elements based upon the residual method in accordance with sop  modifications of sop with respect to certain transactions 
amounts billed or payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
maintenance agreements are generally twelve month prepaid contracts that are recognized ratably over the service period 
vsoe of fair value for maintenance is measured by the stated renewal rates included in the agreements 
customers may also enter into arrangements that are typically on a time and materials basis for consulting and training services 
vsoe of fair value for consulting and training services is based upon the standard hourly rate we charge for such services when sold separately 
training services are generally prepaid prior to rendering the service 
consulting and training revenues are typically recognized as earned 
consulting revenues are generated primarily from implementation services related to the installation of our products 
these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from the license revenue because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop our services are generally not essential to the functionality of the software 
our products are fully functional upon delivery of the product and implementation does not require significant modification or alteration 
factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include  but are not limited to degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments  and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
payments related to the software product to which the services relate are typically billed independently from the services and  therefore  are not coincident with performance of such services 
license agreements generally do not include acceptance provisions 
in the infrequent circumstance where an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements  license revenue is generally recognized together with the consulting services using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts and accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered  services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
license revenue from resellers or distributors is recognized upon sell through to the end customer 
if we determine that collection of a license fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
accounts receivable allowances we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are based upon a review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are made at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these provisions  we analyze several factors  including our historical collection experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the accounts receivable allowances does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  we may record additional provisions for accounts receivable allowances 
we record the provision for accounts receivable allowances in general and administrative expense and as a reduction of revenue in order to match the underlying cause of the provision to the appropriate classification in our consolidated statement of operations 
our accounts receivable allowance was million at june   and million at june  the total provision for accounts receivable allowances was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
of these provisions  million  million  and million were recorded in general and administrative expense in fiscal   and  respectively  and million  million  and million were recorded as a reduction of revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been 
table of contents recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  additional valuation allowances may need to be recorded which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
our accounting for income taxes also requires us to exercise judgment for issues relating to known matters under discussion with tax authorities and transactions yet to be settled 
as a result  we maintain a tax liability for contingencies and regularly assess the adequacy of this tax liability 
we record liabilities for known tax contingencies when  in our judgment  it is probable that a liability has been incurred 
it is reasonably possible that actual amounts payable resulting from audits by tax authorities could be materially different from the liabilities we have recorded due to the complex nature of the tax legislation that affects us 
valuation of goodwill  intangibles  and long lived assets we account for goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires us to review for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this impairment review involves a two step process as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
based upon our single business approach to decision making  planning  and resource allocation  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit  and we are required to make estimates regarding the fair value of that reporting unit when testing for potential impairment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using the market approach 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on our market capitalization 
we account for finite lived intangibles and long lived assets under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires us to review for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant decrease in the market value of the assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on the estimated future discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors that may change in the near term 
results of operations we acquired brio software  inc on october  brio s results of operations have been included in hyperion s results beginning on the date of acquisition

fiscal revenue also includes a full year of revenue associated with the acquisition of brio 
the growth in revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the growth in financial application products and related services and the acquisition of brio and the resulting incremental revenue associated with its management reporting products and related services 
the change in foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal by approximately million and favorably affected total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal by approximately million  in both cases primarily due to the increase in strength of the euro against the us dollar 

table of contents software license revenue 
software license revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in software license revenue in fiscal is due to improved sales execution and an increase in demand for our products  primarily in the areas of hyperion planning and hyperion performance suite  the former brio products 
software license revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while the fiscal license revenue growth was predominantly attributable to licensing revenue from hyperion performance suite  we also experienced balanced growth across our financial application product portfolio 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in licensing revenue from our other platform products in fiscal compared to fiscal we market our products through our direct sales force and through channel partners 
to date  we have generated the majority of our license revenue through our direct sales force  but we continue to focus on complementing our direct sales force with channel partners  which include original equipment manufacturers  value added resellers  system integrators  and independent distributors 
license revenue from channel partners comprised of total license revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the percentage of license revenue derived from our channel partners can fluctuate between periods  as it is sensitive to individual large transactions that are neither predictable nor consistent in size or timing 
no single channel partner or direct customer represented more than of total revenues during the periods presented

cost of software license revenue consists primarily of royalty expenses  amortization of capitalized software development costs  amortization of acquired technologies  and the cost of product packaging and documentation materials

this increase was primarily due to the increase in amortization of acquired technologies related to the acquisitions of qiq solutions in july and razza solutions in january cost of software license revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while software license revenue increased 
this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in royalty expense resulting from a different mix of product sales as well as the termination of our oem relationship with crystal decisions 
partially offsetting the decrease in royalty expense in fiscal was a slight increase in acquired technology amortization expense primarily resulting from our acquisitions of the alcar group in april and brio in october

capitalized software product development costs are amortized over the estimated economic lives of the products  which is generally three years 
the amortization of capitalized software development costs begins upon the general release of the software to customers

cost of maintenance and services revenue consists largely of compensation and benefits for support  consulting  and training personnel 
cost of maintenance and services revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in cost of maintenance and services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally due to a million increase in employee expenses and a million increase in subcontractor and other external personnel costs  which  in turn  resulted mostly from increased revenue year over year

gross margin on maintenance and services revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the sequential increase in gross margin on maintenance and services revenue during these fiscal years was due to increased consulting utilization rates and  to a lesser extent  due to a higher mix of maintenance revenue as a percentage of total maintenance and services revenues

this increase was offset by a million decrease in bad debt expense 
general and administrative headcount grew to employees at june   from employees at june  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was principally due to an million increase in employee expenses that resulted primarily from our acquisition of brio in october general and administrative headcount grew to employees at june   from employees at june   primarily due to the addition of incremental brio employees 
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges totaled million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we signed a lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters facility located in santa clara  california  that accommodates all employees in the san francisco bay area 
during fiscal  we vacated our corporate facilities in sunnyvale as well as offices in santa clara and san francisco  california  which resulted in a restructuring charge in fiscal of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we signed an engineering consulting agreement with a consulting firm based in bangalore  india  in an effort to increase our offshore development capacity and capability 
the expansion of our offshore initiative has been gradual over fiscal and has resulted so far in about additional developers contributing to our development efforts in india 
because of this initiative  in july we reduced our us based development staff by approximately employees  or approximately of our development headcount  and recorded a restructuring charge in fiscal of approximately million 
this restructuring charge consisted of severance and related benefits costs 
in connection with the acquisition of brio in october  management approved and initiated plans to restructure the operations of hyperion to eliminate certain duplicative activities and reduce the combined company s cost structure 
consequently  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million in fiscal  including million of employee severance costs and million of facility closure costs 
in june  we announced a corporate restructuring plan designed to bring costs more in line with revenues and strengthen the financial performance of the company  which resulted in a reduction of the workforce by approximately  or of worldwide headcount 
employee groups impacted by the restructuring included personnel involved in corporate services  product business units  sales and customer support 
in addition  we consolidated some of our facilities and exited other facilities 
in june  the total amount recorded as restructuring and other charges was million 
in fiscal   and  we increased reduced the restructuring charges recorded in fiscal by million  million  and million  respectively 
these adjustments resulted primarily from changes to our estimates of sublease income related to our facility exit costs and did not represent new restructuring activities 

table of contents we account for restructuring activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard supersedes the guidance provided by emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  which was applied to our restructuring activity in fiscal year under both standards  the costs associated with our restructuring activity are included as charges to our results of operations

 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  we account for restructuring activities related to our acquisition of brio by allocating certain costs to the purchase price of the company in the year of acquisition 
the following table sets forth the activity in hyperion s restructuring accruals accounted for under eitf  which are included in restructuring liabilities and long term restructuring liabilities and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in thousands asset severance facilities impairments total balance at june  restructuring costs  net of adjustments non cash items cash payments balance at june  restructuring costs  net of adjustments non cash items cash payments balance at june  of the total million of restructuring accruals  million is accounted for in restructuring liabilities and million is included in long term restructuring liabilities and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of june  payments due under long term lease obligations will continue to be made over the remaining lives of the leases 
the restructuring costs recorded are based on hyperion s restructuring plans that have been committed to by management and are subject to refinement 
if we are unable to maintain a cost structure that is in appropriate balance with revenue going forward  whether due to failure to increase revenue adequately or failure to keep costs down  we could find it necessary to further adjust our cost structure through the execution of additional restructuring plans 
in process research and development during fiscal  in connection with our acquisition of brio  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of in process research and development costs ipr d related to the brio product line operations because the purchased research and development had no alternative uses and had not reached technological feasibility 
the fair value assigned to ipr d was determined using the income approach 
the stage of completion for the project was estimated to determine the discount rate of to be applied to the valuation of the in process technology 
in fiscal  no amount was allocated to ipr d expense as a result of our acquisitions of qiq solutions in july or razza solutions in january 
table of contents interest and other income interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances 
interest and other income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to increases in interest rates and increases in balances of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
interest and other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to declines in short term interest rates 
interest and other expense interest and other expense consists primarily of interest paid and amortization of deferred issuance costs related to our convertible subordinated notes 
interest and other expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we redeemed our remaining convertible subordinated notes with face values totaling million  which significantly contributed to the decrease in interest and other expense in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal gain loss on redemption of debt during the second quarter of fiscal  we redeemed our remaining convertible subordinated notes with face values totaling million 
this redemption resulted in the recognition of a loss of million in fiscal  which was comprised of the redemption premium paid as well as the write off of associated deferred issuance costs 
during the first and second quarters of fiscal  we repurchased convertible subordinated notes with face values totaling million for a total cost of approximately million  which resulted in the recognition of a gain  net of the write off of associated deferred issuance costs  of approximately million 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the lower effective income tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal is due  in part  to the increase in the benefit of the tax exempt interest  extraterritorial income exclusion  and research and development tax credits 
in addition  the effective tax rate in fiscal includes the impact of the charge for in process research and development of million  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the in process research and development charge  the effective income tax rate in fiscal would have been 
net income we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal our strongest quarter each year is typically our fourth fiscal quarter 
based on historical seasonality trends  we expect revenue and related sales compensation expenses to decrease in the first fiscal quarter 
in addition  we expect first quarter results to be impacted by the general lower economic activity in europe during the summer months

at june   our working capital was million 
in accordance with the definition of cash equivalents in sfas  statement of cash flows  we reclassified million and million of auction rate securities with contractual maturities exceeding ninety days from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments on the consolidated balance sheets as of june  and  respectively 
we also made corresponding adjustments to the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended june   and june   to reflect the gross purchases and sales and maturities of these securities as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the years ended june   and june   before this reclassification  net cash provided by used in investing activities related to these investments of million and million  respectively  were included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows

in fiscal  our operating cash flows resulted primarily from the net income generated during the period  an increase in income taxes payable  and the positive impact of non cash items reflected in net income such as depreciation and amortization expense and the impact of the income tax benefit from stock option exercises 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to increased revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
our operating cash flows in fiscal were primarily the result of the net income generated during the period and the positive impact of non cash items reflected in net income such as depreciation and amortization expense and the impact of the income tax benefit from stock option exercises  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
in fiscal  our operating cash flows were primarily attributable to the net income generated during the periods and the positive impact of non cash items reflected in the net income amount such as depreciation and amortization expense  as well as a decrease in accounts receivable

net cash provided by used in investing activities amounted to million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from our purchases of investments  net of sales and maturities  of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  and payments for acquisitions of million 
the higher level of capital expenditures in fiscal primarily related to leasehold improvements and purchases of computer and office equipment for our new corporate headquarters facility in santa clara  california 
although we intend to continue to invest in assets necessary to support our infrastructure as well as our growing employee base  we expect overall capital expenditures to decrease in fiscal as our headquarter relocation was

in fiscal  hyperion s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock  and in fiscal  the board of directors authorized an additional million 
as of june   we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional million of common stock under our repurchase plans 
we expect to continue to repurchase shares of common stock under this plan in fiscal  subject to market conditions 
we intend to fund our capital requirements  as well as our liquidity needs  with existing cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances as well as cash generated from future operations  if any 
however  capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our future revenue  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of development projects and increases in operating expenses  all of which are subject to uncertainty 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances  and cash generated from our future operations  if any  will be sufficient to finance our business through at least june  to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations are insufficient to fund future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
in addition  our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations will be impacted by changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products as well as our ability to manage operating expenses and achieve further operational efficiencies

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas replaces accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of change a cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle whereas sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
sfas enhances the consistency of financial information between periods 
sfas will be effective beginning with our first quarter of fiscal year we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  fasb issued a statement  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
and sfas r that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method that hyperion currently uses and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the effective date of the new standard is for fiscal years beginning after june   which for hyperion will be the first quarter of fiscal in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
regarding the staff s interpretation of sfas r 
this interpretation provides the staff s views regarding interactions between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
the interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of sfas r and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided 
we will follow the guidance prescribed in sab in connection with our adoption of sfas r 
we plan to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method  under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the previous requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas r 
compensation expense calculated under sfas r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
upon adoption of sfas r  we plan to use the black scholes model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we expect this standard to have a significant impact on the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as cash flow from financing activities  rather than as cash flow from operations as required under sfas this requirement will reduce net cash flows from operations and increase net cash flows from financing activities in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  the amount of such excess tax deductions from option exercises were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
in addition  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however  the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  beginning with fiscal year  we have adopted the disclosure requirements of eitf although we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the accounting provisions of eitf  we do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our 
table of contents financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
product enhancement and new product introductions involve inherent risks 
hyperion competes in a market characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware and software development  evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
hyperion continually seeks to expand and refresh its product offerings to include newer features or products  and enter into agreements allowing integration of third party technology into hyperion s products 
for example  system  hyperion s integrated bpm system  is a significant undertaking for hyperion 
the introduction of new products or updated versions of continuing products has inherent risks  including  but not limited to product quality  including the possibility of software defects  delays in releasing new products  customers delaying purchase decisions in anticipation of new products to be released  the fit of the new products and features with the customer s needs  the successful adaptation of third party technology into hyperion s products  educating hyperion s sales  marketing  and consulting personnel to work with the new products and features  competition from earlier and more established entrants  market acceptance of initial product releases  technological challenges involved in integrating hyperion products into cohesive business performance management systems offerings  marketing effectiveness  including challenges in distribution  and the accuracy of assumptions about the nature of customer demand 
hyperion s failure to successfully introduce  market  and sell new products and technologies  enhance and improve existing products in a timely manner  and properly position and or price its products  as well as undetected errors or delays in new products or new versions of a product could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business  results of operations  or financial position 
these risks tend to be greater when newer products make up a larger portion of the overall product mix 
as more and more of these newer products are deployed  hyperion s service and maintenance organizations  along with its partners  must rapidly increase their ability to install and service these products  and hyperion must rapidly improve their ease of implementation and ease of use 
the failure to successfully increase these capacities and make these improvements could result in significantly lower customer satisfaction  which could lead to lower revenues and profits 
inadequate customer acceptance of hyperion s product and service initiatives would materially adversely affect hyperion s business  operating results  and financial condition 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may not be predictable and may result in significant volatility in our stock price 
our product revenue has fluctuated and our quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate based on  among other things  the timing of the execution and termination of customer agreements in a given quarter 
the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products and services in our markets may create additional volatility in our results 
we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue or expenses 
because our staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels  and because a high percentage of our costs are fixed  small variations in the timing of the recognition of specific revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  many of our customers delay purchases of our products until the end of each quarter 
if we are unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  any significant revenue shortfall would likely have an immediate negative effect on our operating results 
moreover  we believe the challenges and difficulties that we face  as outlined above with respect to our financial forecasts  also apply to securities analysts that may publish estimates of our financial results 
our operating results may fail to meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or our investors due 
table of contents to a wide variety of factors  including fluctuations in financial ratios or other metrics used to measure performance 
if this occurs  we would expect to experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our stock 
hyperion operates in a very competitive environment 
the markets in which hyperion competes are intensely competitive  highly fragmented  and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
hyperion has experienced  and expects it will continue to experience  vigorous competition from current competitors and new competitors  some of whom may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than hyperion does 
cognos competes with hyperion across a wide range of products  offering what they refer to as corporate performance management solutions  as do  generally  the major erp vendors  including sap  oracle  and business objects 
many other companies compete in specific areas of hyperion s business 
sas and oracle have olap products and analytic applications  business objects and cognos have query and reporting products  and numerous smaller vendors offer specific applications that compete with a single hyperion product 
hyperion expects additional competition as other established and emerging companies  including microsoft  sap  and oracle  move further into both the application and platform parts of the business performance management software market 
this competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share  any of which would materially adversely affect hyperion s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  as we develop and enhance our software and complementary products  the resulting new functionality may duplicate the functionality of  and thus compete with  other products offered by our channel partners 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share  any of which would materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing their ability to address the needs of our existing and prospective customers 
further competitive pressures  such as those resulting from competitors discounting of their products  may require us to reduce the price of our software products  which would materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
also  the enterprise software market may continue to consolidate through merger or acquisition 
if one or more of our competitors merges or partners with another of our competitors  or if we became the subject of an unsolicited acquisition by another enterprise  such change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete 
our key partners may also consolidate with new and existing competitors  which could materially affect our ability to expand the market for our products 
if hyperion is unable to develop or acquire new and enhanced products that achieve widespread market acceptance  hyperion may be unable to recoup product development costs  and hyperion s earnings and revenue may decline 
hyperion s future success depends on its ability to address the rapidly changing needs of its customers by developing or acquiring new products and introducing such products  product updates  and services on a timely basis 
hyperion must also extend the operation of its products to new platforms and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
hyperion commits substantial resources to developing new software products and services 
if the markets for these new products do not develop as anticipated  or demand for its products and services in these markets does not materialize or occurs more slowly than hyperion expects  hyperion will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing corresponding revenue  and hyperion s business and operating results could be adversely affected 
failure to upgrade older products will adversely affect sales 
as hyperion or its competition introduce newer products  the market s demand for hyperion s older products declines 
declining demand reduces revenue from additional licenses and reduces maintenance revenue from past purchasers of hyperion s software 
we must continually upgrade older products in order for customers to continue to see value in hyperion s maintenance services 
if hyperion is unable to provide continued improvements in functionality  or  alternatively  move customers from older to newer products  declining maintenance and new license revenue from older products could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business 

table of contents hyperion typically has back ended quarters which may cause its actual revenues in a quarter to vary from sales forecasts 
quarterly revenues and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of the signing of licensing agreements and product deliveries during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
significant portions of hyperion s quarterly software licensing agreements are concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter  generally with a concentration of such revenues in the final week of that month 
there also is greater uncertainty surrounding the ultimate signing of significant transactions with enterprise customers  whose sales cycles are typically longer in duration and may require several levels of approval 
due to the relatively fixed nature of certain costs  including personnel and facilities expenses  a decline or shortfall in quarterly and or annual revenues typically results in lower profitability or may result in losses 
prior to the very end of any quarter  hyperion must rely on its forecasts of revenue for planning  modeling  and other purposes 
however  forecasts are only estimates and may not correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
consequently  a significant discrepancy between actual results and sales forecasts could cause hyperion to improperly plan or budget and thereby adversely affect hyperion s business or results of operations 
any publicly stated revenue or earnings projections by hyperion are especially subject to this risk 
a change in pricing or marketing could adversely affect hyperion s business 
in an effort to simplify and clarify hyperion s product positioning and marketing  hyperion periodically makes changes to its product pricing  packaging  configuration  or product descriptions  as it is doing in a comprehensive manner with system any product price reductions may not be offset by sufficient increases in unit sales to maintain or increase license revenues  and any broadly based changes to pricing or marketing messages could cause customers to change or delay their purchasing decisions in response to such revisions 
additional risks of such changes include delays in transactions as hyperion s sales force learns how to deploy the new pricing or convey hyperion s new marketing messages and delay or loss of revenues as the competition reacts to the pricing and marketing changes  any of which could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business  results of operations  or financial position 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect results 
hyperion conducts a significant portion of its business in currencies other than the united states dollar 
hyperion s operating results are  therefore  subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
hyperion s revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the united states dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the united states dollar weakens 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies  particularly the euro  relative to the value of the united states dollar positively affected revenues and operating results in fiscal if the united states dollar strengthens relative to other currencies in the future  our revenues  operating results  and cash flows will be adversely affected 
hyperion may not be able to continue its operational improvements 
as part of hyperion s focus on improving its operating margins  hyperion is driving toward increased efficiencies in its sales force  as well as hyperion s services  product development  product marketing  finance  information technology  human resources and other administrative processes 
the ability to continue to realize current efficiencies and find ways to improve on past performance is crucial to the improvement of operating margins 
any increase in the relative cost of these functions  or failure to continue to realize current efficiencies  could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s profits 
reorganizations may adversely affect productivity 
hyperion has continued to make adjustments to its operations and organization 
for example  during fiscal year  we made changes to the structure of the north american sales organization  added new leadership to our asia pacific operations  and entered into engineering offshoring contracts in india and belarus 
these changes have historically resulted in productivity declines and could have a negative effect on revenue in the short term 
the revised operations and or organization must keep improving over past performance in order to provide better operating margins and efficiencies 
failure to maintain or improve performance and productivity could materially adversely impact hyperion s revenue and profits 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and are exposed to future 
table of contents risks of non compliance  and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  beginning with this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending june   we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
such report contains  among other matters  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
such report must also contain a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on management s assessment of such internal controls 
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso provides a framework for companies to assess and improve their internal control systems 
auditing standard no 
provides the professional standards and related performance guidance for independent registered public accounting firms to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting under section management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting requires management to make subjective judgments and  particularly because auditing standard no 
is newly effective  some of the judgments will be in areas that may be open to interpretation and therefore the report may be uniquely difficult to prepare and our independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with our assessments 
we have recently completed the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of our assessment  testing  and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june   our internal control over financial reporting was effective 
however  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods  our financial results or the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 
we will incur additional expenses and commitment of management s time in connection with further evaluations 
hyperion s international operations are subject to significant risks 
hyperion derives a substantial portion of its revenue from customers located outside of the united states 
hyperion s international operations are subject to risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates and inflation  which could reduce hyperion s customers ability to obtain financing for software products or which could make hyperion s products more expensive in those countries  difficulties in hedging foreign currency transaction exposures  potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation  or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  imposition of foreign laws and other governmental controls  including trade and employment restrictions  longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations  including increased turnover as economic opportunities increase in countries such as india and difficulties related to administering hyperion s stock option plan in some foreign countries  difficulties in coordinating the activities of hyperion s geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations  competition from local suppliers  costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple languages  and political unrest  war  or terrorism  particularly in areas in which hyperion has facilities 
hyperion also has distributed research and development r d across the united states in california  connecticut  and texas and in several countries including india  australia  and belarus 
it may be difficult to manage significant projects across such distributed r d centers due to risk factors noted above  as well as  potential risks associated with disruptions of power and internet network infrastructures located abroad 
hyperion may not be able to successfully address each of these challenges 
hyperion faces significant challenges and risks associated with compliance and internal governance 

table of contents while we believe we currently have adequate control over financial reporting  hyperion s numerous office locations  high number of employees  and varied distribution methods  among other considerations  make it possible that our high standards of ethics  governance  and compliance with law may not always be met 
for example  hyperion has in excess of partners worldwide 
some of the business practices in countries in which our partners operate on our behalf may not conform fully with local or us laws 
while we are diligent about monitoring the business practices affecting our foreign subsidiaries  we may not be able to detect improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners which could put hyperion at risk regarding possible violations of such laws as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
serious violations of the fcpa could result in fines or other criminal or civil sanctions which could have a material impact on hyperion s operating results and financial condition 
other examples of potential compliance and operational risks include the possibility that we will encounter challenges in complying with revenue recognition best practices  with high volume order processing and in product fulfillment 
there are significant risks related to any business combination 
hyperion has made  and may in the future make  acquisitions of  mergers with  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services  and technologies 
there are risks involved in these activities  including but not limited to the possibility that hyperion pays more than the value it derives from the acquisition  the difficulty of integrating the products  operations  and personnel of the acquired businesses  the possibility that all aspects of the integration are not completed or that all of the anticipated synergies of the acquisition are not realized  difficulties in managing software development activities to define a combined product roadmap  ensuring timely development of new products  timely release of new products to market  and the development of efficient integration and migration processes and tools  the difficulty of retaining key alliances on attractive terms with partners and suppliers  the difficulty of retaining and recruiting key personnel and maintaining employee morale  the potential product liability associated with selling the acquired company s products  the potential disruption of hyperion s ongoing business and the distraction of management from hyperion s business  and the potential write down of impaired goodwill and intangible and other assets 
in particular  hyperion recorded approximately million of goodwill related to the acquisition of brio that will not be amortized in the ordinary course of business 
to the extent that the business acquired in that transaction primarily the performance suite products does not remain competitive  some or all of the goodwill related to that acquisition could be charged against future earnings 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business  results of operations  or financial position  especially in the case of a large acquisition 
hyperion is subject to the possibility of infringement claims 
we rely upon various intellectual property protections  including contractual provisions  patents  copyrights  trademarks  and trade secret laws to preserve our intellectual property rights 
despite our precautions  third parties may misappropriate our intellectual property causing us to lose potential revenue and competitive advantage 
as well  we may ourselves from time to time become subject to claims by third parties that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights 
in either case  we may incur expenditures to police  protect  and defend our interests and may become involved in litigation that could divert the attention of our management 
responding to such claims could result in substantial expense and result in damages  royalties  or injunctive relief  or require us to enter into licensing agreements on unfavorable terms  or redesign or stop selling affected products which could materially disrupt the conduct of our business 
hyperion may be subject to further infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in hyperion s industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
in the past  hyperion has been 
table of contents subjected to patent infringement claims 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipments delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and may require the payment of substantial royalties 
in the event of a successful patent infringement claim against hyperion  hyperion s failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could restrict its ability to sell certain products  which could adversely affect hyperion s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
in november  hyperion filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court for the northern district of california against hyperroll  inc hyperroll to establish that hyperion did not infringe any of hyperroll s patents 
while litigation in the hyperroll matter is ongoing and hyperion will vigorously defend the claims made against us  no assurance can be made of a positive outcome 
enforcement of hyperion s intellectual property rights may be difficult 
hyperion s means of protecting its proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and could be subject to challenge  such as the reexamination of one of its patents by the united states patent and trademark office 
despite our efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and  while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
we have entered into source code escrow agreements with a number of our customers and channel partners requiring the release of our source code under certain conditions 
generally  such agreements provide that such parties will have a limited  nonexclusive right to use such code in the event that there is an undismissed bankruptcy proceeding by or against us  if we cease to do business  or if we materially fail to meet our contractual obligations 
the release of source code may increase the likelihood of misappropriation by third parties 
in protecting our intellectual property rights  in december  we filed an action against outlooksoft corporation outlooksoft in federal district court for the eastern district of texas  charging that outlooksoft is infringing two hyperion patents relating to our financial consolidation  reporting and analysis applications  hyperion financial management and hyperion enterprise 
while litigation in the outlooksoft matter is ongoing and hyperion intends to vigorously pursue the protection of its intellectual property  and will vigorously defend the charges of patent infringement made against us  no assurance can be made of a positive outcome 
hyperion s stock price may be volatile 
the market price of hyperion s common stock is subject to significant fluctuations 
the market price of hyperion s common stock may be significantly affected by many factors  including but not limited to  the announcement of new products  product enhancements or technological innovation by hyperion or hyperion s competitors  announcements of acquisitions by hyperion  changes in hyperion s or hyperion s competitors results of operations  changes in revenue  revenue growth rates and revenue mix  changes in earnings estimates by market analysts  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
technology stocks have experienced wide fluctuations in prices  which sometimes have been unrelated to their operating performance 
the market price of hyperion s common stock could be adversely affected by such fluctuations 
hyperion is dependent upon indirect channel partners 
in addition to its direct sales force  hyperion relies on indirect channel partners such as oems  vars  and distributors for licensing and support of its products in the united states and internationally 
license revenue from channel partners comprised of hyperion s total license revenue for fiscal indirect channel sales involve a number of special risks  including hyperion s lack of control over the delivery of its products to end users  hyperion s resellers and distributors may terminate their relationship with hyperion on short notice  and hyperion s resellers and distributors may market and distribute competing products 

table of contents hyperion s current indirect channel partners may not market or support hyperion s products effectively or be able to release their products embedded with hyperion products in a timely manner 
hyperion may not be able to effectively manage conflicts between its various indirect channel and direct customers  and economic conditions or industry demand may adversely affect indirect channel partners or indirect channel partners may devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
revenues derived from indirect channel partners may fluctuate significantly in subsequent periods 
hyperion is exposed to product liability claims 
hyperion s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit hyperion s exposure to potential product liability claims  and hyperion carries insurance to protect against such claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in hyperion s license agreements may not be effective as a result of us or foreign laws or ordinances or because of judicial decisions  and that liability insurance may not be available  or that coverage for specific claims may be denied 
although hyperion has not experienced any material product liability claims to date  the sale and support of business performance management products by hyperion entails the risk of such claims 
a successful product liability claim brought against hyperion could have a material adverse effect upon hyperion s business  operating results and financial condition 
defects in hyperion s products could increase its costs  adversely affect its reputation  diminish demand for its products  and hurt its operating results 
as a result of their complexity  hyperion s software products may contain undetected errors or viruses 
errors in new products or product enhancements might not be detected until after initiating commercial shipments  which could result in additional costs  delays  and possible damage to hyperion s reputation and could cause diminished demand for hyperion s products 
this could lead to customer dissatisfaction and reduce the opportunity to renew maintenance or sell new licenses 
employee turnover could adversely impact revenue  costs  and productivity 
as employees leave hyperion  it suffers loss of productivity while new employees are hired or promoted into vacant positions 
there are also costs of recruiting and relocating new employees 
new employees must learn the hyperion organization  products  and procedures 
promoted employees must learn new skills 
all of this takes time  reduces productivity  and increases cost 
the potential adverse impact of employee turnover is greater for situations involving senior positions in the company 
turnover rates tend to increase as economic conditions improve 
if turnover increases  the adverse impacts of turnover could materially affect hyperion s costs  productivity  or ability to respond quickly to the competitive environment 
in particular  the recruiting market for experienced enterprise software sales personnel is very competitive  and we may be limited in our ability to attract and retain key sales talent 
some provisions in hyperion s charter documents and its stockholder rights plan may prevent or deter an acquisition of hyperion 
some of the provisions in hyperion s charter documents may deter or prevent certain corporate actions  such as a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest  which could affect the market value of hyperion s securities 
these provisions include  but are not limited to hyperion s board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with any rights it may determine 
consequently  without shareholder approval  hyperion s board of directors may issue preferred stock that has rights superior to the outstanding hyperion common stock  hyperion s board of directors is classified into three groups  with each group of directors holding office for three years 
the effect of this classified board is that two annual meetings  not one  are required to replace a majority of the board of directors  hyperion stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes for directors  and special meetings of hyperion stockholders may be called only by hyperion s president or by the president or secretary upon written request by a majority of the board of directors and may not be called by hyperion s stockholders 

table of contents hyperion has in place a stockholder rights plan that is designed to discourage coercive takeover offers 
in general  hyperion s stockholder rights plan makes it uneconomic for any person to acquire more than a interest in hyperion without the consent of the hyperion board of directors 
hyperion s board of directors could utilize the provisions of its charter documents and stockholder rights plan to resist an offer from a third party to acquire hyperion  including an offer to acquire hyperion common stock at a premium to its trading price or an offer that is otherwise considered favorable by hyperion stockholders 
the accounting treatment for employee stock options has changed and will significantly impact hyperion s earnings for periods beginning with the first quarter of fiscal beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  hyperion will be subject to the financial accounting standards board statement  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
and  that requires public companies to report compensation expense related to stock options and other forms of stock based compensation based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant dates 
as a result  our earnings will be significantly adversely affected 
see also  note  summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation  of notes to consolidated financial statements for current disclosures regarding the treatment on our consolidated statement of operations 
failure to obtain approval for additional shares of common stock to be granted as employee stock options or restricted stock could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
from time to time  we seek to obtain stockholder approval for additional shares of common stock that could be granted as stock options or restricted stock to our employees and directors 
there is some public sentiment that equity compensation is not in the stockholder s best interest 
as a result of this and other factors  we may not be able to secure approval for these additional shares 
if we do not get such approval  we will be forced to reduce the number of stock options and restricted stock that we are able to grant  which will adversely impact our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  many of whom have come to expect significant equity from technology companies as part of their compensation packages 
we are incurring substantial costs and devoting more management resources to comply with increasing regulation of corporate governance and disclosure 
we are spending a significant amount of management time and resources to understand and comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations  and rules of the nasdaq national market  the market on which our shares are listed 
allocating the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards has increased general and administrative expenses and caused a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we transact business in various foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from non functional currency denominated trade accounts receivable and intercompany accounts receivable 
intercompany accounts receivable arise when software royalty fees and certain other costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary  which is generally their local currency 
from time to time  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of these trade receivables and the effects of certain intercompany receivables for which we anticipate settlement in the foreseeable future 
as a result  increases or decreases in these accounts due to foreign exchange rate changes are offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts so as to minimize foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency balances and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in our consolidated statements of operations 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not material for fiscal   and as of june   and june   we had net forward contracts to sell us dollar equivalent of million and million  
table of contents respectively  in foreign currency 
principal currencies hedged included the euro  british pound  japanese yen  and singapore dollar 
an immediate change in currency exchange rates affecting our foreign exchange transactions would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
the change in foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal by approximately million and favorably affected total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal by approximately million  in both cases primarily due to the increase in strength of the euro against the us dollar 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of high quality  liquid securities 
at june   and june   our short term investments consisted of investment grade debt securities with a fair value of million and million  respectively 
the portfolio is invested in securities with relatively short duration to minimize interest rate risk and for liquidity purposes in the event of immediate cash needs 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our investment portfolio
