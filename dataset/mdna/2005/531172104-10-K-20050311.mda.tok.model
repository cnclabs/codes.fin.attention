item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has an ownership interest in and operates industrial and office properties located primarily in the mid atlantic  southeastern and midwestern united states the properties in operation totaling million square feet 
in addition  as of december   the company has properties under development the properties under development and together with the properties in operation the properties and owns  acres of land  substantially all of which is zoned for commercial use 
included above are properties comprising million square feet and acres of developable land owned by unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company focuses on creating value for shareholders and increasing profitability and cash flow 
with respect to its properties in operation  the company endeavors to maintain high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates 
the company pursues development opportunities that it believes will create value and yield acceptable returns 
the company also acquires properties which it believes will create long term value  and disposes of properties which no longer fit within the company s strategic objectives or in situations where it can optimize cash proceeds 
the company s operating results depend primarily upon income from rental operations and are substantially influenced by rental demand for the properties in operation 
in the company continued to experience the effects of the generally slow real estate economy that has persisted since this economy has presented a particularly difficult real estate market for landlords 
these circumstances impacted many aspects of the company s business 
the properties in operation  which represent over of the company s revenue  were subjected to market conditions characterized by an oversupply of leaseable space and soft demand 
these conditions resulted in downward pressure on rental rates and upward pressure on lease transaction costs related to tenant inducements eg tenant improvement costs 
in the face of these conditions  the company successfully leased million square feet and attained occupancy of  which it believes represents performance which is substantially better than market 
however  in spite of the increase in occupancy  due to the decreases in rental rates for renewal and replacement leases  property level operating income for the same store properties properties owned since january  declined for when compared to by on a straight line basis and on a cash basis 
see further discussion of same store results below 
the company believes that these trends for the properties in operation ie  oversupply of leaseable space  downward pressure on rents  upward pressure on transaction costs  which have persisted in and will continue in the aggregate in  notwithstanding improvements in some markets 
although rental rates in certain markets are starting to stabilize  generally rents on renewal or replacement leases will be less than rents on expiring leases 
conditions in for the acquisition of properties were very competitive 
the company  however  acquired buildings representing million square feet and a total investment of million 
these acquisitions generally served to increase the presence or balance the product mix in markets the company believes to have significant potential 
for  the company believes that property acquisitions will be in the to million range and  similar to  many of the acquired properties will be either vacant or under leased 
the company believes that these properties are more attractively priced and will positively contribute to earnings upon lease up and stabilization 
dispositions of properties which no longer fit within the company s strategic objectives or in situations where it can optimize cash proceeds continued in during  the company sold million in operating properties 
the company anticipates that dispositions will be in the to million range in in  the company continued to pursue development opportunities 
in  the company brought into service million of development properties and initiated million in real estate development 
the company believes that in build to suit activity will continue and that conditions in certain markets may continue to support the initiation of inventory projects ie projects that are less than leased prior to the commencement of construction 
in january  the company commenced construction of a million square foot  million office tower in philadelphia s central business district 
comcast corporation has signed a lease for  square feet of space in this office tower

such statements indicate that assumptions have been used that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual financial results or management plans and objectives to differ materially from those projected or expressed herein  including the effect of national and regional economic conditions  rental demand  the company s ability to identify and secure additional properties and sites that meet its criteria for acquisition or development  the availability and cost of capital  the effect of prevailing market interest rates  and other risks described from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission sec 
given these uncertainties  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases these estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
capitalized costs expenditures directly related to the acquisition  or improvement of real estate  including interest and other costs capitalized on development projects and land being readied for development  are included in net real estate and are stated at cost 
the company considers a development property substantially complete upon the completion of tenant build out  but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  development related salaries and other costs incurred during the period of development 
capitalized development related salaries and benefits historically represent approximately of the cost of developed properties brought into service 
the determination to capitalize rather than expense costs requires the company to evaluate the status of the development activity 
capitalized interest for the year ended december  was million 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants on an on going basis 
based on these reviews  provisions are established  and an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its tenants to make required rental payments is maintained 
as of december  and  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company s bad debt expense totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december   or of operating revenue for compared to for impairment of real estate the company evaluates its real estate investments upon occurrence of significant adverse changes in operations to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the recorded value 
if any real estate investment is considered impaired  the carrying value of the property is written down to its estimated fair value 
during the years ended december  and  the company recognized impairment losses of million and million 
the impairment loss of million was on a parcel of land in the midwest region 
the impairment loss included million related to three parcels of land and an impairment loss of million on assets held for sale 
this loss was subsequently realized later in upon the disposal of those assets held for sale 
the determination of whether impairment exists requires the company to make estimates  judgments and assumptions about the future utility of the assets 
the company has evaluated each of the properties and land held for development and has determined that there are no additional valuation adjustments that need to be made at december  intangibles in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial standards sfas no 
 business combinations  the company allocates the purchase price of real estate to land  building and improvements and intangibles based on the relative fair value of each component 
the value ascribed to in place leases is based on the rental rates for the existing leases compared to the company s estimate of the fair market lease rates for leases of similar terms and present valuing the difference based on an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired 
origination values are also assigned to in place leases  and  where appropriate  value is assigned to customer relationships 
origination cost estimates include the costs to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in place leases  including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
additionally  the company estimates carrying costs during the expected lease up periods including real estate taxes  other operating expenses and lost rentals at market rates 
the company depreciates the amounts allocated to building and improvements over years and the amounts allocated to intangible assets relating to in place leases  which are included in deferred financing and leasing costs in the accompanying balance sheet  over the remaining term of the related leases 
in the event that a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of the intangible is charged to expense 
results of operations the following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
it compares the results of operations of the company for the year ended december  with the results of operations of the company for the year ended december   and the results of operations of the company for the year ended december  with the results of operations of the company for the year ended december  as a result of the varying level of development  acquisition and disposition activities by the company in and  the overall operating results of the company during such periods are not directly comparable 
however  certain data  including the same store comparison  do lend themselves to direct comparison 
this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  the company s average gross investment in operating real estate owned for the year ended december  increased to  million from  million at december  this increase resulted from the increased investment in real estate acquired or developed  partially offset by property dispositions 
this increased investment in operating real estate resulted in increases in rental revenue  rental property operating expenses and real estate taxes  and depreciation and amortization expense 
total operating revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this million increase was primarily due to the net increase in investment in real estate 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in termination fees  which totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in termination fees are fees that the company has agreed to accept in consideration for permitting certain tenants to terminate their leases prior to the contractual expiration date

calculation of funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit has issued a standard definition for funds from operations as defined below 
the sec has agreed to the disclosure of this non gaap financial measure on a per share basis in its release no 
 conditions for use of non gaap financial measures 
the company believes that the calculation of funds from operations is helpful to investors and management as it is a measure of the company s operating performance that excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions 
as a result  year over year comparison of funds from operations reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities  general and administrative expenses  and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
in addition  management believes that funds from operations provides useful information to the investment community about the company s financial performance when compared to other reit s since funds from operations is generally recognized as the standard for reporting the operating performance of a reit 
funds from operations available to common shareholders is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
funds from operations available to common shareholders does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations available to common shareholders also does not represent cash flows generated from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
funds from operations ffo available to common shareholders for the years ended december    and are as follows in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  reconciliation of net income to ffo basic net income preferred share distributions excess of preferred share redemption over carrying amount basic income available to common shareholders basic income available to common shareholders per weighted average share adjustments depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures depreciation and amortization gain on property dispositions minority interest share in addback for depreciation and amortization  gain loss on property dispositions funds from operations available to common shareholders basic basic funds from operations available to common shareholders per weighted average share reconciliation of net income to ffo diluted net income preferred share distributions excess of preferred share redemption over carrying amount diluted income available to common shareholders diluted income available to common shareholders per weighted average share adjustments depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures depreciation and amortization gain on property dispositions minority interest less preferred share distributions funds from operations available to common shareholders diluted diluted funds from operations available to common shareholders per weighted average share reconciliation of weighted average shares weighted average common shares all basic calculations dilutive shares for long term compensation plans diluted shares for net income calculations weighted average common units diluted shares for funds from operations calculations inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years  and as a result  it has not had a significant impact on the company during this period 
the new million credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the new million credit facility will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
to the extent an increase in inflation would result in increased operating costs  such as in insurance  real estate taxes and utilities  substantially all of the tenants leases require the tenants to absorb these costs as part of their rental obligations 
in addition  inflation also may have the effect of increasing market rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its new million credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the interest on the new million credit facility and such other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
the company also uses long term and medium term debt as a source of capital 
these debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company occasionally enters into interest rate protection agreements 
if the interest rates for variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have been increased or decreased by approximately million 
if the interest rate for the fixed rate debt maturing in was basis points higher or lower than its current rate of  the company s interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  the sensitivity analysis above assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
it also does not consider future fluctuations in interest rates or the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to currency risk on its million net investment in the united kingdom 
the company does not believe that this currency risk exposure is material to its financial statements
