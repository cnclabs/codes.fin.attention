item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business the kroger co 
was founded in and incorporated in it is one of the nation s largest retailers  operating  stores under two dozen banners including kroger  ralphs  fred meyer  food less  king soopers  smith s  fry s  fry s marketplace  dillons  qfc and city market 
the company also operates convenience stores  fine jewelry stores  and supermarket fuel centers 
kroger operates manufacturing plants  primarily bakeries and dairies  which supply about two thirds of the private label grocery products sold in the company s retail outlets 
our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores 
we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of our costs to make these products available to our customers 
such costs include procurement and distribution costs  facility occupancy and operational costs  and overhead expenses 
the company s operations are reported as a single operating segment the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers 
our performance the operating environment of the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition  aggressive supercenter expansion  increasing fragmentation of retail formats  and market consolidation 
over the past several years  many traditional supermarket operators  including kroger  have experienced declining profit margins 
in an effort to maintain market share  we have lowered retail prices at a rate faster than we were able to reduce costs 
kroger recognized the major changes in the operating environment and in we implemented a plan to transition to a lower gross margin environment 
during and our identical food store sales without fuel declined 
in we were pleased with the progress of our identical sales  excluding the effect of fuel and the southern california labor dispute  which has now shown sequential improvement for seven of the past eight quarters 
identical food store sales on this same basis increased in this nearly met the target we established at the beginning of the year 
this was accomplished by focusing on our customers needs of high quality perishable products and lowering selected prices 
our internal analysis shows that we hold the or position in of our major markets 
we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores 
according to our internal market share estimates  which include all retail outlets including supercenters and other non traditional retail formats  kroger s market share increased in of our major markets in  declined in and remained unchanged in two 
six of the markets in which our market share declined are in california  including five markets that were significantly affected by the southern california labor dispute 
on a volume weighted basis  kroger s overall market share declined slightly in our major markets 
our and financial results were affected by asset and goodwill impairment charges and two labor disputes that occurred in southern california and west virginia 
in west virginia  we closed stores starting october  when a strike was conducted by a local union of the united food and commercial workers international union ufcw 
these stores were reopened on december  after ratification of a new contract 
in southern california  our ralphs stores  as well as stores operated by safeway  inc and albertson s  inc 
were subject to a labor dispute that started on october  and ended days later on february  we are working hard to rebuild our business in this region 
the recovery from the labor dispute has been slower than we expected 
we continue to emphasize store conditions  associate training  associate engagement and competitive pricing 
we are making progress and have a plan in place to return sales to pre strike levels 
excluding the impairment charges and the effect of the strikes  our net earnings still declined in our increased sales did not translate to increased bottom line earnings 
the competitive environment s pressure on retail prices combined with increased inflation in product costs and increasingly price conscience consumers have resulted in lower gross profit 
additionally  increases in operating and administrative costs  especially employee health care costs and pension costs have been increasing at a higher rate than sales 
future expectations we believe that kroger is now positioned  despite intense price competition  to increase total sales  identical store sales  and earnings 
kroger s plan starts with the customer 
we are listening to our customers through research and focus groups 
our plan centers around those areas that our customers have told us are important 
our focus is on differentiating our stores  being competitive on price  and providing our customers a superior shopping experience as compared to our competitors  in terms of service  product quality  and variety 
the plan should allow us to build a stronger relationship with our customers  position kroger as the retailer of choice  and generate a satisfactory return for our shareholders 
significant  sustainable cost reductions will enable us to achieve our plan 
costs savings will be derived from areas such as process improvements  restructured labor contracts that will allow us to remain competitive  lower product costs  and technology utilization 
kroger s financial strength is an important competitive advantage 
our free cash flow permits us to upgrade and expand our asset base in order to offer customers clean  modern stores that enhance their shopping experience 
our cash flow also enables us to continue reducing debt and buy back stock 
in addition to financial strength  kroger has many other key strengths such as a high quality asset base with leading market shares  broad geographic diversity  multiple retail formats  customer loyalty data and data analysis capability  a successful track record against supercenter competition and industry leading corporate brands 
kroger is focused on consistently meeting the needs of our customers by providing improved service  selection and value 
our associates are key to kroger s success 
we expect the successful execution of our strategy will be clearly evident in our financial results 
further discussion on our industry  the current economic environment and our related strategic plans is included in outlook 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and for compared to comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods  including goodwill and asset impairment charges and labor disputes in west virginia and southern california 
these items are identified and discussed in more detail below in other items and estimated effect of labor disputes 
certain amounts set forth below have been revised from those contained in the preliminary financial statements reported in kroger s earnings release filed on a form k dated march  the changes related to the correction of the amount recorded for deferred income taxes related to the ralphs business combination 
the correction resulted in a change to the goodwill impairment charge related to the ralphs and food less operations in southern california 
net earnings loss we recorded a net loss totaling million  or per share  for  compared to net earnings totaling million  or per diluted share  in and net earnings of  million  or per diluted share  in the decrease in net earnings in and was significantly affected by labor disputes as well as goodwill and asset impairment charges 
these items are more fully described below in other items and estimated effect of labor disputes 
lower gross margins  a result of our investment in pricing due to the competitive operating environment  also affect our year to year net earnings results 
sales total sales in millions percentage increase percentage increase total food store sales without fuel total food store fuel sales total food store sales other sales total sales the change in our total sales is driven by identical store sales and square footage growth  as well as inflation in fuel and other commodities 
we define a food store as an identical store when the store has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters 
we calculate annualized identical food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical sales 
our annualized identical food store sales results are summarized below 
identical food store sales in millions excluding stores affected by labor disputes dollars including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers percentage increase including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers we define a food store as a comparable store when the store has been in operation for five full quarters  including expansions and relocations 
we calculate annualized comparable food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales 
our annualized comparable food store sales results are summarized in the table below 
comparable food store sales in millions excluding stores affected by labor disputes dollars including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers percentage increase including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers sales figures adjusted for the effects of the labor disputes exclude stores involved in labor disputes  as well as food less stores whose sales results were favorably affected by the labor disputes in the southern california region 
our sales in were also affected by inflation and deflation in various commodity groups  our competitive operating environment  the recovery from the labor disputes in west virginia and southern california and the results of our strategic initiatives 
fifo gross margin we calculate first in  first out fifo gross margin as follows sales minus merchandise costs plus last in  first out lifo charge credit 
merchandise costs include advertising  warehousing and transportation  but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense 
fifo gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 
our fifo gross margin rates were  and in  and  respectively 
these declining rates reflect our continued investment in lower retail prices 
higher fuel sales that carry a low gross profit rate reduced our fifo gross margin rates by  and basis points in  and  respectively 
the southern california labor dispute and our related recovery efforts reduced gross profit rates in both and additionally  other items recorded as merchandise costs in  and further affected our fifo gross margin rates 
these items are more fully described below in other items and estimated effect of labor disputes 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative og a expenses  which consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages  health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs  as a percent of sales were  and in  and  respectively 
higher fuel sales reduced our og a rate by  and basis points in  and  respectively 
the labor disputes and several items that are more fully described in other items and estimated effect of labor disputes affected our og a rates in and we continue to emphasize cost containment efforts in all areas and especially in the wage and benefit areas 
in the fourth quarter of  health care costs declined slightly as a percent of sales  the result of progress we have made during labor negotiations 
we expect additional improvement in our og a rate in  particularly as we leverage increasing sales and cost reductions in key areas of our business 
rent expense rent expense  as a percent of sales  was  and in  and  respectively 
the decreases in these rates reflect our continued emphasis on ownership of real estate  partially offset by increased charges for the net present value of lease liabilities recorded for store closings 
depreciation expense depreciation expense  as a percent of sales  was  and for  and  respectively 
the change in these rates reflects our continued emphasis on ownership of real estate  offset by tightening of capital expenditures and the leveraging effect of increased sales 
interest expense net interest expense totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense is the result of lower average borrowings and lower average rates on outstanding debt 
interest expense in  and included million  million and million  respectively  related to the early retirement of debt  more fully described in other items 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for and differ from the effective tax rate for due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill in and the effective income tax rates also differ from the expected statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes

these items should not be considered alternatives to net earnings  net cash provided by operating activities or any other generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure of performance or liquidity 
these items should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for kroger s results as reported in accordance with gaap 
these items include goodwill impairment charges  asset impairment charges  restructuring charges  merger related costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change  all of which are shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations

the transitional impairment review required by the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets resulted in a write off of our jewelry store division goodwill 
items affecting fifo gross margin  lifo charge credit and operating  general and administrative expense item cost conversion in  prior to the merger with fred meyer  we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the item cost method 
the change improved the accuracy of product cost calculations by eliminating the averaging and estimating inherent in the retail method 
during  we adopted the item cost method for the former fred meyer divisions 
the cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to february   cannot be determined 
the effect of the change on the february  inventory valuations  which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods  was included in results for the quarter ended may  this change increased merchandise costs by million and reduced net earnings by million 
we did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior periods because we were unable to determine cost information for these periods 
the item cost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to adoption on february  adoption of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
we adopted eitf issue no 
during this issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances 
due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances  it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory 
historically  we had recognized those allowances as they were earned  based on the fulfillment of the related obligations of the contract 
this accounting treatment was consistent with gaap 
for all contracts entered into or modified after january   we have recognized prospectively  and will continue to recognize  vendor allowances when the related merchandise is sold  in accordance with issue net earnings in were not affected by the adoption of issue no 
adoption of the issue resulted in a million pre tax charge that was included in merchandise costs in this expense was offset by a corresponding million pre tax lifo credit that also was included in merchandise costs in lease liabilities store closing plans due to operational changes  performance improved at five stores  not yet closed  for which store closing liabilities had been recorded as a part of a corporate level strategic plan 
as a result of this improved performance  in we modified our original plans and determined that these five locations will remain open 
additionally  closing and exit costs at other locations included in the original plans were less costly than anticipated 
in total  in  we recorded pre tax income of million to adjust these liabilities to reflect the outstanding lease commitments through at the locations remaining under the plans 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these liabilities 
no charges were recorded in for the present value of lease liabilities for stores considered in the asset impairment review 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which is effective for all exit and disposal activities initiated after december   these liabilities will be recorded when these locations are closed 
during fiscal  we recorded lease liabilities totaling million related to the closing of of these stores 
excess energy purchase commitments during  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of our expected demand for electricity 
sfas no 
required the excess commitments to be marked to fair value through current period earnings each quarter 
we recorded pre tax expense of million and pre tax income of million as a result of the market value adjustment of these excess commitments in and  respectively 
during  we reached an agreement through which we ended supply arrangements in california with dynegy  inc  related to these two contracts and two other electricity contracts that had been previously accounted for as normal purchases normal sales contracts 
the federal energy regulatory commission approved the agreement on july  during  we paid million  before the related tax benefits  to settle disputes with dynegy related to prior over payments  terminate two of the four contracts effective july   and terminate the remaining two agreements effective september  as a result of the settlement  we recorded million of pre tax expense in property tax allowance in  we recorded pre tax income of million related to the reversal of a property tax accrual after we determined the amount to be paid would be less than we originally estimated 
power outage in  we recorded a million pre tax expense for the august power outage in northwest ohio and michigan 
the majority of the expense related to uninsured product losses 
generally  we classify uninsured product and property losses as og a expense 
adjustment to charitable contribution liability in  we recorded million of pre tax income to adjust previously recorded liabilities related to charitable contributions required as a result of the fred meyer merger 
we are required to make the remaining million contribution by may items affecting interest expense we adopted sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  in the first quarter of as a result  expenses related to the early retirement of debt  which were recorded as extraordinary items prior to the issuance of sfas no 
 are now classified as interest expense in the respective periods 
the expenses of million pre tax  related to a premium paid in connection with the redemption of our million bonds due march  net of the effect of reduced interest expense for the balance of the year 
the expenses of million  pre tax  related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of million of long term bonds  and the write off of the related deferred financing costs 
goodwill impairment charge we performed the annual evaluation of goodwill required by sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of this review resulted in a million non cash impairment charge related to goodwill at our ralphs and food less divisions 
the impairment charge  most of which is non deductible for income tax purposes  adjusted the carrying value of the divisions goodwill to its implied fair value 
the divisions operating performance suffered due to the intense competitive environment following the southern california labor dispute and recovery period 
the decreased operating performance was the result of the investments in personnel  training  capital and price reductions necessary to regain ralphs lost business and to maintain business gained by food less stores that were not subject to the labor dispute 
as a result of this decline in operating performance  the divisions carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value resulting in the impairment charge 
no impairment for goodwill at our other divisions was indicated during this review 
during our annual review in  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge related to the goodwill at our smith s division following a substantial decline in the operating performance of the division compared to operating performance and expected future performance 
asset impairment charges and related items in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets  we recorded impairment losses for both assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used during these losses  which are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as asset impairment charges  totaled million  pre tax 
the impairment review was conducted as a consequence of a corporate level strategic plan that coordinated the closing of several locations over a relatively short period of time as a result of deteriorating operating performance 
during the fourth quarter of  we authorized closure of several stores throughout the country based on operating results for and  as well as updated projections for and beyond 
this event triggered an impairment review of stores slated for closure as well as several other under performing locations in the fourth quarter of these charges are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges on december   we outlined our strategic growth plan the plan to support additional investment in our core business to increase sales and market share 
restructuring charges related to the plan totaled million  pre tax in the majority of the charge related to severance agreements  distribution center consolidation and conversion costs 
no restructuring charges were recorded in and merger related costs during  we recorded pre tax expenses of million from the issuance of restricted stock and the related market value adjustments 
the restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the fred meyer merger 
no merger related costs were recorded during or please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional details of this charge 
cumulative effect of an accounting change we adopted sfas no 
on february  the transitional impairment review required by sfas no 
resulted in a million pre tax  non cash loss to write off the goodwill at our jewelry store division based on its implied fair value 
impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and a review of the projected cash flows on a discounted basis  rather than an undiscounted basis  as was the standard under sfas no 
 prior to the adoption of sfas no 
we recorded this loss as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  net of a million tax benefit  in the first quarter of estimated effect of labor disputes the following table summarizes the estimated effect of labor disputes on kroger s financial results 
these items should not be considered alternatives to net earnings  net cash provided by operating activities or any other gaap measure of performance or liquidity 
these items should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for kroger s results as reported in accordance with gaap 
due to the nature of these items  as described below  it is important to identify the items and review them in conjunction with kroger s financial results reported in accordance with gaap 
for the dispute affected regions  we compared actual results to budgeted results from the start of the disputes through the first two quarters of in establishing budgets for  we took into account trends existing in the market prior to the labor disputes as well as changes in our business plan strategies 
based on those budgets  the estimated effects included the difference between reported sales and sales projections less reported merchandising costs and merchandising cost projections and the difference between reported og a and og a projections 
while we have relied on the accuracy of our budgets  significant amounts of judgment were used to develop those budgets and actual results  had there been no labor disputes  may have differed from those budgets 
included in the estimated effect of labor disputes were charges and credits that were recorded as components of merchandise costs and og a expense 
the calculation includes the effect of both the southern california and west virginia strikes 
the estimated effect includes all costs associated with the work stoppages  including expenses under the mutual strike assistance agreement in southern california entered into with safeway  inc and albertson s  inc  and post strike recovery expenses through the second quarter of in the third quarter of  we discontinued reporting the estimated strike effect for southern california 
in millions except per share amounts estimated effect of labor disputes on fifo gross margin og a total pre tax loss income tax effect total after tax loss shares estimated loss per share fifo gross margin is defined above in results of operations 
differences affecting fifo gross margin included incremental warehousing  distribution  advertising and inventory shrinkage expenses incurred during the labor dispute  as well as the investment in fifo gross margin  through targeted price reductions  and advertising in order to regain our sales during the post strike recovery period 
differences in og a included costs associated with hiring and training replacement workers  costs associated with bringing in employees from other kroger divisions to work on a temporary basis  expenses under the mutual strike assistance agreement and costs related to hiring and training workers to replace associates who did not return to work after the labor disputes ended 
common stock repurchase program in december  we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans 
this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises  including the tax benefit from these exercises 
we repurchased approximately million  million and million under the stock option program in during  and  respectively 
on december   kroger s board of directors the board authorized an additional stock repurchase program totaling million 
we made open market purchases totaling million and million under this plan in and during fiscal  we made open market purchases of approximately million to complete the program 
in september  the board authorized a new million stock repurchase program to replace the december program 
as of january   we had made purchases totaling million under the september program 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in the decline in was the result of our emphasis on the tightening of capital and increasing our focus on remodels  merchandising and productivity projects 
capital expenditure included million and million in and  respectively  related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease 
the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage supermarket storing activity beginning of year opened opened relocation acquired acquired relocation closed operational closed relocation end of year total food store square footage in millions critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims 
the liabilities represent our best estimate  using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods  of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january  case reserves are established for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as information becomes known 
the liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate 
the difference between the discounted and undiscounted workers compensation liabilities was million as of january  we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 
the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability  which can affect the liability recorded for such claims 
for example  variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized 
similarly  changes in legal trends and interpretations  as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
impairments of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred 
these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
when a trigger event occurs  an impairment calculation is performed  comparing projected undiscounted cash flows  utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores  to the carrying value for those stores 
if impairment is identified for long lived assets to be held and used  we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset s current carrying value 
we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows 
with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal  the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value  reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 
the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows 
our cash flow projections project several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation  the economy and market competition 
we perform impairment reviews at both the division and corporate levels 
generally  for reviews performed by local management  costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as operating  general and administrative expense 
costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets that result from corporate level strategic plans are separately identified in the consolidated statements of earnings as asset impairment charges 
refer to other items for a description of asset impairment charges recorded during goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also upon the occurrence of trigger events 
the reviews are performed at the operating division level 
generally  fair value represents a multiple of earnings  or discounted projected future cash flows  and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment 
projected future cash flows are based on management s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future 
if potential for impairment is identified  the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the division s goodwill 
goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division s goodwill over the implied fair value 
results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during  and are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results 
similar to our policy on impairment of long lived assets  the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation  the economy and market competition 
intangible assets in addition to goodwill  the company has recorded intangible assets totaling million and million for liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription file purchases  respectively  at january  balances at january   were million for liquor licenses and million for pharmacy prescription files 
owned liquor licenses are not amortized  while liquor licenses that must be renewed are amortized over their useful life 
pharmacy prescription file purchases are amortized over seven years 
we test these assets annually for impairment 
store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores 
the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores  which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years 
adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known 
store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs  or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose  is adjusted to income in the proper period 
we estimate subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
however  the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets  inflation rates and general economic conditions 
owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
costs to reduce the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets 
inventory write downs  if any  in connection with store closings  are classified in merchandise costs 
costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred 
post retirement benefit plans a company sponsored pension plans the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability 
the discount rate is based primarily on the yield on high quality fixed income investments as of the measurement date 
we lowered the discount rate to as of january   from as of january  the basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the projected pension benefit obligation as of january   by million 
in  we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by million as a result of this change 
to determine the expected return on pension plan assets  we contemplate current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories 
for  we assumed a pension return rate of  consistent with our pension plan s average return was for the calendar years ended december   net of all investment management fees and expenses 
we believe the pension return assumption is appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return 
in addition to the million we contributed in and the million we contributed in  we are required to make cash contributions totaling million to our company sponsored pension plan during fiscal we may make additional contributions during in order to maintain our desired funding status 
we expect any additional contributions during will decrease our required contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
b multi employer plans we also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements 
these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose 
trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions 
the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 
we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded  in accordance with gaap 
we made contributions to these plans  and recognized expense  of million in  million in  and million in we estimate we would have contributed an additional million in and million in  but our obligation to contribute was suspended during the labor disputes 
based on the most recent information available to us  we believe that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits 
we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets  ie  the amount of underfunding  as of december  because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans  we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger s share of the underfunding 
as of december   we estimate that kroger s share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which kroger contributes was to billion  pre tax 
our estimate is based on actuarial evaluations and other data which  itself  includes estimates 
our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable 
we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger 
rather  we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences 
we expect our contributions to these multi employer plans will continue to increase each year  and therefore the expense we recognize under gaap will increase 
we expect our contributions in will increase approximately percent  and we expect that amount to increase by about five percent each year thereafter 
the amount of increases in and beyond has been favorably affected by the labor agreements negotiated in southern california and elsewhere during and by related trustee actions 
although underfunding can result in the imposition of excise taxes on contributing employers  increased contributions can reduce underfunding so that excise taxes are not triggered 
our estimate of future contribution increases takes into account the avoidance of those taxes 
finally  underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds  we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability 
any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with gaap 
the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and is disclosed for the purpose described 
the amount could decline  and kroger s future expense would be favorably affected  if the values of net assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining  trustee action or favorable legislation 
on the other hand  kroger s share of the underfunding would increase and kroger s future expense could be adversely affected if net asset values decline  or if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining  trustee action or adverse legislation 
deferred rent we recognize rent holidays  including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements  as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
tax contingencies various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  we record allowances for probable exposures 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an allowance  is audited and fully resolved 
as of january   tax years to were undergoing examination by the internal revenue service 
the establishment of our tax contingency allowances relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes those estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results could differ  resulting in gains or losses that may be material to our consolidated statements of operations 
to the extent the we prevail in matters for which allowances have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of these allowances  our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
stock option plans we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
accordingly  because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date  no stock based compensation expense is included in net earnings  other than expenses related to restricted stock awards 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards  consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market 
in total  approximately of inventories for and  respectively  were valued using the lifo method 
cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by million at january   and by million at january  we follow the link chain  dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 
the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment is followed for substantially all non perishable store inventories and some perishable departments at our supermarket divisions 
this method involves counting each item in inventory  assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold 
the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 
we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities 
we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow information net cash provided by operating activities we generated  million of cash from operations in compared to  million in and  million in changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the net amount of cash provided by our operating activities 
during  we realized a million increase in operating assets and liabilities compared to a million increase during and a million reduction during fluctuations in our accounts payable balances and store deposit in transit balances contributed to the changes in operating assets and liabilities in and the increase in our store deposits in transit balances in was primarily related to our decision to discontinue the practice of transferring deposits to our concentration account prior to receiving credit for those deposits from other banks 
offsetting the changes in our store deposits in transit balances  our other current liabilities increased in as a result of the labor disputes discussed in estimated effect of labor disputes 
in  our accounts payable balances increased substantially due to an enterprise systems conversion that enabled our western divisions to improve their accounts payable position 
the amount of cash paid for income taxes in was higher than the amount paid in due primarily to higher earnings before the effect of goodwill impairment charges 
in addition  the bonus depreciation provision  which expired in december reduced our cash taxes in  and  and we expect the cash benefit will reverse in this provision reduced our cash taxes by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our and operating cash flow results also reflect cash contributions totaling million and million  respectively  to our company sponsored pension plan 
net cash used by investing activities cash used by investing activities was  million in  compared to  million in and  million in the amount of cash used by investing activities in decreased from and due to reduced capital expenditures 
net cash used by financing activities financing activities used million of cash in  compared to million in and  million in the increase in cash used by financing in compared to was primarily related to the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt 
the decrease in the use of cash in versus was due primarily to a reduction in the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt and to a reduction in treasury stock purchases 
the decreased use of cash was also due to increases in book overdrafts in versus as well as to proceeds received in from interest rate swap terminations 
debt management total debt  including both the current and long term portions of capital leases  decreased million to billion as of year end from billion as of year end total debt decreased million to billion as of year end from billion as of year end the decreases were primarily the result of using cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt 
approximately million of the decrease experienced in resulted from the consolidation of a financing entity 
our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt  pursuant to sfas no 
we had prefunded employee benefit costs of million at year end  and the mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by million  million and million as of year end  and  respectively 
factors affecting liquidity we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately million to million under our a p f rated commercial paper cp program 
these borrowings are backed by our credit facilities  and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities 
we have capacity available under our credit facilities to backstop all cp amounts outstanding 
if our credit rating declined below its current level of bbb baa bbb  the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating 
this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities  under which we believe we have sufficient capacity 
borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program  depending on the current interest rate environment 
however  in the event of a ratings decline  we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie  in excess of days 
although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating  the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio 
on march   standard poor s ratings services placed its ratings for kroger  as well as safeway inc and albertson s  inc  on creditwatch with negative implications 
standard poor s indicated they expect any downgrade  if warranted by their review  should be limited to one level  with ratings not expected to fall below investment grade 
our credit facilities also require the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants 
a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facilities 
these financial covenants and ratios are described below our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense  as defined in the credit facilities was to as of january  if this ratio declined to below to  the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would increase at least 
the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would be similarly impacted by a one level downgrade in our credit rating 
our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit facilities was to as of january  if this ratio exceeded to  we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired 
our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense  as defined in the credit facilities was to as of january  if this ratio fell below to  we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired 
consolidated ebitda  as defined in our credit facilities  includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses 
our credit agreements are more particularly described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of january  in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations charitable contributions minimum contributions to company sponsored pension plan low income housing obligations financed lease obligations construction commitments purchase obligations total other commercial commitments credit facilities standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of january  applicable to the company s variable interest debt instruments  excluding commercial paper borrowings due to the short term nature of these borrowings  and stated fixed interest rates for all other debt instruments 
these borrowings are currently in the form of short term commercial paper and are also included in the long term debt contractual obligation amount 
they are considered long term because the company expects that these borrowings will be refinanced by the same type of securities 
they are scheduled as due in the year of maturity of the existing credit facilities 
we are required to make cash contributions totaling million to our company sponsored pension plans during fiscal we may make additional contributions to these plans in order to maintain our desired funding status 
we expect any additional contributions made during will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
at this time  it is not reasonably practicable to estimate contribution amounts for and beyond 
our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction 
these amounts are reflected in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets 
our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business  such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities 
our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties 
any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of january   we maintained a five year revolving credit facility totaling billion  which terminates in in addition  we maintained a million five year credit facility that terminates in outstanding borrowings under the credit agreements and commercial paper borrowings  and some outstanding letters of credit  reduce funds available under the credit facilities 
in addition to the credit facilities  we maintain a million money market line  borrowings under which also reduce the funds available under our credit facilities 
as of january   our outstanding credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings totaled million 
we had no borrowings under the money market line as of january  the outstanding letters of credit that reduced the funds available under our credit facilities totaled million as of january  we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis  and have presented the amounts accordingly 
the money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates  usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements 
at january   we also had a million pharmacy receivable securitization facility that provided capacity incremental to the billion described above 
funds received under this million facility do not reduce funds available under the credit facilities 
collection rights to some of our pharmacy accounts receivable balances are sold to initiate the drawing of funds under the facility 
as of january   we had no borrowings under this million facility 
in addition to the available credit mentioned above  as of january   we had available for issuance billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and declared effective on december we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured insurance costs 
these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and general liability exposures  and are made with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments 
these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger  as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs 
however  we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place 
market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and  in some instances  availability of these bonds may become more limited  which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds 
although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds  if this does become an issue  we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements 
this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facilities 
most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co 
and some of its subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements 
in addition  we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of four real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with ownership 
our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness  should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations  totals approximately million 
based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january   it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 
we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available to us  we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses  including pension trust fund withdrawal liabilities 
in addition to the above  the company enters into various indemnification agreements and takes on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business 
such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to the company  indemnities related to the sale of company securities  indemnities of directors  officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work  and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans 
while the company s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability  the company is aware of no current matter that it expects to result in a material liability recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp no 
supersedes fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  and provides guidance on the accounting  disclosure and transition related to the prescription drug act 
fsp no 
became effective for the third quarter of the adoption of fsp no 
had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
detailed regulations in this area continue to evolve that could have an effect on the company going forward  which effect we do not expect to be material 
in december  the fasb issued fsp no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction of qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  which provides accounting and disclosure guidance on the act s qualified production activities deduction 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its effective tax rate for and subsequent periods 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
and related interpretation and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are similar to those of sfas no 
 however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant 
fair value of share based awards will be determined using option price models eg black scholes or binomial models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards 
compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of and expect it will reduce net earnings by to per diluted share for fiscal in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter which clarifies that inventory costs that are abnormal are required to be charged to expense as incurred as opposed to being capitalized into inventory as a product cost 
sfas no 
provides examples of abnormal costs to included costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs and spoilage 
sfas no 
will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations was issued by the fasb in march fin provides guidance relating to the identification of and financial reporting for legal obligations to perform an asset retirement activity 
the interpretation requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  we do not expect adoption of fin to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about kroger s future performance 
these statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available 
such statements relate to  among other things projected change in net earnings  identical sales growth  expected pension plan contributions  our ability to generate operating cash flow  projected capital expenditures  square footage growth  opportunities to reduce costs  cash flow requirements  and our operating plan for the future  and are indicated by words such as comfortable  committed  expect  goal  should  intend  target  believe  anticipate  and similar words or phrases 
these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations  projections  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties about the general economy  our labor relations  our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 
we expect net earnings in to exceed per diluted share 
we expect identical food store sales growth  including southern california and excluding fuel sales  to exceed in we plan to use one third of cash flow for debt reduction and two thirds for stock repurchase or payment of a cash dividend 
we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition  as well as focusing on productivity increase from our existing store base through remodels 
in addition  we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate  logistics and technology improvements 
the continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations  logistics  manufacturing procurement  category management  merchandising and buying practices  and should reduce merchandising costs 
we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements 
we expect capital investment for to be in the range of billion  excluding acquisitions 
total food store square footage is expected to grow at before acquisitions and operational closings 
based on current operating trends  we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities  will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future 
we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
we expect that our og a results will be affected by increased costs  such as health care benefit costs  pension costs and credit card fees  as well as any future labor disputes  offset by improved productivity from process changes  cost savings negotiated in recently completed labor agreements and sales leverage 
we expect rent expense  as a percent of total sales and excluding closed store activity  will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate 
we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately we will continue to evaluate under performing stores 
we anticipate operational closings will continue at an above historical rate 
we believe that in there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration  labor  shrink  warehousing and transportation 
these savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers 
in addition to the million and million contributed to company sponsored pension plans in and  respectively  we are required to make cash contributions totaling million during fiscal we may make additional contributions during in order to maintain our desired funding levels 
we expect the additional contributions made during will reduce our contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
we expect our contributions in to increase approximately twenty percent over the million contributed in we expect our contributions to these plans to increase by about five percent each year for each year thereafter 
various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals 
these include in  we have major ufcw contracts expiring in atlanta  columbus 
dallas  portland non food  roanoke 
teamsters contracts in southern california and one that covers several facilities in the midwest also expire 
in all of these contracts  rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations 
a prolonged work stoppage at a substantial number of stores could have a material effect on our results 
our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals  for the entire company and southern california in particular  may be affected by labor disputes  industry consolidation  pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors  including non traditional competitors  our response to these actions  the state of the economy  including the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities  stock repurchases  and the success of our future growth plans 
in addition to the factors identified above  our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales  the effect of our sister stores new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store and reductions in retail pricing 
we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business and believe we have made adequate provisions for them where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where we believe an adverse outcome is probable 
unexpected outcomes in these matters  however  could result in an adverse effect on our earnings 
the proportion of cash flow used to reduce outstanding debt  repurchase common stock or pay a cash dividend may be affected by the amount of outstanding debt available for pre payments  changes in borrowing rates and the market price of kroger common stock 
consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business  either favorable or unfavorable  cannot be foreseen 
rent expense  which includes subtenant rental income  could be adversely affected by the state of the economy  increased store closure activity and future consolidation 
depreciation expense  which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases  is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets  or the remaining terms of leases 
use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed 
our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws  the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses 
we believe the multi employer pension funds to which we contribute are substantially underfunded  and we believe the effect of that underfunding will be the increased contributions we have projected over the next several years 
should asset values in these funds deteriorate  or if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability  or should our estimates prove to be understated  our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated 
the grocery retail industry continues to experience fierce competition from other traditional food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers  club or warehouse stores  drug stores and restaurants 
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and to reduce operating expenses  including managing health care and pension costs contained in our collective bargaining agreements 
the competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales  thus reducing margins 
while we believe our opportunities for sustained profitable growth are considerable  unanticipated actions of competitors could adversely affect our sales 
changes in laws or regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements 
changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  including the rate of inflation  population growth and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate  may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores 
this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth 
general economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers  which could affect sales and earnings 
changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators 
for example  we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base 
since gasoline generates low profit margins  including generating decreased margins as the market price increases  we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase 
although this negatively affects our fifo gross margin  gasoline sales provide a positive effect on operating  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales 
our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired  and achieve operating improvements at those companies  will affect our operations 
our capital expenditures could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores  if development costs vary from those budgeted or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget 
interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment  changes in the company s credit ratings  fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt  decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely impacts our operations that results in an increase in debt 
adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products  or may decrease the customer demand for certain products 
additionally  increases in the cost of inputs  such as utility costs or raw material costs  could negatively impact financial ratios and earnings 
although we presently operate only in the united states  civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods 
if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers  our fifo gross margin and net earnings will suffer 
we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on kroger s business 
we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly for other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information 
accordingly  actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in  contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt  and interest rate swaps 
our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates 
to do this  we use the following guidelines i use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure  ii limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of billion or less  iii include no leveraged products  and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
as of january   we maintained ten interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling approximately  million  to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates 
these agreements mature at varying times between july and january variable rates for our agreements are based on us dollar london interbank offered rate libor 
the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
these agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 
all interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges 
as of january   liabilities totaling million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements  offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying debt 
during  we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that were accounted for as fair value hedges 
approximately million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations were recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt 
as of january   the unamortized balances totaled approximately annually  we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines 
the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of january  the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases  and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of january  interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments 
the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january  the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of january  refer to notes  and to the consolidated financial statements expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate average notional amounts outstanding thereafter total fair value in millions interest rate derivatives variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources  including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business 
those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales 
for any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and  as a result  will require net settlement  the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 
some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging 
we sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into six derivative instruments to protect us from declining corrugated cardboard prices 
the derivatives  accounted for as cash flow hedges  contain a three year term 
none of the contracts  either individually or in the aggregate  hedge more than of our expected corrugated cardboard sales 
as of january   a liability totaling million had been recorded for the instruments 
corresponding charges were recorded as other comprehensive loss  net of income tax effects
