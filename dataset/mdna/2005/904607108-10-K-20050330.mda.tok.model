reinsurance a reinsurance transaction occurs when an insurance company transfers cedes a portion of its exposure on business written by it to a reinsurer that assumes that risk for a premium ceded premium 
reinsurance does not legally discharge the company from primary liability under its policies

m best rating a 
in  crusader had its primary excess of loss reinsurance agreements with general reinsurance corporation am best rating a 
crusader also has catastrophe reinsurance from various highly rated california admitted and bermuda reinsurance companies 
these reinsurance agreements help protect crusader against liabilities in excess of certain retentions  including major or catastrophic losses that may occur from any one or more of the property and or casualty risks which crusader insures 
the company has no reinsurance recoverable balances in dispute 
the aggregate amount of earned premium ceded to the reinsurers was  for the fiscal year ended december   and  for the fiscal year ended december  on july   crusader increased its retention from  to  per risk 
concurrently  crusader maintained catastrophe and clash covers subject to a maximum occurrence and annual aggregate to help protect the company from one loss occurrence affecting multiple policies 
beginning january   an annual aggregate deductible of  commenced on losses ceded to its reinsurance treaty covering losses between  and  on january   the annual aggregate deductible decreased to  on january   it increased to  on january   it decreased to  and remained as such for the fiscal year

in crusader retained a participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of in its st layer  in excess of  in its nd layer  in excess of  and in its property clash treaty 
prior to january   national reinsurance corporation acquired by general reinsurance corporation in charged a provisional rate on exposures up to  that was subject to adjustment and was based on the amount of losses ceded  limited by a maximum percentage that could be charged 
that provisionally rated treaty was cancelled on a runoff basis and replaced by a flat rated treaty on january  crusader s and st layer primary excess of loss treaty provides for a contingent commission equal to of the net profit  if any  accruing to the reinsurer 
the first accounting period for the contingent commission is december  based on losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded including incurred but not reported losses as of december   no contingent commission has been accrued 
beginning january   crusader increased its retention from  to  per risk 
there has been no change in the annual aggregate deductible or participation rates compared to the st layer primary excess of loss treaty does not provide for a contingent commission 
on most of the premium that crusader cedes to the reinsurer  the reinsurer pays a commission to crusader that includes a reimbursement of the cost of acquiring the portion of the premium that is ceded 
crusader does not currently assume any reinsurance 
the company intends to continue obtaining reinsurance although the availability and cost may vary from time to time 
the unpaid losses ceded to the reinsurer are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses crusader maintains reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to both reported and unreported losses 
when a claim for loss is reported to the company  a reserve is established for the expected cost to settle the claim  including estimates of any related legal expense and other costs associated with resolving the claim 
these reserves are called case based reserves 
in addition  the company also sets up reserves at the end of each reporting period for losses that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the company 
these incurred but not reported losses are referred to as ibnr reserves 
crusader establishes reserves for reported losses based on historical experience  upon case by case evaluation of facts surrounding each known loss  and the related policy provisions 
the amount of reserves for unreported losses is estimated by analysis of historical and statistical information 
the ultimate liability of crusader may be greater or less than estimated reserves 
reserves are monitored and adjusted when appropriate and are reflected in the statement of operations in the period of adjustment 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated to cover the future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred 
the process of establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves involves significant judgment 
the following table shows the development of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for fiscal years through the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses for losses arising in the current and prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date 
the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate is increased or decreased  as more information becomes known 
the table reflects redundancies and deficiencies in crusader s net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
as of december   all periods stated in the table prior to reflected a cumulative deficiency 
the period reflects an  redundancy in crusader s net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
see discussion of losses and loss adjustment expenses in item management s discussion and analysis results of operations insurance company operation 
crusader is a relatively small insurance company 
crusader is constantly changing its product mix and exposures  including the types of businesses insured within its business package program 
considering the uncertainties from this changing environment  the company recognizes the difficulties in developing its own unique reserving statistics  therefore  it incorporates industry standards and averages into its estimates 
the company believes that its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are properly stated 
when subsequent loss and loss adjustment expense development justifies changes in reserving practices  the company acts accordingly 
when evaluating the information in the following table  it should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts of prior periods  therefore  the cumulative redundancy or deficiency represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
conditions and trends that have affected development of liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future deficiencies or redundancies based on this table

since each property and casualty insurance company has different capital needs  an acceptable ratio of net premium written to policyholders surplus for one company may be inapplicable to another 
while there is no statutory requirement applicable to crusader that establishes a permissible net premium to surplus ratio  guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners naic provide that such ratio should generally be no greater than to twelve months ended december statutory net premiums written      policyholders surplus      ratio to to to to to crusader results are reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
these results differ from its financial results reported in accordance with statutory accounting principles sap as prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities 
crusader is required to file financial statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on a sap basis 
sap differs in certain respects from gaap 
the more significant of these differences that apply to crusader are policy acquisition costs such as commissions  premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing new and renewal business are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premiums are earned  rather than expensed as incurred as required by sap 
certain assets included in balance sheets under gaap are designated as non admitted assets and are charged directly against statutory surplus under sap 
non admitted assets include primarily premium receivables that are outstanding over days  federal deferred tax assets in excess of statutory limitations  furniture  equipment  leasehold improvements and prepaid expenses 
amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross as prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance recoverable  rather than netted against unearned premium reserves and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  respectively  as required by sap 
fixed maturity securities  which are classified as available for sale  are reported at current market values  rather than at amortized cost  or the lower of amortized cost or market  depending on the specific type of security as required by sap 
the differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense 
under gaap reporting  changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense 
as required by sap  federal income taxes are recorded when payable and deferred taxes  subject to limitations  are recognized but only to the extent that they do not exceed of statutory surplus 
changes in deferred taxes are recorded directly to statutory surplus 
regulation the insurance company operation is subject to regulation by the california department of insurance the insurance department and by the department of insurance of other states in which crusader is licensed 
the insurance department has broad regulatory  supervisory  and administrative powers 
these powers relate primarily to the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the nature and limitation of insurers investments  the prior approval of rates  rules and forms  the issuance of securities by insurers  periodic financial and market conduct examinations of the affairs of insurers  the annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition and results of operations of such insurers or for other purposes  and the establishment of reserves required to be maintained for unearned premiums  losses  and other purposes 
the regulations and supervision by the insurance department are designed principally for the benefit of policyholders and not for the insurance company shareholders 
the insurance department s market conduct division is responsible for conducting periodic examinations of companies to ensure compliance with california insurance code and california code of regulations with respect to rating  underwriting and claims handling practices 
the most recent examination of crusader covered underwriting and rating practices for the period january   through june  the report on the results of that examination was issued on september  as of december   the company believes that there are no outstanding criticisms arising from that report 
the insurance department also conducts periodic financial examinations of crusader 
the insurance department has completed its financial examination of crusader s december   statutory financial statements 
the report of examination that was filed with the insurance department on may   reported no adjustments to crusader s statutory financial statements 
in december  the naic adopted a risk based capital rbc model law for property and casualty companies 
the rbc model law is intended to provide standards for calculating a variable regulatory capital requirement related to a company s current operations and its risk exposures asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk and off balance sheet risk 
these standards are intended to serve as a diagnostic solvency tool for regulators that establishes uniform capital levels and specific authority levels for regulatory intervention when an insurer falls below minimum capital levels 
the rbc model law specifies four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over a domestic insurer if its rbc is equal to or less than of its computed authorized control level rbc 
a company s rbc is required to be disclosed in its statutory annual statement 
the rbc is not intended to be used as a rating or ranking tool nor is it to be used in premium rate making or approval 
crusader s adjusted capital at december   was of authorized control level risk based capital 
the following table sets forth the different levels of risk based capital that may trigger regulatory involvement and the corresponding actions that may result 
level trigger corrective action company action level adjusted capital less than the insurer must submit a comprehensive plan to the of authorized control level insurance commissioner regulatory action level adjusted capital less than in addition to above  insurer is subject to examination  of authorized control level analysis and specific corrective action authorized control level adjusted capital less than in addition to both of the above  insurance commissioner of authorized control level may place insurer under regulatory control mandatory control level adjusted capital less than insurer must be placed under regulatory control of authorized control level insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
iris helps those companies that merit highest priority in the allocation of the regulators resources on the basis of financial ratios that are calculated annually 
the analytical phase is a review of annual statements and the financial ratios 
the ratios and trends are valuable in pointing to companies likely to experience financial difficulties  but are not themselves indicative of adverse financial condition 
the ratio and benchmark comparisons are mechanically produced and are not intended to replace the state insurance departments own in depth financial analysis or on site examinations 
an unusual range of ratio results has been established from studies of the ratios of companies that have become insolvent or have experienced financial difficulties 
in the analytical phase  companies that receive four or more financial ratio values outside the usual range are analyzed in order to identify those companies that appear to require immediate regulatory action 
subsequently  a more comprehensive review of the ratio results and an insurer s annual statement is performed to confirm that an insurer s situation calls for increased or close regulatory attention 
in  the company was outside the usual values on two of the twelve iris ratio tests 
these ratios were the estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus ratio and the investment yield ratio 
the estimated current reserve deficiency to surplus ratio was outside the usual values due to adverse development of the company s losses and loss adjustment expense reserves in and the investment yield ratio compares the company s investment yield of to an established minimum and maximum range of greater than and less than 
the decrease in the company s investment yield is primarily the result of a decline over the last years in short and long term yields in the marketplace and a shorter weighted average maturity of the portfolio 
due to the interest rate environment  management believed it was prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with shorter maturities with minimal credit risk 
california insurance guarantee association the california insurance guarantee association ciga was created to provide for payment of claims for which insolvent insurers of most casualty lines are liable but which cannot be paid out of such insurers assets 
the company is subject to assessment by ciga for its pro rata share of such claims based on premiums written in the particular line in the year preceding the assessment by insurers writing that line of insurance in california 
such assessments are based upon estimates of losses to be incurred in liquidating an insolvent insurer 
in a particular year  the company cannot be assessed an amount greater than of its premiums written in the preceding year 
assessments are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders the year after the assessment 
during  the company paid  that was assessed by ciga 
for premiums written in net of cancellations  the company recovered assessments from policyholders in the amount of  during the company remitted an additional amount of  which exceeded the amount recouped from policyholders by  the excess amount remitted to ciga will be recovered from ciga in no assessment was made by ciga for the or the calendar year 
holding company act crusader is subject to regulation by the insurance department pursuant to the provisions of the california insurance holding company system regulatory act the holding company act 
pursuant to the holding company act  the insurance department may examine the affairs of crusader at any time 
certain transactions defined to be of an extraordinary type may not be effected without the prior approval of the insurance department 
such transactions include  but are not limited to  sales  purchases  exchanges  loans and extensions of credit  and investments made within the immediately preceding months involving the lesser of of admitted assets or of policyholders surplus  as of the preceding december an extraordinary transaction also includes a dividend which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s policyholders surplus as of the preceding december or the insurance company s net income for the preceding calendar year 
an insurance company is also required to notify the insurance department of any dividend after declaration  but prior to payment 
the holding company act also provides that the acquisition or change of control of a california domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the insurance commissioner 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities  which in the aggregate constitute or more of the voting securities of a california insurance company or a person who controls a california insurance company  such as crusader 
a person seeking to acquire control  directly or indirectly  of the company must generally file with the insurance commissioner an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the company 
the holding company act also effectively restricts the company from consummating certain reorganization or mergers without prior regulatory approval 
the company is in compliance with the holding company act 
rating insurance companies are rated to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers with meaningful information on specific insurance companies 
higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims 
these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors 
such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time 
ratings focus primarily on the following factors capital resources  financial strength  demonstrated management expertise in the insurance business  credit analysis  systems development  market segment position and growth opportunities  marketing  sales conduct practices  investment operations  minimum policyholders surplus requirements and capital sufficiency to meet projected growth  as well as access to such traditional capital as may be necessary to continue to meet standards for capital adequacy 
the claims paying abilities of insurers are rated to provide both insurance consumers and industry participants with comparative information on specific insurance companies 
claims paying ratings are important for the marketing of certain insurance products 
a higher rating generally indicates greater financial strength and a stronger ability to pay claims 
primarily as a result of the underwriting losses in and  the am best company lowered crusader s rating from a excellent to a excellent effective march   based on financial information as of december  at the time the rating was lowered  am best remained concerned with the potential for further adverse loss reserve development and the negative impact it would have on the company s operating performance and overall capitalization and viewed the rating outlook as negative 
due to the continued adverse development in the six months ended june   on october   am best company lowered crusader s rating to b very good 
the lowering of crusader s rating to b did not have a materially adverse effect on the company 
the company is currently rated b with a rating outlook as negative 
terrorism risk insurance act of on november   the terrorism risk insurance act of the act was signed by president bush 
the act establishes a program within the department of the treasury in which the federal government will share the risk of loss from acts of terrorism with the insurance industry 
federal participation will be triggered when the secretary of the treasury  in concurrence with the secretary of state and the attorney general of the united states  certifies an act to be an act of terrorism committed by an individual s acting on behalf of any foreign interest  provided the terrorist act results in aggregate losses in excess of million 
under the act  the federal government will pay of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible 
all property and casualty insurance companies are required to participate in the program to the extent that they must make available property and casualty insurance coverage for terrorism that does not differ materially from the terms  amounts  and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism 
the company does not write policies on properties considered to be a target of terrorist activities such as airports  hotels  large office structures  amusement parks  landmark defined structures  or other public facilities 
in addition  there is not a high concentration of policies in any one area where increased exposure to terrorist threats exist

in crusader received  in terrorism coverage premium from approximately of its policyholders 
crusader s terrorism deductible was  crusader s terrorism deductible is  california department of insurance on october   the california insurance commissioner proposed regulations that require greater disclosure of the commissions that brokers may receive from insurance companies for selling insurance policies 
the proposed regulations are designed to protect consumers from undisclosed commissions and would penalize any broker who places his or her own financial or other interest above that of a client 
under the proposed regulations  brokers and agents would be required to disclose all material facts regarding third party compensation

competition general the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive in the areas of price and service 
it is highly cyclical  characterized by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
the profitability of insurers is affected by many factors including rate competition  the frequency of claims and their average cost  natural disasters  state regulations  interest rates  crime rates  general business conditions  and court decisions redefining and expanding the extent of coverage and granting higher compensation awards 
one of the challenging and unique features of the property and casualty business is the fact that  since premiums are collected before losses are paid  its products are normally priced before its costs are known 
insurance company and general agency operations property and casualty the company s property and casualty insurance business continues to experience a competitive marketplace 
there are many substantial competitors who have larger resources  operate in more states  and insure coverages in more lines and in higher limits than the company 
in addition  crusader competes not only with other insurance companies but also with the general agents 
many of these general agents offer more products than the company 
the principal method of competition among competitors is price

the company s remaining operations constitute a variety of specialty insurance services  each with unique characteristics and individually not material to consolidated revenues 
insurance company operation the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and includes many insurers  ranging from large companies offering a wide variety of products worldwide to smaller  specialized companies in a single state or region offering only a single product 
many of the company s existing or potential competitors have considerably greater financial and other resources  have a higher rating assigned by independent rating organizations such as am best company  have greater experience in the insurance industry and offer a broader line of insurance products than the company 
currently  crusader is writing primarily commercial multiple peril business only in the state of california and is rated b very good by am best company 
a primary challenge of the property and casualty insurance company operation is contending with the fact that the company sells its products before the ultimate costs are actually known 
when pricing its products  the company projects the ultimate claim and loss adjustment cost that it anticipates will be incurred after the policy is sold 
in addition  factors such as changes in  among other things  regulations  changes in the legal environment  and inflation can all impact the ultimate cost 
over the past few years  the insurance industry has seen some difficult times as a result of september  industry wide underwriting losses  decreases in investment yield  and increases in reinsurance cost that have all contributed to the change from a soft market to a hard market 
although the company increased its rates and adopted more restrictive underwriting guidelines  the beneficial market changes contributed to an increase in direct written premium in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the company s future writings and growth are dependent upon  among other things  market conditions  competition  and the company s ability to introduce new and profitable products 
the company believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth and that underwriting profit is the company s primary goal 
management s assessment of trends and underwriting results is a primary factor in its decisions to expand or contract its business 
in  primarily as a result of losses from liquor and premises liability coverages which had rendered much of the company s business outside of california unprofitable  the company began placing moratoriums on non california business on a state by state basis 
by july  the company had placed moratoriums on all non california business 
the company has no plan to expand into additional states or to expand its marketing channels 
instead  the company intends to allocate its resources toward improving its california business rates  rules  and forms 
the company incurred underwriting losses in   and as a result of these underwriting losses  management analyzed and acted upon various components of its underwriting activity 
the company believes that the implementation of these actions contributed to the improved underwriting results 
this is reflected in the decrease in the company s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premium from in  to in  to in  and to in the development of prior year losses was favorable in the amount of  as compared to  of adverse development of prior year losses in and  in the adverse development of prior year losses was substantially lower than  and the adverse development was primarily attributable to one claim 
other operations the company s other operations generate commissions  fees  and finance charges from various insurance products 
the events that have the most significant economic impact on other operations are as follows unifax primarily sells and services insurance policies for crusader 
the commissions paid by crusader to unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected as income in the financial statements 
as a result of a slight decrease in the number of policies sold by unifax during as compared to  policy fee income for the months ended december   decreased as compared to the prior year period 
aib sells and services health insurance policies for individual family and small business groups primarily for cigna healthcare cigna and receives commission and fee income based on the premiums that it writes 
commission and fee income in this program decreased in the year ended december   compared to the decrease is a result of cigna s decision to discontinue its individual family health insurance program over the period from november   through october  aib had been assisting former cigna policyholders to find health coverage with other insurance carriers that aib represents 
as such  aib s commission from all insurance carriers other than cigna increased approximately in as compared to aac provides premium financing for crusader policies that are produced by unifax in california 
finance charges and fees earned by aac during decreased as compared to the decrease is a result of a decrease in the number of loans issued in compared to  offset by a increase in the average premium financed from  in to  in investments and liquidity the company generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which consisted of approximately million at amortized cost at december   compared to million at amortized cost at december  although the portfolio increased in  investment income decreased approximately  the decrease in investment income is primarily the result of a decline over the last five years in short and long term yields in the marketplace and a shorter weighted average maturity of the portfolio 
due to the interest rate environment  management believed it was prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with shorter maturities with minimal credit risk 
primarily as a result of the company s growth in premiums in and  the company generated positive cash flows from operations  which was approximately million in and million in the increased cash flows from operations contributed to the increase in the company s investment portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of the company s business insurance and insurance services and whereas company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of profits into property or equipment  the cash flow generated from operations usually results in improved liquidity for the company 
because the company is a holding company and operates through its subsidiaries  its cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distributions of those earnings to the company 
the cash flow provided by operations in the year ended december   was  a decrease in cash flow of  compared to the cash flow for the year ending december  cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was  an increase of  in cash provided compared to the year ended december  the company has utilized the cash provided from operating activities and from the maturity of its long and short term investment primarily to purchase million of fixed maturity securities 
the most significant liquidity risk faced by the company would be adverse development of the insurance company claims  both reported and unreported 
the company has taken measures to address the underlying causes of prior adverse development  however  no assurance can be given that the measures taken will be successful or that the company s estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will be sufficient 
based on the company s current loss and loss expense reserves and expected current and future payments  the company believes that there are no current liquidity issues 
crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves  its reserves for loss payments  and its capital and surplus 
crusader s loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the company 
these payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the company has the liquidity to cover these payments without the need to liquidate its investments 
cash and investments excluding net unrealized gains or losses at december   were  compared to  at december   an increase 
crusader s cash and investments at december   was  or of the total held by the company  compared to  or of the total held by the company at december  the company s investments are as follows december  december  december  amount amount amount fixed maturities at amortized cost certificates of deposit    us treasury securities    us government sponsored enterprise securities    industrial and miscellaneous taxable    state and municipal tax exempt    total fixed maturity investments    short term cash investments at cost certificates of deposit    cash deposited in lieu of bond   commercial paper    bank money market accounts    us gov t obligation money market fund    short term us treasury  bank savings accounts    total short term cash investments    total investments    deposited with superior courts to stay execution of judgments pending appeal of two crusader claims 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company is required to classify its investment securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
although all of the company s investments are classified as available for sale and the company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions  its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
the tax exempt interest income earned net of bond premium and discount amortization during the year ended december   was  compared to  in the year ended december  in the year ended december   tax exempt interest income earned totaled  the company s investment policy limits investments in any one company to  and any one us government agency or us government sponsored enterprise to  this limitation excludes bond premiums paid in excess of par value and us government or us government guaranteed issues 
the company s investment guidelines on equity securities limit investments in equity securities to an aggregate maximum of  as of december   all of the company s fixed maturity investments were investment grade  the company held no non traded fixed maturity or equity securities  all state and municipal tax exempt fixed maturity investments were pre refunded issues  and all certificates of deposit were fdic insured 
in  unico made capital contributions totaling  to its crusader subsidiary 
the contributions were made to ensure that crusader maintained its am best financial size category vi rating  which requires capital of a least  the funding of unico s capital contribution to crusader was derived from available cash from the company s other operations and the proceeds of two notes 
on september   the company borrowed  from erwin cheldin  a director and the company s principal shareholder  president and chief executive officer  and  from the cary and danielle cheldin family trust

as of december   the company has purchased and retired under the board of directors authorization an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at a cost of  although material capital expenditures may also be funded through borrowings  the company believes that its cash and short term investments at year end  net of trust restriction of  statutory deposits of  cash deposited with superior courts in lieu of bond of  and dividend restriction between crusader and unico see item business insurance company operation holding company act plus the cash to be generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet its operating requirements during the next twelve months without the necessity of borrowing funds 
the company anticipates incurring approximately  of capital expenditures in for computer hardware and software related to its conversion to a paperless office 
this project is expected to be completed by mid the company s analysis of its potential return on this capital expenditure is estimated to be approximately two years due to anticipated productivity improvements and lower operating costs 
as a california insurance company  crusader is obligated to pay a premium tax on gross premiums written in all states that crusader is admitted 
premium taxes are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned 
the premium tax is in lieu of state franchise taxes and is not included in the provision for state taxes 
in the year ended december   the company recognized an income tax expense of  resulting from an assessment for the years and from the california franchise tax board 
the assessment resulted from a court ruling in ceridian vs 
franchise tax board that held that the california statute permitting the tax deductibility of dividends received from a wholly owned insurance subsidiary was unconstitutional because it discriminated against out of state holding companies and thus was in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the united states constitution 
the ruling concluded that the discriminatory sections of the statute are not severable and the entire statute was invalid and unenforceable 
california law provides that the proper remedy in such circumstances is to disallow the deduction to those taxpayers that benefited from the deduction 
as a result of the court ruling  in february  the franchise tax board ftb notified the company that it would issue a notice of proposed assessment npa for tax years and of approximately  representing california state franchise taxes plus related interest of approximately  in september  california enacted legislation ab that addresses many aspects of the tax treatment of insurance company owners  including holding companies such as unico 
the legislation provides for an election  applicable if made to all tax years ending after december   and before january   under which a dividend received deduction of up to of dividends paid by an insurer to a non insurer parent is allowed 
the company made the election authorized by ab and  therefore  has reversed of the  income tax expense 
the company has also reversed of the interest accrued at december   on the  assessment 
in addition  as a result of ab  the company recognized a state deferred tax liability of  in accordance with fasb this deferred tax liability represents the company s future state tax liability for all undistributed earnings of crusader since january  the federal tax benefit resulting from ab as of december   is  thus  the net deferred tax liability as of december   is  the company has certain obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments 
at december   certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related commitments are summarized as follows within after contractual obligations total year years years years building lease    notes payable related parties   losses and loss adjustment expense reserves      total      on january  the company repaid  in advance of the contractual due date of the note 
unlike many other forms of contractual obligations  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the total loss and loss adjustment expense reserve payments to be made by period  as shown above  are estimates 
results of operations general the company had a net income of  for the year ended december   compared to net income of  for the year ended december   and a net loss of  for the year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december for the year ended december   the company had income before taxes of  compared to income before taxes of  in the year ended december   an increase in income before taxes of  the increase in pre tax income was primarily due to an increase of  in the underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader offset by  decrease in gross commissions and fees income 
for the year ended december   the company had income before taxes of  compared to a loss before taxes of  in the year ended december   an increase in income before taxes of  the increase in pre tax income was primarily due to a decrease of  in the underwriting loss net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs from crusader 
the company had a net income for the year ended december   of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december   an increase in net earnings of the effect of inflation on the net income of the company during the years ended december    and was not significant 
the company derives revenue from various sources as discussed below 
insurance company operation premium and loss information of crusader are as follows year ended december gross written premium    net written premium net of reinsurance ceded    earned premium before reinsurance ceded    earned premium net of reinsurance ceded    losses and loss adjustment expenses    unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses    crusader s primary line of business is commercial multiple peril business package policies 
this line of business represented approximately of crusader s total written premium for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  as of december   crusader was licensed as an admitted insurance company in the states of arizona  california  idaho  montana  nevada  ohio  oregon  and washington and is approved as a non admitted surplus lines writer in other states 
crusader s gross written premium by state is as follows year ended december california    non california   total gross written premium    for the year ended december   gross written premium increased by  over and gross written premium for the year ended december   increased by  over the growth in written premium is primarily a result of higher premium rates charged by the company  which has resulted in a and increase in the average premium per policy for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in average gross written premium per policy is a result of several factors including a subsidence in price based competition in the property casualty insurance market and an increase in rates for some of the company s products 
the company s future writings growth is dependent on market conditions  competition  and the company s ability to introduce new and profitable products 
the company believes that the hard market condition experienced by the company in no longer exists 
nonetheless  the company continues to benefit from the fact that some of its competitors went out of business and others raised rates or adopted more restrictive rules 
the company s average premium per policy issued is as follows year ended direct written policies average december premium issued premium as indicated in the above table  the number of policies issued during the months ended december   decreased by as compared to the prior year 
however  the average premium per policy in increased by as compared to the months ended december  as previously discussed  the increase in average gross written premium per policy is a result of several factors including a subsidence in price based competition in the property casualty insurance market making the company s products more competitive and an increase in rates for some of the company s products 
beginning july   the company had placed moratoriums on all non california business  primarily due to the fact that much of the company s business outside of california has not been profitable 
the company has no short term plan to expand into additional states or to expand its marketing channels 
instead  the company intends to allocate its resources toward improving its california business rates  rules  and forms 
the company continues to believe that it can compete effectively and profitably by offering better service and by marketing its policies through its current independent agents and brokers 
the company writes annual policies and  therefore  earns written premium daily over the one year policy term 
premium earned before reinsurance increased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and increased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in earned premium before reinsurance in and is a direct result of the increase in written premium for these years 
earned ceded premiums for the months ended december   increased  to  compared to  for the months ended december  earned ceded premiums as a percentage of direct earned premiums were and for and  respectively 
although direct earned premiums in increased as compared to  earned ceded premiums increased only primarily as a result of a rate decrease by the company s reinsurers effective january  earned ceded premiums for the months ended december   increased  to  compared to  for the months ended december  earned ceded premiums as a percentage of direct earned premiums were and for and  respectively 
the rate increase was primarily due to the company s ceded loss experience and the hardening of the reinsurance marketplace 
ceding commissions on the company s excess of loss treaties increased from in to beginning january  ceding commission is a component of policy acquisition costs 
the annual aggregate deductible on crusader s primary excess of loss treaty was  in  and  in and in crusader retained a participation in its excess of loss reinsurance treaties of in its st and nd layers ie  of  in excess of  and of  in excess of  respectively  and in its property clash treaty

premium ceded under the provisionally rated contract  which was canceled on a runoff basis effective december   is subject to adjustment based on the amount of losses ceded  limited by a maximum percentage that can be charged by the reinsurer 
crusader s and st layer primary excess of loss treaty provides for a contingent commission equal to of the net profit  if any  accruing to the reinsurer 
the first accounting period for the contingent commission is december  based on losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded including incurred but not reported losses as of december   no contingent commission has been accrued 
beginning january   crusader increased its retention from  to  per risk 
there has been no change in the annual aggregate deductible amount or participation rates compared to the contingent commission does not apply to premium 
due to favorable loss experience in and  reinsurance premium on the company s st layer primary excess of loss treaty  in excess of  decreased by compared to crusader s direct earned premium  earned ceded premium  and ceding commission are as follows year ended december direct earned premium    earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium    provisionally rated ceded premium    total earned ceded premium    ceding commission    earned ceded premium  net of ceding commission    ratios to direct earned premium direct ceded premium earned ceded premium  net of ceding commission the combined ratio is the sum of the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred including a provision for incurred but not reported losses ibnr to net premiums earned loss ratio and the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned expense ratio 
the following table shows the loss ratios  expense ratios  and combined ratios of crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with gaap 
year ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio as indicated in the above table  loss ratio for the year ended december   decreased to from in and in the decrease in the loss ratio since was primarily due to improvements in the provision for prior years incurred losses 
generally  if the combined ratio is below  an insurance company has an underwriting profit  if it is above  a company has an underwriting loss 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance was  at december   compared to  and  at december  and respectively 
the increase in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in and is primarily a result of increased ibnr reserves as a result of the and increase in direct earned premium in the years ended december  and respectively  as discussed above 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance for each of crusader s lines of business were as follows year ended december line of business cmp    other liability    other    total    the company s consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for unpaid losses and related claim settlement or loss adjustment expenses of the insurance company operation 
crusader sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date as management s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and related expenses incurred as of that date for both reported and unreported losses 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses were  or of net premium earned for the year ended december   compared to  or of net premium earned for the year ended december  incurred losses of prior years were approximately  favorable development for the year ended december   compared to an incurred losses of prior years of  adverse development for the year ended december  losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses were  of net premium earned for the year ended december   compared to  of net premium earned for the year ended december  the decrease in losses for the year ended december   is primarily the result of a decrease in the adverse development of prior year losses in compared to the adverse loss development in was  compared to  in the adverse development in was primarily attributable to one claim 
that claim was a loss in excess of policy limits  arising from a policy issued in the claim was resolved on august   for million through binding arbitration 
available reinsurance limits in were  plus pro rata loss adjustment expenses 
as a result of the binding arbitration decision  in crusader incurred adverse development on this claim  net of reinsurance  of approximately  or approximately  net of taxes 
to help assure that such situations do not reoccur  the company adopted changes in its underwriting and claims adjusting practices  and it bought substantially more reinsurance 
the remaining adverse development in was attributable to continued losses due to the impact of changes in california case law that expanded coverage and increased loss exposure primarily on construction defect claims for claims occurring on or prior to the company s revision of its policy forms in analysis of the roll forward of losses and loss adjustment expenses the following table provides an analysis of the roll forward of crusader s losses and loss adjustment expenses  including a reconciliation of the ending balance sheet liability for the periods indicated year ended december reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at beginning of year net of reinsurance    incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses provision for insured events of current year    increase decrease in provision for events of prior years    total losses and loss adjustment expenses    payments losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of the current year    losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years    total payments    reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year net of reinsurance    reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year    reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year per balance sheet  gross of reinsurance    in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no

managements analysis and actions regarding underwriting activity crusader incurred underwriting losses in   and as a result of these underwriting losses  crusader s management analyzed and acted upon the following components of its underwriting activity business outside of california habitability exposure construction defect exposure special risk class of business increased cost of settling claims  indemnity and expense increased cost of reinsurance mold exposure terrorism exposure the following is a discussion of the above items 
the company believes that except for one aberrational claim previously discussed under the adverse development  the implementation of the above items have contributed to improved operating results in and business outside of california collectively  the insurance underwritten by the company outside of california has been very unprofitable  particularly with respect to the liquor and premises types of liability coverage 
the company adopted substantial rate increases and coverage restrictions beginning in june of for all liquor liability written outside of california and nevada 
the rate increases caused a dramatic decline in sales  causing the company to be concerned about adverse selection 
the company determined that under current market conditions  it could not sell its policies at an adequate rate outside of california and ceased writing in those states 
non california non california accident direct written direct earned year premium premium habitability exposure in and  the company began experiencing adverse development on its apartment house business  due primarily to the effect of settlements on habitability claims 
those settlements were substantially influenced by a statute that provides for the payment of plaintiff attorney fees without regard to policy limits  and by the montrose chemical corp 
v 
admiral insurance company decision of starting in october  the company significantly changed its underwriting practice with respect to the type of apartment buildings thought to cause these claims 
these changes included a 
in september  the company identified a subcategory of apartment building risk  referred to as the big and old group 
the company believes that members of this group pose a greater than average probability of habitability loss 
b 
on september   the company imposed more stringent underwriting restrictions and requirements upon members of the big and old group  including the adoption of more restrictive coverage forms and use of maintenance warranties for members of this group 
c 
on september   the company changed its coverage forms to limit the costs taxed against the insured clause of the supplementary provisions coverage grant  from unlimited to d 
in september  the company adopted an liability rate increase for all of its apartment risks 
since  no additional claims of any significance have been reported to crusader 
the company believes that the combination of improved underwriting and policy language limiting supplemental payments have substantially reduced the exposure 
construction defect exposure the company continuously modifies its underwriting practice with respect to subcontractors in an effort to improve loss experience 
for example  subcontractors performing waterproofing  weather coating  or decking were deemed ineligible by the company in  and  to minimize the adverse effects of the montrose decision of  the company changed its coverage forms in  and  the company adopted numerous  program specific questions to its applications  inspections  and survey forms 
although the company believes that the ultimate results of its post underwriting of this class of business will prove to be profitable  the results will not be known until the year statute runs 
therefore  on april   the company sought regulatory approval for a change in or discontinuation of its experience rating plan 
when the regulator disapproved that filing  on june   the company imposed a moratorium on all new offers of artisan contractors insurance 
in january crusader received regulatory approval of its plan to discontinue experience rating  which translates into a rate increase for all coverages offered to artisan contractors 
however  because the company is cautious about underwriting this type of business  it has not lifted the underwriting moratorium that started on june  since that date  attrition was significant  reducing the number of policies in force 
until such time that the company can change this program to make underwriting more predictable  the moratorium will not be lifted 
the special risks division the company s special risk class of business represents risks written within current underwriting programs that have a higher degree of exposure and require special pricing and underwriting 
in november after a change of program management  the company reviewed those policies underwritten by its special risks division 
that review resulted in the cancellation of a significant number of policies  those thought to be generating most of the losses 
special risk special risk special risk direct written direct earned policies year premium premium in force   as of   as of   as of   as of   as of   as of   as of increased cost of settling claims in the company noticed a trend of increasing costs in settling claims but does not believe that the trend reflects operational changes 
the company believes that the trend is most likely attributable to several changes in the law  including an increased propensity for trial courts to award large plaintiff verdicts 
however  several favorable decisions were recently published  including the us supreme court s limitation on punitive damages see campbell vs 
state farm   and the california supreme court s limitation on public policy reformations see rosen vs 
state farm  
it is difficult to quantify and predict the continuation of this trend 
in  an outside actuary was engaged to assist the company in reviewing the premium rate adequacy of certain key crusader programs and to assist in the regulatory rate filings 
crusader raises its premium rates whenever the adequacy is in doubt 
increased cost of reinsurance in  the cost of reinsurance significantly increased primarily as a result of losses sustained outside of california that the company no longer underwrites 
the company received a slight decrease in its reinsurance rates in mold exposure the company has not seen any significant mold based claims and all of its policies are now being endorsed with a mold exclusion 
in addition  numerous articles from respected medical authorities were recently published  making plaintiffs task of proving mold based injuries much more difficult 
terrorism exposure all policies are endorsed with a terrorism endorsement that conforms with the federal terrorism risk insurance act of november  all policyholders that reject the federal coverage will get a policy containing a terrorism exclusion endorsement 
primarily as a result of the underwriting losses in and  am best company lowered crusader s rating from a excellent to a excellent effective march   based on financial information as of december  at the time the rating was lowered  am best remained concerned with the potential for further adverse loss reserve development and the negative impact it would have on the company s operating performance and overall capitalization and viewed the rating outlook as negative 
due to the continued adverse development in the six months ended june   on october   am best company lowered crusader s rating to b very good and continued to view its rating outlook as negative 
the lowering of crusader s rating to b did not have a material adverse effect on the company 
other insurance operations health and life insurance program commission income from the health and life insurance sales of nib and aib is as follows year ended december commission income    aib markets health and life insurance in california through non affiliated insurance companies for individuals and groups and receives commission and fee income based on the premiums that it writes 
commission and fee income decreased  in the year ended december   compared to the decrease is primarily due to the discontinuance of cigna s individual and family health insurance program in the state of california 
aib was able to secure other insurance for approximately half of the  cigna members that were terminated by cigna 
aib could not obtain insurance for the remaining cigna individuals and family members primarily due to their pre existing health conditions or that they were able to secure insurance through their employer or their spouse s employer 
the discontinuance of cigna s individual and family health insurance program did not affect the cigna small group program 
due to intense competition in both rates and benefits offered  cigna small group program membership decreased in as of december   cigna small group program membership is comprised of  subscribers and dependents compared to  subscribers and  dependents as of december  commissions overrides from other carriers are generally higher than the commission structure paid by cigna 
as such  aib s commission income from all insurance carriers except cigna increased approximately in as compared to commission and fee income for the year ended december  increased  compared to the year ended december  the increase in health and life insurance program commission and fee income was primarily due to an increase in premium written 
this increase was primarily due to the fact that in november cigna terminated their contract with another administrator and approximately  affected members were transitioned into the company s health and life insurance program effective january  approximately were enrolled in the cigna individual health and family program and were enrolled in cigna s small group program 
policy fee income unifax sells and services insurance policies for crusader 
the policy fee charged to the policyholder by unifax is recognized as income in the consolidated financial statements 
policy fee income of unifax is as follows year ended december policy fee income    policies written    policy fee income for the year ended december   decreased  as compared to the year ended december  the slight decrease in policy fee income is a result of a decrease in the number of policies issued during as compared to policy fee income for the year ended december   increased  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in policy fee income was due to an increase in the fee from to per policy written in california effective on and after the latter part of august and due to the  increase in the number of policies written by unifax during as compared to daily automobile rental insurance program the daily automobile rental insurance program is produced by bedford 
bedford receives a commission from a non affiliated insurance company based on premium written 
prior to december   bedford also received a claim administration fee from the non affiliated insurance company

to avoid underwriting losses for the non affiliated insurance company that it represents  bedford continues to produce business only at rates that it believes to be adequate 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
the decrease in claim administration fee income is due to the fact that the company s subsidiary us risk managers  inc  us risk ceased providing insurance claim administration services to a non affiliated property and casualty insurance as of december   and it is currently inactive 
as of december   the non affiliated insurance company assumed the claim administration responsibility for all outstanding and ibnr claims

during  the company did not receive any claim administration fees and will not incur any future internal claim administration costs 
the unearned claim administration reserve as of december   is in the amount of  and it reflects the estimated costs to complete the claim administration by the non affiliated insurer

the termination of policyholders continued through october  due to the discontinuance of cigna s individual and family health insurance program  membership and fee income decreased as these terminated members were no longer members of the association 
the increase in membership and fee income for the year ended december   as compared to is primarily a result of the fact that in november cigna terminated its contract with another administrator and approximately  affected members were transitioned into the company s health and life insurance program effective january  other commission and fee income other commission and fee income are as follows year ended december earthquake program commission income    miscellaneous commission and fee income   total other commission and fee income    unifax began producing commercial earthquake insurance policies in california for non affiliated insurance companies in unifax receives a commission from these insurance companies based on premium written 
commission income on the earthquake program for the year ended december   increased  compared to the prior year

the commissions paid by crusader to unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected in commission income or commission expense 
premium finance program premium finance charges and late fees earned from financing policies are as follows year ended december premium finance charges and fees earned    new loans    aac provides premium financing to crusader policies produced by unifax in california 
the growth of this program is dependent and directly related to the growth of crusader s written premium and aac s ability to market its competitive rates and service to finance those policies 
premium finance charges and fees earned decreased  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year due to the fact that there were  fewer loans financed in the current year 
however  the decrease in the number of new loans issued during was offset by the increase in the average premium financed as compared to during  of all unifax policies were financed and of those policies were financed by aac 
during  of all unifax policies were financed and of those policies were financed by aac 
premium finance charges and fees earned for the year ended december   increased  as compared to the increase in revenues despite the decrease in the number of new loans in was primarily due to a increase in the average policy premium financed as compared to investment income and net realized gains investment income and net realized gains are as follows year ended december interest income insurance company operations    other operations    total interest income    net realized investment gains  total investment income and realized gains    in the year ended december   while the company s average invested assets at amortized value increased  compared to the year ended december   investment income earned excluding net realized gains decreased  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in investment income is primarily the result of a decline in the average return on new and reinvested assets in the company s investment portfolio 
also contributing to the decline in average return is a shorter weighted average maturity of new and reinvested assets 
due to the current interest rate environment  management believes it prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with shorter maturities and therefore  the weighted average maturity of the company s fixed maturity investments has decreased from years as of december   to years as of december  in the year ended december   the company s average yield on invested assets at amortized value was compared to at the year ended december  the company s average invested assets increased in the year ending december   primarily as a result of increased cash flows from operations 
the mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in the portfolio affects the investment income return percentage

all securities held by the company are rated 
when a decline in value of fixed maturities or equity securities is considered other than temporary  a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  there were no other than temporary declines in the value of fixed maturity or equity securities recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
no securities were sold at a loss during  or the following table summarizes  for all fixed maturities in an unrealized loss position as of december   the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time those fixed maturities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position amortized gross cost fair value unrealized loss months    months    over months    total    at december   the company held securities with unrealized appreciation of  and securities with unrealized depreciation of  fixed maturity investments with a gross unrealized loss for a continuous period of to months consisted of us treasury securities 
fixed maturity investments with a gross unrealized loss position for a continuous period of to months consists of us treasury and us government sponsored enterprise securities 
fixed maturity investments with a gross unrealized loss position exceeding a month period consist of us government sponsored enterprise securities and pre refunded state and municipal bonds 
the company monitors its investments closely 
if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary it is written off as a realized loss through the consolidated statements of operations 
the company s methodology of assessing other than temporary impairments is based on security specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer  whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and the company s intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow the company to recover its costs 
the company has concluded that the gross unrealized losses of  at december   were temporary in nature 
however  facts and circumstances may change which could result in a decline in market value considered to be other than temporary 
the company did not sell any fixed maturity investment in the years ended december  and operating expenses policy acquisition costs consist of commissions  premium taxes  inspection fees  and certain other underwriting costs that are directly related to and vary with the production of crusader insurance policies 
these costs include both crusader expenses and allocated expenses of other unico subsidiaries 
on certain reinsurance treaties  crusader receives a ceding commission from its reinsurer that represents a reimbursement of the acquisition costs related to the premium ceded 
no ceding commission is received on facultative  catastrophe  or provisionally rated ceded premium 
policy acquisition costs  net of ceding commission  are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned 
the ratio of policy acquisition cost to net earned premium in and were lower than the ratio in primarily due to the increase in the company s ceding commission from its reinsurer as of january  from in to in both and policy acquisition costs  net of ceding commission  are as follows year ended december policy acquisition costs    ratio to net earned premium gaap ratio salries and employee benefits incurred for the year ended december   increased  compared to the year ended december  total salaries and employee benefits incurred for the year ended december   increased  compared to the year ended december  factors that affected the increase include the hiring of higher level employees  general salary increases less than  and increases in employee benefits costs 
year ended december total salaries and employee benefits incurred    less charged to losses and loss adjustment expenses    less capitalized to policy acquisition costs    net amount charged to operating expenses    commissions to agents brokers not including commissions on crusader policies that are reflected in policy acquisition costs are generally related to gross commission income from the health and life insurance program  the daily automobile rental insurance program  the earthquake program  and the commercial liability program 
commissions to agents and brokers decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in premiums written and the related decrease in the commission expense in the health and life insurance program 
year ended december commission to agents brokers    other operating expenses generally do not change significantly with changes in production 
this is true for both increases and decreases in production 
operating expenses decreased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in other operating expenses was in part due to  decrease in interest expense 
as described below  due a change in law in september  the company recognized as income of the interest expense accrued at december   on a notice of proposed assessment npa by the california franchise tax board for tax years and year ended december other operating expenses    income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december   was  compared to an income tax expense of  for the year ended december  the effective combined income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the pre tax income increased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   which resulted in an increased income tax expense in the income tax expense for the year ended december   was  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  the effective combined income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
in the year ended december   the company recognized an income tax expense of  resulting from an assessment for the years and from the california franchise tax board 
the assessment resulted from a court ruling in ceridian vs 
franchise tax board that held that the california statute permitting the tax deductibility of dividends received from a wholly owned insurance subsidiary was unconstitutional because it discriminated against out of state holding companies and thus was in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the united states constitution 
the ruling concluded that the discriminatory sections of the statute are not severable and the entire statute was invalid and unenforceable 
california law provides that the proper remedy in such circumstances is to disallow the deduction to those taxpayers that benefited from the deduction 
as a result of the court ruling  in february  the franchise tax board ftb notified the company that it would issue a notice of proposed assessment npa for tax years and of approximately  representing california state franchise taxes plus related interest of approximately  in september  california enacted legislation ab that addresses many aspects of the tax treatment of insurance company owners  including holding companies such as unico 
the legislation provides for an election  applicable if made to all tax years ending after december   and before january   under which a dividend received deduction of up to of dividends paid by an insurer to a non insurer parent is allowed 
the company made the election authorized by ab and  therefore  has reversed of the  income tax expense and of the interest accrued thereon 
in addition  as a result of ab  the company recognized a state deferred tax liability of  in accordance with fasb this deferred tax liability represents the company s future state tax liability for all undistributed earnings of crusader since january  the federal tax benefit resulting from ab as of december   is  thus  the net deferred tax liability as of december   is  recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no

i r is effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  there were no other accounting standards issued during that are expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while every effort is made to ensure the integrity of such estimates  actual results could differ 
management believes the company s current critical accounting policies comprise the following losses and loss adjustment expenses the preparation of the company s financial statements requires judgments and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company is required to classify its investments in debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
the company s fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are stated at market value 
although all of the company s investments are classified as available for sale and the company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions  its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
short term investments are carried at cost  which approximates market value 
investments in equity securities are carried at market value 
the unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities and equity securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
when a decline in value of a fixed maturity or equity security is considered other than temporary  a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations based on the specific identification method

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of invested assets whose fair values are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company s invested assets at december  and consisted of the following fixed maturity bonds at amortized cost   short term cash investments at cost   certificates of deposit over year at cost   total invested assets   the company s interest rate risk is primarily in its fixed maturity bond portfolio 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
in addition  the longer the maturity  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company limits this risk by investing in securities with maturities no greater than eight years 
in addition  although fixed maturity bonds are classified as available for sale  the company s investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality bonds to maturity 
because fixed maturity bonds are primarily held to maturity  the change in the market value of these bonds resulting from interest rate movements is unrealized and no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as separate components of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
as of december   the company s unrealized gains net of unrealized losses before income taxes on its fixed maturity bond portfolio were  compared to  as of december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the fixed maturity bond portfolio as of december   would decrease by approximately  this decrease would not be reflected in the statements of operations except to the extent that the securities were sold 
the company s short term investments and certificates of deposit have only minimal interest rate risk
