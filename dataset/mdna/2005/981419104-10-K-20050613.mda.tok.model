item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s financial performance continues to be dependent in large part upon the growth in its outstanding loans receivable  the ongoing introduction of new products and services for marketing to its customer base  the maintenance of loan quality and acceptable levels of operating expenses 
since march   gross loans receivable have increased at a annual compounded rate from million to million at march  the increase reflects both the higher volume of loans generated through the company s existing offices and the contribution of loans generated from new offices opened or acquired over the period 
during this same five year period  the company has grown from offices to offices as of march  the company plans to open or acquire at least new offices in each of the next two fiscal years 
the company continues to identify new products and services for marketing to its customer base 
in addition to new insurance related products  which have been introduced in selected states over the last several years  the company sells and finances electronic items and appliances to its existing customer base 
this program is called the world class buying club 
total loan volume under this program amounted to million during fiscal  a increase from the prior fiscal year 
while this represents less than of the company s total loan volume  it remains a very profitable program  which the company plans to continue to emphasize in fiscal and beyond 
the company s paradata financial systems subsidiary provides data processing systems to separate finance companies  including the company  and currently supports approximately  individual branch offices in states 
paradata s revenue is highly dependent upon its ability to attract new customers  which often requires substantial lead time  and as a result its revenue may fluctuate greatly from year to year 
during fiscal  its net revenues from system sales and support amounted to million  approximately the same as in fiscal paradata s pretax income contribution to the company also can fluctuate greatly and was   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
paradata s net revenue and resulting net contribution to the company will continue to fluctuate on a year to year basis  but management believes this business should remain profitable over the long term 
additionally  and more importantly  paradata continues to provide state of the art data processing support for the company s in house integrated computer system at little or no net cost to the company 
since fiscal  the company has expanded its product line to include larger balance  lower risk  and lower yielding individual consumer loans 
these loans typically average  to  with terms of to months  compared to smaller loans  which average to  with terms of to months 
the company offers the larger loans in all states except texas and colorado  where they are not profitable under our lending criteria and strategy 
additionally  the company has purchased numerous larger loan offices and has made several bulk purchases of larger loans receivable 
as of march   the larger loan category accounted for approximately million of gross loans receivable  a increase over the balance outstanding at march  at the end of the current fiscal year  this portfolio was of the total loan balances  a slight increase from the end of the previous year 
management believes that these loans provide lower expense and loss ratios  and thus provide positive contributions 
while the company does not intend to change its primary lending focus from its small loan business  it does intend to continue expanding the larger loan product line as part of its ongoing growth strategy 
in fiscal  the company tested an income tax return preparation and refund anticipation loan program in of its offices 
based on the results of this test  the company expanded this program in fiscal into substantially all of its offices 
since that time  the program has grown dramatically  with the company preparing approximately   and  returns in fiscal   and  respectively 
net revenue generated by the company from this program during fiscal amounted to approximately million 
the company believes that this profitable business provides a beneficial service to its existing customer base and plans to continue to promote and expand the program in the future

critical accounting policies the company s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the finance company industry 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies involve significant judgment by the company s management  including the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
as a result  changes in these estimates and assumptions could significantly affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company considers its policies regarding the allowance for loan losses to be its most critical accounting policy due to the significant degree of management judgment 
the company has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that take into consideration various assumptions and estimates with respect to the loan portfolio 
the company s assumptions and estimates may be affected in the future by changes in economic conditions  among other factors 
for additional discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses  see credit quality below 

table of contents credit quality the company s delinquency and net charge off ratios reflect  among other factors  changes in the mix of loans in the portfolio  the quality of receivables  the success of collection efforts  bankruptcy trends and general economic conditions 
delinquency is computed on the basis of the date of the last full contractual payment on a loan known as the recency method and on the basis of the amount past due in accordance with original payment terms of a loan known as the contractual method 
management closely monitors portfolio delinquency using both methods to measure the quality of the company s loan portfolio and the probability of credit losses 
the following table classifies the gross loans receivable of the company that were delinquent on a recency and contractual basis for at least days at march    and at march  dollars in thousands recency basis days past due days or more past due total percentage of period end gross loans receivable contractual basis days past due days or more past due total percentage of period end gross loans receivable loans are charged off at the earlier of when such loans are deemed to be uncollectible or when six months have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment 
the company s charge off policy has been consistently applied  and no significant changes have been made to the policy during the periods reported 
management considers the charge off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
at the end of fiscal  the company experienced an increase in contractual delinquency to from at march  the delinquency rate on a recency basis also increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of the current fiscal year 
charge offs as a percent of average loans decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  approximately of the company s loans were generated through renewals of outstanding loans and the origination of new loans to previous customers 
a renewal represents a new loan transaction with a present customer in which a portion of the new loan proceeds is used to repay the balance of an existing loan and the remaining portion is advanced to the customer 
for fiscal   and  the percentages of the company s loan originations that were renewals of existing loans were   and  respectively 
the company s renewal policies are determined based on state regulations and customer payment history 
a renewal is considered a current renewal if the customer is no more than days delinquent on a contractual basis 
delinquent renewals may be extended to customers that are more than days past due on a contractual basis if the customer completes a new application and the manager believes that the customer s ability and intent to repay has improved 
it is the company s policy to not renew delinquent loans in amounts greater than the original amounts financed 
in all cases  a customer must complete a new application every two years 
during fiscal  delinquent renewals represented of the company s total loan volume 

table of contents charge offs  as a percentage of loans made by category  are greatest on loans made to new borrowers and less on loans made to former borrowers and renewals 
this is as expected due to the payment history experience available on repeat borrowers 
however  as a percentage of total loans charged off  renewals represent the greatest percentage due to the volume of loans made in this category 
the following table depicts the charge offs as a percent of loans made by category and as a percent of total charge offs during fiscal loan volume by category percent of total charge offs percent of loans made renewals former borrowers new borrowers the company maintains an allowance for loan losses in an amount that  in management s opinion  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the company charges against current earnings  as a provision for loan losses  amounts added to the allowance to maintain it at levels expected to cover probable losses of principal 
when establishing the allowance for loan losses  the company takes into consideration the growth of the loan portfolio  the mix of the loan portfolio  current levels of charge offs  current levels of delinquencies  and current economic factors 
in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 the company accrues an estimated loss if it is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
it is probable that there are losses in the existing portfolio 
to estimate the losses  the company uses historical information for net charge offs and average loan life by loan type 
this methodology is based on the fact that many customers renew their loans prior to the contractual maturity 
average contractual loan terms are approximately nine months and the average life is approximately four months 
based on this methodology  the company had an allowance for loan losses that approximated six months of average net charge offs at march    and therefore  at each year end the company had an allowance for loan losses that covered estimated losses for its existing loans based on historical charge offs and average lives 
in addition  the entire loan portfolio turns over approximately times during a typical twelve month period 
therefore  a large percentage of loans that are charged off during any fiscal year are not on the company s books at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the company believes that it is not appropriate to provide for losses on loans that have not been originated  that twelve months of net charge offs is not needed in the allowance  and that the methodology employed is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
for the years ended march   and  the company recorded adjustments of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  to the allowance for loan losses in connection with acquisitions in accordance generally accepted accounting principles 
these adjustments represent the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans 
the company records acquired loans at fair value based on current interest rates  less allowances for uncollectibility and collection costs 
the acquired loan portfolios generally include some loans that the company deems uncollectible but which do not have an allowance assigned to them by the acquiree 
an allowance for loan losses is then estimated based on a review of the loan portfolio  considering delinquency levels  charge offs  loan mix and other current economic factors 
the company then records the acquired loans at their gross value and records the related allowance for loan losses 
these are reflected as purchase accounting acquisitions in the table below 
subsequent charge offs related to acquired loans are reflected in the purchase accounting acquisition adjustment in the year of acquisition

the company believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses in the existing portfolio at march

quarterly information and seasonality the company s loan volume and corresponding loans receivable follow seasonal trends 
the company s highest loan demand typically occurs from october through december  its third fiscal quarter 
loan demand has generally been the lowest and loan repayment highest from january to march  its fourth fiscal quarter 
loan volume and average balances typically remain relatively level during the remainder of the year 
this seasonal trend affects quarterly operating performance through corresponding fluctuations in interest and fee income and insurance commissions earned and the provision for loan losses recorded  as well as fluctuations in the company s cash needs 
consequently  operating results for the company s third fiscal quarter generally are significantly lower than in other quarters and operating results for its fourth fiscal quarter significantly higher than in other quarters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments consist of the following cash  loans receivable  senior notes payable  and other note payable 
fair value approximates carrying value for all of these instruments 
loans receivable are originated at prevailing market rates and have an average life of approximately four months 
given the short term nature of these loans  they are continually repriced at current market rates 
the company s revolving credit facility has a variable rate based on a margin over libor and reprices with any changes in libor 
the company s outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility and its other note payable was million at march  interest on borrowings under this facility is based  at the company s option  on the prime rate or libor plus 
based on the outstanding balance at march   a change of in the interest rates would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
while increases in operating costs would adversely affect the company s operations  the consumer lending laws of three of the twelve states in which the company operates allow indexing of maximum loan amounts to the consumer price index 
these provisions will allow the company to make larger loans at existing interest rates in those states  which could partially offset the potential increase in operating costs due to inflation
