item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion regarding surewest telephone s revenues that are subject to the competitive environment in which surewest telephone operates 
the company anticipates that its businesses will continue to experience competition and that the nature and extent of such competition will increase 
competitors to the surewest telephone business include competitive local exchange carriers  interexchange carriers including interexchange carriers which serve customers directly without using facilities of local exchange carriers  wireless service providers  providers of ip based calling services  customers which are telecommunications self providers  and a range of other providers that specialize in 
table of contents certain niche areas of telecommunications 
technology change has accelerated the pressure on established carriers  including surewest telephone  by virtue of software defined businesses  and innovations related to packet switching and use of the internet and ip capabilities 
regulation surewest telephone s revenues are influenced greatly by the actions of the cpuc and the fcc 
all intrastate telecommunications service rates of surewest telephone are subject to comprehensive regulation by the cpuc 
the provision of access to the networks of interexchange carriers for long distance calling is governed by access tariffs and by intercarrier agreements  which are subject to the jurisdiction of the cpuc or fcc  or both  depending upon the nature of the transmissions 
surewest telephone has a tariff on file with the fcc for all elements of interstate access services except carrier common line charges  for which surewest telephone concurs with the tariff of the national exchange carrier association neca 
in february  congress passed the telecommunications act of the act  which was intended to expand the opportunities for competition in a range of telecommunications businesses  and which has significantly changed the regulatory environment 
see item legal proceedings and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion regarding the impact of the act 
the application of the act in particular circumstances continues to present contentious issues for carriers and others  and a number of court appeals were pending as of december  that would affect the application of the act to the company 
the fcc monitors surewest telephone s interstate earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies that are prepared and submitted by surewest telephone in accordance with rules governing the preparation of such studies 
surewest telephone utilizes actual and estimated cost information and actual and projected demand usage to prepare these studies 
the characterization of traffic as interstate or intrastate  and as a telecommunications or information service has been a significant source of dispute among carriers and others in recent years  as such characterizations can impact the regulatory treatment of such traffic and the payment obligations of the providers who are involved 
the characterization of i traffic involved in intercarrier interconnection  ii internet traffic  and iii traffic that makes use of ip and other transmission technologies are examples of issues that are currently subject to analysis on the state and federal levels  and that are expected to be subject to regulatory action in the near future 
both the fcc and cpuc have initiated proceedings to evaluate the appropriate level of regulation for providers of telecommunications services and for ip enabled services 
in addition  various proceedings at the fcc are pending that could lead to significant alteration of the existing compensation arrangements among providers of telecommunications services  and that could impact the amount of the payments received by the company from carriers and others for use of the company s network 
with respect to regulation administered by the cpuc  in  the cpuc issued a decision in connection with surewest telephone s general rate proceeding  which authorized surewest telephone to implement a new regulatory framework nrf for services furnished within surewest telephone s service area in order to accommodate increased competition and to afford greater pricing flexibility 
under the nrf  surewest telephone is subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements  and it was initially required to share earnings with customers through a reduction of revenues if its earned annual intrastate rate of return exceeds that authorized by the cpuc 
in accordance with the requirements of its general rate case order  surewest telephone filed an application for review of its nrf in and requested that the sharing mechanism be suspended  consistent with past cpuc decisions for other incumbent local exchange carriers in california 
after a verification audit by the cpuc s office of ratepayer advocates ora  the cpuc issued a decision in june that failed to suspend the sharing mechanism  and required certain new changes in the method used to allocate costs for services provided by surewest telephone to its affiliates  the treatment of certain directory revenues and the treatment of internal use software costs 
since that time  surewest telephone has been engaged in proceedings to modify that 
table of contents decision and to implement a nrf that is consistent with that applicable to other ilecs within the state 
during  the company was involved in a proceeding at the cpuc that considered the continued need for the sharing requirements in the intrastate jurisdiction 
on july   the company entered into a settlement agreement with the other parties in the proceeding  the ora and the utility reform network turn  to resolve all issues in the proceeding 
on november   the cpuc approved this settlement agreement resolving existing sharing obligations and related earnings issues for the monitoring periods  and putting into place a surcredit mechanism for the amount of the settlement  and suspending the requirement for any intrastate sharing for monitoring periods from january  through at least december  the settlement agreement resulted in surewest telephone recognizing an increase in local revenues of million due to a change in accounting estimate 
this increase in revenues resulted in a decrease of the company s net loss by million per share during in accordance with the november  settlement agreement  surewest telephone will return approximately million  plus interest at an annual contractual rate of and imputed rate of  to its customers in the form of a surcredit over a period of four years beginning january  and will pay a one time customer refund of million  which includes an annual imputed interest rate of no stated contractual interest rate  in the form of a surcredit over two years beginning january  to settle the monitoring periods to at december   the aggregate contractual shareable earnings obligation for these surcredits was million  which is net of an unamortized discount pertaining to imputed interest of thousand at such date 
future payments for these obligations are million in and and million in and further  commencing january   surewest telephone shall implement a permanent annual consumer dividend of million to end users receiving surewest telephone services subject to sharing on or after that date  however  this consumer dividend is subject to reduction based upon the results of other pending regulatory proceedings 
in addition to its regulatory authority with respect to surewest telephone s rates  the cpuc also has the power  among other things  to establish terms and conditions of service  to prescribe uniform systems of accounts and to regulate the mortgaging or disposition of public utility properties 
in november  the cpuc authorized sbc to terminate its approximate annual million extended area service payments to surewest telephone effective november  and authorized replacement funding on an interim basis from the california high cost fund chcf 
the chcf is a program designed by the cpuc to establish a fair and equitable local rate structure and to reduce any disparity in the rates charged by telephone companies serving high cost areas 
the chcf was due to expire on january  however  on september   the governor of california signed sb into law  which amended the existing legislation and extended the expiration date to january  in addition  the cpuc ordered a separate proceeding for the purpose of determining whether future recovery of all  none or a portion of the approximate million should come from surewest telephone s ratepayers or other regulatory recovery mechanisms 
see item legal proceedings  for further discussion of these proceedings 
these actions of the cpuc and of the fcc  as noted above  can affect the rates charged for access and interconnection  and  as a result  the revenues derived by the company from access and related services 
surewest telephone s future operations also may be impacted by other proceedings at the fcc and cpuc  including proceedings that address interstate access and other rates and charges  the nature of interconnection between incumbent local exchange carriers and others  the collection and distribution of support payments required to assure universal access to basic telephone services  and the charges that can be assessed for new forms of service that directly or indirectly utilize carrier networks 
substantially all of the interstate long distance business was detariffed after a transition period that started on may  and ended in  after the fcc issued a detariffing order on january  and all related appeals were exhausted 
the long distance business is recognized as being fully competitive  and there are many providers of long distance services 
the emergence from bankruptcy reorganization proceedings of some larger interexchange and competitive local exchange carriers has created new competitive pressures in the sector for both wholesale and retail providers 
because of the level of competition  regulation of this area of the telecommunications business is light or has been removed altogether 
where it exists  regulation is focused on 
table of contents specific public policy concerns  such as customer account slamming  rather than the rates  terms and conditions of service 
broadband general the broadband segment includes surewest broadband  surewest internet  surewest custom data services and surewest broadband residential services 
the broadband segment also includes a competitive local exchange carrier clec  which was authorized by the cpuc in to provide telecommunications services in areas outside the telephone service area of surewest telephone 
as of january   the company consolidated the operations of surewest internet and surewest custom data services into the operations of surewest broadband for financial reporting purposes  though they remain separate legal entities 
in addition  as of january   the company consolidated the operations of surewest broadband  surewest televideo and surewest televideo of roseville for financial reporting purposes  though they remain separate legal entities 
the broadband segment provides services to residential  business and carrier customers 
the services include high speed and dial up internet service  digital video  local and network access  long distance and managed services 
these services initially were offered in the greater sacramento area  principally to customers residing outside of surewest telephone s service area 
however  over time  internet and similar services have been made available to customers without regard to service area boundaries  and commencing in december  surewest broadband also began providing digital video and high speed internet services to customers within surewest telephone s service area 
certain of the company s affiliates possess cable television licenses or franchises in sacramento county  in placer county and in the cities of roseville and lincoln 
the company is now authorized to provide video programming to all or substantially all of the residents in the surewest telephone service area 
during  surewest broadband purchased from the fcc two gigahertz ghz local multipoint distribution system lmds spectrum licenses  which provide spectrum coverage in parts of eleven different counties in the greater sacramento area 
these spectrum licenses allow surewest broadband to expand its network within these areas by using wireless technology for extra transmission capacity backhaul 
during  surewest broadband also began using these licenses to offer a fixed wireless dsl service to customers outside of surewest telephone s service area in parts of lincoln and rocklin  california 
in  surewest broadband plans to further expand its fixed wireless dsl service by offering this service to customers in other areas in sacramento and placer counties 
in addition  surewest broadband will continue to use this wireless spectrum for backhaul in cost effective areas 
the broadband segment accounted for approximately  and of the company s operating revenues in the years  and  respectively 
as of december   the broadband segment had  customers 
the broadband segment s backbone network is comprised primarily of optical fiber and is subject to continual expansion and diversification in response to business growth 
the broadband segment provides dial up and high speed internet services and custom data solutions  including collocation  fixed and burstable bandwidth  managed services and network monitoring services 
surewest broadband provides dsl based internet services to residential and business customers in the surewest telephone service area as well as high speed internet services to business customers outside of surewest telephone s service area  primarily in the greater sacramento region 
surewest broadband had  dsl customers as of december  surewest broadband residential services commenced operations in july when the company acquired the assets formerly held by western integrated networks  llc 
surewest broadband residential services provides a bundled offering consisting of digital video  high speed internet  and telephone services to residential customers in the greater sacramento area referred to as fiber to the premise fttp previously referred to as triple play 
substantially all of the services provided by surewest broadband residential services utilize digital 
table of contents fiber network capability 
surewest broadband residential services utilizes the surewest broadband brand 
from its original base in july of approximately  subscribers  the surewest broadband residential services subsidiary reached a fiber to the premise subscriber level of  as of december  in  surewest broadband residential services obtained a cable television franchise in roseville  california  and it began offering video programming services to residential customers in december surewest broadband residential services is also authorized to offer video programming services to customers in other parts of the surewest telephone service area  including citrus heights and areas within unincorporated placer county 
surewest broadband residential services procures digital transport capability from its affiliate  surewest telephone  and has developed an advanced method of delivering video services to subscribers using internet protocol  or ip video capability 
the company expects that each of its segments operating in roseville and other parts of surewest telephone s service area should benefit from the company offerings of telecommunications  cable television and internet services 
surewest broadband residential services acquired a new franchise in lincoln  california in early  and one for portions of placer county in later  and it has expanded its services in to already licensed areas of elk grove and natomas  california as well as other areas within its service area footprint 
competition except as noted below  the businesses in the broadband segment are subject to extensive competition 
competition is highly fragmented  and has grown dramatically in recent years 
except for the digital video delivery business  which requires significant capital investment to serve designated service territories  the barriers to entry are not high  and technology changes force rapid competitive adjustments 
surewest broadband competes regularly against sbc  which is the incumbent local exchange carrier in sacramento and most of its surrounding areas 
the broadband segment also competes against frontier communications in southern sacramento county 
numerous clecs and others offer telecommunications and related services on a flexible and highly specialized basis in the sacramento area 
the company has found that it can be successful by constantly seeking out new sales opportunities in attractive segments of the market  by maintaining a highly reliable network that is accessible to new customers  and by focusing on the provision of excellent service to its customers 
to the extent permitted by law and regulatory requirements  the company seeks to operate its business across the broadband segment in an integrated manner  and its network as a single integrated facility 
the operating units in this segment benefit within the region from the name recognition and reputation of surewest  and from the active participation of company executives and employees in civic and other groups 
during  the company was able to obtain approval from the sacramento metropolitan cable television commission to activate service for customers in green field areas that were previously outside of the company s approved build out and activation schedules 
it now anticipates that it will achieve a competitive market share in the provision of telephone  digital video and internet services in many of these areas around sacramento 
it is important to the company that its operations in this segment be able to deliver services to customers in developing areas as they grow 
the company is also considering whether a modification or expansion of its service territory in sacramento county is appropriate 
the broadband segment has assumed the responsibility for much of the company s dsl and high speed internet retail customer base 
the emergence of cable modems  wireless internet access and other avenues to reach the internet provide significant competition 
the presence of other broadband internet access providers has begun to have an impact on pricing  which has been under downward pressure in the region 
the market faced by the company among multichannel video providers is very competitive 
the main competitors of surewest broadband residential services are comcast and various satellite television providers 
in the company s opinion  the comcast organization possesses significant market power in sacramento county 
however  the governing sacramento county commission promotes competition in the provision of cable service  and has a straightforward franchise and licensing ordinance that accommodates other new entrants rapidly  and allows them flexibility in defining service territories 
surewest has entered the sacramento  roseville and lincoln cable service markets as the second or subsequent franchisee  and while it will  therefore  benefit from the somewhat reduced regulation that such entrants enjoy  it will nevertheless face the challenge of drawing 
table of contents customers away from the incumbent provider 
the provision of cable television over a closed transmission path has been recognized as possessing certain monopoly characteristics and  therefore  the ability of a second or subsequent provider to succeed in the marketplace is not assured 
similarly  the possession of comparative size and scale can give a competitor an advantage in both access to and pricing of the program content needed to operate a cable television business  and comcast possesses significantly greater size and scale in sacramento than the company 
regulation like surewest telephone  surewest broadband must comply with various rules of the cpuc governing tariffs  access to information  consumer protection and similar matters for a telecommunication service provider 
the fcc has jurisdiction over the surewest broadband interstate services  such as access service 
in  the fcc adopted rules that will cause clec interstate switched access charges to decline over time  and that have also caused a decline in the amount of compensation that can be derived from internet service provider dial up traffic 
surewest broadband is only minimally affected by these actions  and has already modified its rates to comply with the fcc requirements 
in late  the fcc began a triennial review of its policies on unbundled network elements unes and other regulations that affect the nature of competition between ilecs and clecs 
the fcc concluded its triennial review in early  and its action was appealed by a number of parties 
the appellate court reversed the fcc and vacated significant portions of the fcc rules in a decision that was released in early march  but stayed its mandate for a short time 
subsequently  the fcc released a new decision with modified rules 
that new decision also has been appealed 
surewest broadband does not rely to any significant degree on unes or other offerings that would be affected by these appeals  and it does not rely generally on the availability of discounted incremental cost pricing of service elements from the incumbent local exchange carrier to serve retail customers 
however  the position of surewest broadband in the sacramento market could be affected by a change in law or regulation that granted unrestricted pricing flexibility to the incumbent local exchange carrier in sacramento or that denies competitors the ability to assure that pricing concessions given to customers are nondiscriminatory and offered on a consistent basis 
the cable television business is governed by federal  state and local laws and regulation  but is most substantially controlled by the mechanisms in title vi of the communications act of  as amended 
while closely regulated in some areas  providers of cable services are generally free from rate regulation  and have wide leeway to select and package the content that they deliver 
in exchange for their use of local streets and rights of way  cable providers are required to pay franchise fees  and to deliver public  educational and governmental channels for use by the community  among other things 
wireless the wireless segment consists of the company s subsidiary surewest wireless  which provides wireless services 
surewest wireless was formed for the purpose of providing wireless personal communications services  or pcs 
pcs is viewed generally as involving the capability to deliver a more advanced set of features and capabilities than the basic form of cellular mobile service 
surewest wireless derives its revenue from the provision of wireless pcs  and the sale of handsets and related communications equipment 
in addition  surewest wireless generates revenue from long distance calls  roaming service  custom calling and other features 
during  surewest wireless purchased from the fcc spectrum licenses that allow it to offer wireless services in four basic trading areas  representing counties located in central california 
these areas include the cities of sacramento  stockton  modesto and yuba city 
each license represents megahertz of spectrum  and accommodates digital wireless technology that is capable of providing both voice and data transmission 
surewest wireless commenced deployment of the network infrastructure in and initiated wireless telecommunications services with telephone  paging and voicemail capabilities in june 
table of contents surewest wireless established its market share in the sacramento market in large part by promoting an unlimited flat rate regional calling plan 
wireless customer acquisition has historically been most active during the december holiday season  and the company has always been active in sales and marketing at this time 
during and  surewest wireless initiated a number of new service options for customers  including additional regional plans  an unlimited national plan  a family plan and new vertical services such as wireless data capabilities  which have attracted new customers 
evolution of the marketplace has prompted surewest wireless to open five retail stores in its service area  with plans to open a sixth store in lincoln  california in late surewest wireless is working to reduce customer churn and to increase the amount of revenue it derives from each customer in as of december   surewest wireless had  subscribers 
the wireless segment accounted for approximately  and of the company s operating revenue in the years  and  respectively 
the wireless business requires capital investment to build new cell sites and to deploy digital and other advanced service capabilities 
in  capital investment in surewest wireless will emphasize continued improvements in service levels and de emphasize network expansion 
competition the market for wireless services is highly competitive 
there are numerous facilities based wireless providers in the sacramento market  including all of the major national providers  and additional wireless resellers 
most of these competitors have a national presence and  therefore  have the ability to leverage national advertising budgets and name recognition 
in addition  many of the competitors have access to additional spectrum in the geographic markets in which surewest wireless competes 
in order for surewest wireless to succeed in this geographic market  it must establish innovative services  such as its unlimited flat rate service package  and continue to leverage the surewest name and reputation 
a trend toward consolidation in this segment has begun to emerge  with the announcement of merger agreements involving some of the largest wireless providers 
however  competition in this segment is expected to remain intense 
regulation because of their use of valuable spectrum resources  wireless services are subject to regulation 
the construction  operation  management and transfer of digital wireless systems in the united states are regulated by the fcc and cpuc 
however  regulators do not interfere with price plans offered to wireless customers 
effective november   the fcc mandated that wireless carriers provide for local number portability lnp 
lnp allows subscribers to keep their wireless phone numbers while switching to a different service provider 
although the company has experienced favorable porting activity  the implementation of lnp has not had a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other significant events sale of alarm monitoring division in january  the company sold substantially all of the assets of its alarm monitoring division  which was a component of the telecom segment  for approximately million 
this sale resulted in a pre tax gain of million during through december   the company had received cash proceeds of million  of which million and thousand were received during and the fourth quarter of  respectively  related to the sale of the alarm monitoring division assets 
the alarm monitoring assets consisted primarily of customer contracts and equipment  which had a net book value of approximately thousand as of the date of the sale 
the purchaser of the assets commenced litigation against the company relating to claims under the asset purchase agreement  generally in connection with certain contracts assigned to the purchaser 
in july  the company and the purchaser settled the litigation and the parties released all claims in exchange for payment by the company to the purchaser of thousand  which was paid during total operating revenues attributable to the company s alarm monitoring division during were thousand none in or 

table of contents acquisition of the assets of western integrated networks  llc on july   the company purchased substantially all of the assets of western integrated networks  llc and certain affiliates collectively  win in a transaction supervised by the united states bankruptcy court for the district of colorado the bankruptcy court 
the assets of win acquired by the company  consisted principally of accounts receivable and property  plant and equipment located in sacramento county  california 
the purchase price for the assets of win consisted of i million in cash  ii direct acquisition costs of thousand  and iii the assumption of certain liabilities aggregating million relating principally to executory contracts and capital lease obligations 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  million of the aggregate purchase price was held in an escrow account to protect the company in the event of any claims available to the company 
in january  thousand was released to the company 
during march  the company resolved the remaining issues related to the escrow  and a settlement agreement was executed that gave the company undisputed rights to certain deposits held by a third party in connection with win s network construction 
as a result  in april  the bankruptcy court signed an order that allowed the remainder of the funds in escrow to be released to the win estate 
in november  the third party refunded thousand to the company to cover all unused deposits through april   which was recorded as a reduction of property  plant and equipment 
factors that could affect future results the company advises of numerous risk factors that should be taken into account in evaluating any investment in surewest securities 
representative examples of these factors include without limitation the following we expect to continue to face significant competition in all parts of our business and the level of competition is expected to intensify 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
we face actual or potential competition from many existing and emerging companies  including other incumbent and competitive local telephone companies  long distance carriers and resellers  wireless telephone companies  internet service providers  satellite companies and cable television companies 
we may not be able to successfully anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including regulatory changes that may affect our competitors and us differently  new technologies and services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends and discount pricing strategies by competitors 
as the incumbent carrier in sacramento  sbc enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  favorable regulatory position  brand recognition and connection to virtually all of our customers and potential customers there 
as the largest cable operator in sacramento and placer county  comcast enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  ownership or superior access to programming and other content  brand recognition  and first in the field advantages with a customer base that generates positive cash flow for its operations 
we face intense competition in our markets for long distance  internet access and other ancillary services that are important to our business and to our growth strategy 
we must adapt to rapid technological change 
technological developments could increase our costs and cause a decline in demand for our services 
in addition  technology changes can reduce the costs of entry for others and give competitors significant new advantages 
if we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment that becomes obsolete  we will be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers  and we may be placed at a cost disadvantage in offering other services 
additionally  replacing or upgrading our infrastructure in the future could result in significant capital expenditures 
we are subject to a complex and uncertain regulatory environment 
some parts of our business are extensively regulated  and the nature of regulation continues to undergo fundamental change and reinterpretation 
many businesses that compete with the company are comparatively less regulated 
many significant regulatory decisions have had to be accommodated in recent years  and there are pending decisions on issues affecting the company that are of great importance 

table of contents our operations have undergone material changes  and our actual operating results can be expected to differ from the results indicated in our historical financial statements 
as a result of our acquisition of assets from win in  and the subsequent expansion of our cable television business  our mix of operating assets differs from those operations upon which our historical financial statements are based 
consequently  our historical financial statements may not be reliable as an indicator of future results 
our success depends upon our ability to manage our growth and expansion 
if our acquisitions and growth initiatives are not successful  we could suffer an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our growth strategy will continue to require us to invest significant capital in facilities and services that may not achieve the desired returns 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to manage our growth  including our ability to build network and related facilities to serve new customers  integrate our operations to take advantage of new capabilities and systems  attract and retain skilled personnel across the company  effectively manage the demands of day to day operations in new areas while attempting to execute our business strategy  and realize the projected growth and revenue targets developed by company management 
we are reliant on support funds provided under federal and state laws 
we receive revenues from various federal or state support funds interstate common line support from the universal service program  california high cost fund b and universal lifeline service fund 
these governmental programs are reviewed and amended from time to time  and are likely to change in the near future 
as described in the regulation section above  the company currently receives funding of million annually from the chcf  a program designed by the cpuc to establish a fair and equitable local rate structure and to reduce any disparity in the rates charged by certain telephone companies serving high cost areas 
the chcf was due to expire on january  on september   the governor of california signed sb into law  which amended the existing legislation and extended the expiration date to january  the outcome and impact on the company s operations resulting from future changes to these governmental programs cannot be determined at this time 
we could be harmed by the recent adverse developments affecting other communications companies 
there have been numerous bankruptcies and other financial difficulties experienced by other carriers and suppliers in the telecommunications and internet sectors 
similar situations with our suppliers  some of whom provide products and services for which there are few substitutes  could cause us to experience delays  service interruptions or additional expenses 
situations with carriers and other customers could affect our ability to collect for services that have been provided 
we often depend on third parties  over whom we have no control  to deliver our services 
because of the interconnected nature of the telecommunications industry  we depend heavily on other local telephone companies  long distance carriers  and numerous other third parties to deliver our services 
in addition  we are dependent on easements  franchises and licenses from various private parties such as established telephone companies and other utilities  railroads  long distance companies  and from state highway authorities  local governments and transit authorities for access to aerial pole space  underground conduits and other rights of way in order to construct and operate our networks 
the failure to maintain in effect the necessary third party arrangements on acceptable terms would have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
we are subject to new corporate governance and internal control reporting requirements  and our failure to comply with existing and future requirements could adversely affect our business 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section and related securities and exchange commission rules  we have furnished a report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls at december  in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm audited and reported on  management s assessment 
management concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective at december  if our deficiencies are not adequately addressed  we could experience accounting errors that could result in misstatements of our financial position and results of operations  potential restatements of our financial statements or otherwise adversely affect our business  reputation and results of operations 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities 

table of contents if we are unable to effectively and efficiently implement the necessary initiatives to eliminate the material weakness identified in our internal controls and procedures  there could be an adverse affect on our operations or financial results 
in connection with the management s report on internal control over financial reporting  management identified a material weakness in the company s internal control over financial reporting relating to the accounting for property  plant and equipment  which resulted from control weaknesses that caused the following conditions the company was unable to completely reconcile its plant in service and plant under construction subsidiary ledgers to the corresponding general ledger balances for periods throughout and as of december  management believes these unreconciled differences are attributable principally to deficiencies in the reliability of the company s information system interfaces between the general ledger and the property  plant and equipment subsidiary ledgers 
in addition  during  several errors occurred in the company s periodic depreciation and capitalized interest calculations that were more than inconsequential 
additionally  as of december   the company did not have effective procedures with which to determine the cost bases of property  plant and equipment that had been retired 
moreover  certain manual internal controls pertaining to property  plant and equipment implemented by the company during the third quarter of were not operating effectively as of december  these matters required the company to record adjustments to both its annual and interim consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounts affected by this material weakness are property  plant and equipment and related accumulated depreciation included in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and depreciation expense and interest expense included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
due to this material weakness  management believes that as of december   the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission criteria 
during the year ended december   we implemented various initiatives  and will be implementing additional initiatives in to improve our internal controls  and address the matters discussed in management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
the implementation of the initiatives and the consideration of additional necessary improvements are among our highest priorities 
the board of directors  under the direction of the audit committee  will continually assess the progress of the initiatives and the improvements  and take further actions as deemed necessary 
until the identified material weakness is eliminated  there is a risk of an adverse affect on our operations or financial results

item legal proceedings 
dollars in thousands except for the proceedings described below  the company is not aware of any material pending legal proceedings  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business  to which it is a party or to which any of its property is subject 
regulatory matters as indicated in item above  surewest telephone is subject to regulation by the federal communications commission fcc and the california public utilities commission cpuc 
in the past  there have been various proceedings before these agencies to which surewest telephone has been a party 
reference is made to item for further information regarding the nature of the jurisdiction of the fcc and cpuc over the business and operations of surewest telephone 
in  the cpuc issued a decision in connection with surewest telephone s general rate proceeding  which authorized surewest telephone to implement a new regulatory framework nrf for services furnished within surewest telephone s service area in order to accommodate market and regulatory movement toward competition and greater pricing flexibility 
under the nrf  surewest telephone is subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements  and it was initially required to share earnings with customers through a reduction of revenues if its earned annual rate of return exceeds that authorized by the cpuc 
in accordance with the requirements of its general rate case order  surewest telephone filed an application for review of its nrf in in connection with this proceeding  the cpuc s office of ratepayer advocates ora undertook a verification audit of surewest telephone s non regulated and affiliated transactions pursuant to the general rate case and other cpuc orders 
in june  the cpuc adopted its decision in this matter the decision

telecom ilec access lines long distance lines broadband dsl subscribers fttp subscribers revenue generating units wireless subscribers dsl subscribers are customers who receive data services within surewest telephone s service area 
fttp subscribers are customers who receive digital video  voice and or data services from broadband residential services 
the broadband segment can deliver multiple services to a customer 
accordingly  the company maintains statistical data regarding revenue generating units for digital video  voice and data  in addition to the number of customers 
for example  a single customer who purchases digital video  voice and data services would be reflected as three revenue generating units 

table of contents operating revenues from external customers in the telecom segment increased  compared to local service revenue increased  primarily due to changes in accounting estimates related to surewest telephone s shareable earnings obligations for a more detailed discussion see regulatory matters within the telecom segment results of operations section below 
in addition  directory advertising revenue increased  resulting primarily from increases in i advertising rates and ii programs and bundled packages purchased by existing customers 
these increases to operating revenues were offset  in part  by decreases in local and network access service due to competition from wireless and wireline competitors and an approximate decline in access lines 
while the telecom segment continues to generate a majority of the company s revenues and yield significant cash flows and net income  the company believes that the results of the telecom segment in recent years support  in part  the company s decision to develop its other business segments 
broadband operating revenues increased  and  in and  respectively  as compared to each prior year period 
during  the broadband segment experienced a increase in the number of dsl subscribers compared to more significantly  this segment had  fttp subscribers and  revenue generating units at december  within the broadband residential services business 
while continuing to produce significant revenue increases  the expansion of the broadband residential services has and will continue to require significant capital and expense commitments 
accordingly  the broadband segment incurred larger year over year operating and net losses in the years and the wireless segment reported increases in operating revenues of  and  in and  respectively  compared to each prior year period 
the number of wireless subscribers increased to  at december   representing a increase for the year surewest wireless established its market share in the sacramento market in large part by promoting an unlimited flat rate regional calling plan 
wireless customer acquisition has historically been most active during the december holiday season  and the company has always been active in sales and marketing at that time 
throughout and  surewest wireless initiated a number of new service options for customers  including additional regional plans  an unlimited national plan  a family plan and new vertical services such as wireless data capabilities  which have attracted new customers 
evolution of the marketplace has prompted surewest wireless to open five retail stores in its service area with plans to open a sixth store in late surewest wireless is also seeking to expand its service penetration among major accounts in  while seeking to reduce customer turnover churn and to increase revenues from its customer base 
the company s consolidated operating expenses increased  in compared to the prior year 
this increase was due in part to an increase in cost of services and products expense exclusive of depreciation and amortization associated with a larger number of subscribers and services within the broadband and wireless segments 
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of i consulting and legal fees due to the treasury investigation  audit services and sarbanes oxley implementation and compliance and ii an increase in stock based compensation 
the company experienced an approximate increase in full time equivalent employees  resulting in increases to salaries and wages  worker s compensation and medical insurance costs 
further  on december   the company initiated a voluntary enhanced early retirement program the reward program 
the reward program was offered to certain eligible employees across all business units 
in addition to retirement benefits  eligible employees will receive enhanced medical benefits for a specified period of time 
as of december   employees had accepted the reward program 
accordingly  the company recorded  in operating expenses related to the reward program during the fourth quarter of additionally  subsequent to december   additional employees accepted the reward program 
as a result  the company will record approximately in additional operating expense during the first quarter of 
table of contents the company s consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased  in this decrease was primarily due to a change in accounting estimate  predominately increasing the estimated useful lives of certain assets 
the asset life extension resulted from the adoption of new technologies that enable the company to maximize the use of existing network facilities and migrate to other new technologies at the point in time in which the benefit to do so exceeds the cost of conversion 
as a result of this change in strategic direction  which was formally approved by the company s board of directors in december  the company has evaluated the appropriateness of its estimated useful lives of certain property  plant and equipment in both the telecom and wireless segments 
based on this evaluation  the company increased the estimated useful lives of telecom s digital switching  circuit and cable equipment by one to three years and wireless base stations  towers and network software by one to eight years 
the company also decreased the estimated useful lives of certain other telecom assets  including certain other switching and voicemail equipment 
the changes were made effective january  the company s revisions have been supported by an assessment and report from an independent third party with expertise in this area that found the revisions to be reasonable in light of the company s plans and useful life estimates in comparable businesses 
during  this change in estimate decreased consolidated depreciation expense by  and consolidated net loss by  per share 
this change in accounting estimate decreased telecom depreciation expense and increased telecom income from operations by  in in addition  wireless depreciation expense and loss from operations decreased by approximately  in as a result of this change in accounting estimate 
this decrease was offset by the effects of additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily within the broadband segment 
during  the company plans to implement a strategy for driving efficiency and long term growth through cost reduction and workforce consolidation 
this strategic plan entails a reduction of operating expenses by approximately percent through a realignment of its organizational structure in order to focus on its primary customer segments 
the company also expects to eliminate functional redundancies  combine duplicate or overlapping work areas  consolidate separate billing and other systems and reduce overall labor costs 
adjustments and reclassification during the company s financial statement closing process for the year ended december   certain matters were identified related to prior financial reporting periods that necessitated the recording of adjustments to the company s consolidated financial statements 
such adjustments pertained principally to property  plant and equipment  and management believes that weaknesses in the company s internal controls caused the errors that resulted in these adjustments 
the company does not believe any of the aforementioned amounts are material  individually or in the aggregate  to the respective prior annual periods based on both quantitative factors  including the trend of operating results  nor does it believe the prospective correction of such amounts during the quarter ended december  is material to the company s consolidated results of operations based on both quantitative and qualitative factors  including the trend of operating results 
the prospective correction of the aforementioned amounts relating to prior periods reduced the company s consolidated net income by  or per basic and diluted share  and would have reduced the company s and consolidated net income by  or per basic and diluted share  and  or per basic and diluted share  respectively  had such errors been corrected in the periods in which they originated 
certain amounts in the company s and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement between the company and the customer exists  ii delivery of the product to the customer has occurred or service has been provided to the customer  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
revenues based on a flat fee  derived principally from local telephone  dedicated network access  data communications  internet access service  residential business broadband service and non contract wireless services  are billed in advance and recognized in subsequent periods when the services are provided

revenues based on usage  derived primarily from network access  roaming and long distance services  are recognized monthly as services are provided 
incremental direct costs of telecommunications service activation are charged to expense in the period in which they are incurred 
directory advertising revenues and costs related to publishing and distributing directories are recognized using the circulation period method  under which revenues and related costs are recognized ratably over the expected useful life of the directory  generally one year from the date of publication 
for all other operations  revenue is recognized when products are delivered or services are rendered to customers 
effective july   the company began applying the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
to all wireless handset sales below cost  which approximates fair value in the absence of an activation subsidy  when it receives an up front fee of any kind eg  a service activation fee 
the application of eitf issue no 
resulted in the immediate recognition of all or a portion of such up front fees as equipment sales revenue 
additionally  when the company activates wireless service for a customer  but does not concurrently provide the customer with a handset  any up front fees received continue to be deferred and amortized over the expected term of the customer relationship 
the company provides a general right of return within the first days of service for a refund of the handset cost 
the estimated equipment return allowance associated with this right of return is estimated based on historical experience

interstate access rates and resulting earnings are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission fcc 
with respect to interstate services  surewest telephone has filed its own tariff with the fcc for all elements of access services except carrier common line charges  for which surewest telephone concurs with tariffs filed by neca 
the fcc monitors surewest telephone s interstate earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by surewest telephone  which utilize estimated cost information and projected demand usage 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the preparation of the annual studies 
additionally  under current fcc rules governing rate making  surewest telephone is required to establish interstate rates based on projected demand usage for its various services and determine the actual earnings from these rates once actual volumes and costs are known

on july   the company entered into a settlement agreement with the other parties in the proceeding  the ora and the utility reform network turn  to resolve all issues in the proceeding 
in november the cpuc approved the settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement resolves existing sharing obligations and related earnings issues for the monitoring periods through  puts into place a surcredit mechanism for the amount of the settlement  and suspends the requirement for any intrastate sharing for monitoring periods from january  through at least december  the settlement agreement resulted in surewest telephone recognizing an increase in

for the year ended december   similar changes in accounting estimates decreased the company s revenues by  and net income by per share 
as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet reflected aggregate liabilities of relating to surewest telephone s estimated interstate shareable earnings obligations 
the calculations supporting these liabilities are very complex and involve a variety of estimates prior to the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
in addition  surewest telephone s interstate shareable earnings obligations lapse over time if surewest telephone s interexchange carrier and other customers do not claim the amounts ascribed to them 
accordingly  it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of the company s liabilities for interstate shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term  and the amounts involved could be material

management has discussed development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
as discussed more fully in note  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and wireless spectrum licenses are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
the impairment test for goodwill requires the company to estimate the fair value at the reporting unit level 
to determine 
table of contents the fair value in  the company obtained an independent valuation of the company s goodwill using a discounted cash flow model 
assumptions used in this model include the following cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities  distribution channels and customer base the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments and the company s business plans  an weighted average cost of capital based on industry weighted averaged cost of capital  and no terminal growth rate 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within the discounted cash flow model when determining fair value of the company s goodwill could result in a different fair value 
for example  the company used a discount rate of and no terminal growth rate in its assessment of fair value in if the discount rate were to increase two percent  the fair value of the goodwill would decrease by  but would not result in an impairment of goodwill 
the company s wireless spectrum licenses include personal communications services pcs and local multipoint distribution service lmds licenses 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s pcs licenses  the company obtained an independent valuation in  which reviewed transactions involving sales of comparable wireless spectrum licenses in the aftermarket  using characteristics of the license and the related market  including geographic location  market size  megahertz frequency and population density 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s lmds licenses  the company obtained an independent valuation  as comparable license sales data was not available 
the independent valuation estimates fair value of the company s lmds licenses using a discounted cash flow model 
assumptions used in this model include the following cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities  distribution channels and customer base the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments and the company s business plans  a weighted average cost of capital based on industry weighted averaged cost of capital adjusted to reflect the inherent risks associated with the introduction of a new service offering  and a terminal value growth rate 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within the discounted cash flow model when determining fair value of the company s lmds licenses could result in different values for these licenses 
for example  the company used a discount rate of and a terminal growth rate of in its assessment of fair value in if the discount rate were to increase one percent  the fair value of the lmds licenses would decrease by  which would result in an impairment charge of approximately based on the carrying value of the lmds licenses as of december  in addition  the company s lmds licenses may be impaired in the near future if the estimates and assumptions used in the lmds license discounted cash flow model are not met 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  then the carrying value is written down to the fair value 
as a result of the company s annual test for the current year  no impairment of either goodwill or pcs or lmds licenses was indicated 
as discussed more fully in note  total revenues from telephone services are affected by rates authorized by various regulatory agencies 
the fcc monitors surewest telephone s interstate earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by surewest telephone 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the preparation of the annual studies 
based on these rules  the company is required to prospectively set its annual interstate rates based on the aforementioned cost separation studies 
these cost studies include estimates and assumptions regarding various financial data including operating expenses  taxes and investment in property  plant and equipment 
non financial data estimates are also utilized in the preparation of these cost studies  including projected demand usage and detailed network information 
the company must also make estimates of the jurisdictional separation of this data to assign current financial 
table of contents and operating data to the interstate or intrastate jurisdiction 
these estimates are finalized in future periods as actual data becomes available to complete the separation studies 
additionally  certain fcc rules regarding interstate shareable earnings obligations have not yet been clarified as to whether the company s rate filings are deemed lawful and  therefore  protected from over earnings liability 
further  the company s separation studies include estimates and assumptions regarding issues before the fcc involving intercarrier interconnection  internet traffic  and traffic utilizing internet protocol 
the company also participates in the neca pool for certain interstate revenues 
in addition to the estimates noted above  the company s earned rate of return from its participation in the neca pool can also be impacted by the earnings and data of other carriers who participate in the pool 
in accordance with the nrf  surewest telephone is subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements by the cpuc  and it was initially required to share earnings with customers based on its earned annual rate of return 
the company utilizes models  which rely on estimates regarding the jurisdictional separation of financial data and operational data into the intrastate and interstate jurisdictions as discussed previously for the purposes of calculating its earned annual rate of return 
however  as discussed more fully in note  surewest telephone has entered into a settlement agreement  which was approved by the cpuc in november  to cease intrastate sharing requirements beginning january  through at least december  the settlement agreement also resolves existing sharing obligations and related earnings issues for the monitoring periods in addition  the company must make estimates and assumptions regarding various issues before the fcc and cpuc involving intercarrier interconnection  internet traffic  traffic utilizing internet protocol  methods used to allocate costs for services provided by surewest communications and surewest telephone to its affiliates and the treatment of certain plant and tax costs  including internal use software costs 
as a result of these estimates and assumptions  it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of surewest telephone s interstate shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term  and the amounts involved could be material 
for example  the cpuc approved a settlement agreement on november  that resolved the company s intrastate shareable earnings for the years through in accordance with this settlement agreement  the company recorded  in local revenues due to a change in accounting estimate in the fourth quarter of for a more detailed discussion regarding the settlement agreement  see regulation and contractual and estimated shareable earnings obligations within note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
this increase in revenue resulted in a decrease of the company s net loss by  per share 
in addition  in the company made changes in its estimates for interstate shareable earnings obligations for approximately  principally due to the dc circuit court of appeals decision issued in may  which determined that a tariff filed properly under section streamlined procedures and allowed to go into effect without suspension is deemed lawful 
therefore  the carrier is not subsequently obligated to pay refunds for earnings higher than the permitted rate of return as prescribed by the fcc for that monitoring period 
as discussed more fully in note  the company recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement between the company and the customer exists  ii delivery of the product to the customer has occurred or service has been provided to the customer  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
as discussed more fully in note  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of its customers to make required payments 
in evaluating the collectibility of its accounts receivable  the company assesses a number of factors including a specific customer s or carrier s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical and future expectations of conditions that may impact the company s ability to collect its accounts receivable 
if circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that the company s past collection experience is no longer relevant  the company s estimate of the recoverability of its accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
if uncollectibility of the company s billed revenue changes by  the company would expect an increase in uncollectible expense of approximately  as of december   the 
table of contents company had three customers that accounted for of consolidated accounts receivable in the aggregate 
although management believes that these customers are creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material effect on their ability to pay timely and  therefore  on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
in addition  certain revenues are subject to refund if the customer terminates services or returns equipment within a stipulated time period  or if certain performance criteria are not met 
accordingly  the company maintains accounts receivable allowances and recognizes certain customer refund liabilities  through charges to revenues  based on the company s best estimates of the resolution of these contingencies  which are based on historical experience 
as discussed more fully in note  the company states its inventories held for sale at lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories  the company is required to make estimates regarding future customer demand and technological advances of equipment 
as discussed more fully in note  property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost 
retirements and other reductions of regulated telephone plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized in accordance with the composite group remaining life methodology utilized for telephone plant assets 
when property applicable to non telephone operations is sold or retired  the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the associated gain or loss is recognized 
property  plant and equipment is depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives 
the economic lives are estimated at the time the assets are acquired and are based on historical experience with similar assets  as well as anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or differently than anticipated  the economic lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated  the life of the asset group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
the company reviews the estimated useful lives of its property  plant and equipment once every three years  or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s property  plant and equipment  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
as discussed in note  the company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires the company to recognize a retirement obligation future cost of removal when a legal obligation exists to remove plant at some point in the future 
the company believes it may have potential retirement obligations relating to its wireless cell sites 
based on terms outlined in its tower leases  the company is obligated to return the land or facilities to their original condition at the end of the cell site lease term  should the lease be terminated 
the company has used a probability weighted cash flow approach in estimating its potential retirement obligation 
the company calculates the net present value of the retirement obligation assuming an inflation rate of  a discount rate of and a market risk premium of 
the company has also assumed the settlement date is years from the date the asset is placed into service 
the company has also used a probability weighted assessment to address the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash flows to settle the potential liability 
the company believes that utilizing probabilities less than is appropriate because the company believes the likelihood of incurring material asset retirement expenditures is remote 
the company monitors the estimates and assumptions used in determining its potential asset retirement obligations for its cell sites 
however  the company believes it is remote that any future adjustment to its asset retirement liability for obligations existing as of december  will be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as discussed more fully in notes and  the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company does not have a valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset as of december  or because it believes 
table of contents it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset will be realized 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which the determination was made 
however  the company believes it will generate sufficient taxable income from future operations and reversal of deferred tax liabilities to realize the deferred tax asset of  as of december  as discussed more fully in note  the company has pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
the company s pension and post retirement benefit obligations are actuarially determined based on estimates of discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and increases in future compensation levels 
changes in these estimates and other factors could significantly impact the company s pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects percentage percentage point increase point decrease effect on total service and interest cost effect on post retirement benefit obligation as of december  the discount rate is determined based on the current yields on high quality corporate fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations 
as of december   the company used a discount rate of  which represents a reduction of basis points from the discount rate of as of december  this change in the discount rate did not have a material impact on the company s and consolidated results of operations 
in  the company used an expected long term rate of return of 
for  the company does not believe the expected long term rate will change significantly 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the current and projected investment portfolio mix and estimated long term investment returns for each asset class 
the projected portfolio mix of the plan assets is developed in consideration of the expected duration of related plan obligations and private equity positions 
the expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the expected long term rate of return to the market value of plan assets 
the future compensation levels are based on recent experience as well as future expectations 
as of december   the company reduced the future compensation level by basis points to and it remains at that level for this change in the future compensation level did not have a material impact on the company s and consolidated results of operations 
as discussed more fully in notes and  the company is a party to a variety of litigation  regulatory proceedings and other contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses for certain of these matters 
the determination of the liabilities required  if any  for loss contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate outcome of these matters will not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the company currently sponsors two equity incentive plans the plans for certain employees  outside directors and consultants of the company  which were approved by the company s shareholders 
the plans permit issuance by the company of awards in the form of restricted shares  stock units  performance shares  stock options and stock appreciation rights 
prior to  the company accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation expense for stock options was reflected in net income for the year ended december   as all stock

effective january   the company adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under the prospective transition method selected by the company  as described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  compensation expense was recognized in for all employee awards granted  modified or settled after january  this change in accounting for stock based compensation resulted in increased compensation expense of and  which increased net loss and decreased net income by no effect on loss per share and no effect on earnings per share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company voluntarily made the choice to change to the preferable method of accounting for employee stock options in accordance with sfas no 
the company concluded that stock options are a form of employee compensation expense and  therefore  it is appropriate that these expenses be recorded in the results of operations to more clearly reflect economic reality 
the black scholes merton option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect management s best estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the control of the company 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
if management uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years

in october  the fasb s eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are required to be divided into separate units of accounting under certain circumstances 
the company adopted eitf issue no 
on a prospective basis for arrangements entered into after june  the company has determined that the sale of its wireless handsets and the associated phone service provided by the wireless segment should be considered separate units of accounting under eitf issue no 
accordingly  beginning on july   the company began applying eitf issue no 
to all wireless handset sales below cost  which approximates fair value in the absence of an activation subsidy  when it receives an up front fee of any kind eg  a service activation fee 
the application of eitf issue no 
resulted in the immediate recognition of all or a portion of such up front fees as equipment sales revenue 

table of contents additionally  when the company activates wireless service for a customer  but does not concurrently provide the customer with a handset  any up front fees received continue to be deferred and amortized over the expected term of the customer relationship

factors that could affect future results as a result of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not necessarily be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
representative examples of these factors include without limitation the following we expect to continue to face significant competition in all parts of our business and the level of competition is expected to intensify 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
we face actual or potential competition from many existing and emerging companies  including other incumbent and competitive local telephone companies  long distance carriers and resellers  wireless telephone companies  internet service providers  satellite companies and cable television companies 
we may not be able to successfully anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including regulatory changes that may affect our competitors and us differently  new technologies and services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends and discount pricing strategies by competitors 
as the incumbent carrier in sacramento  sbc communications enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  favorable regulatory position  brand recognition and connection to virtually all of our customers and potential customers there 
as the largest cable operator in sacramento and placer county  comcast enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  ownership or superior access to programming and other content  brand recognition  and first in the field advantages with a customer base that generates positive cash flow for its operations 
we face intense competition in our markets for long distance  internet access and other ancillary services that are important to our business and to our growth strategy 
we must adapt to rapid technological change 
technological developments could increase our costs and cause a decline in demand for our services 
in addition  technology changes can reduce the costs of entry for others and give competitors significant new advantages 
if we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment that becomes obsolete  we will be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers  and we may be placed at a cost disadvantage in offering our services 
additionally  replacing or upgrading our infrastructure in the future could result in significant capital expenditures 
we are subject to a complex and uncertain regulatory environment 
some parts of our business are extensively regulated  and the nature of regulation continues to undergo fundamental change and reinterpretation 
many businesses that compete with the company are comparatively less regulated 
many significant regulatory decisions have had to be accommodated in recent years  and there are pending decisions on issues affecting the company that are of great importance 

table of contents our operations have undergone material changes  and our actual operating results can be expected to differ from the results indicated in our historical financial statements 
as a result of our acquisition of assets from win in  and the subsequent expansion of our cable television business  our mix of operating assets differs from those operations upon which our historical financial statements are based 
consequently  our historical financial statements may not be reliable as an indicator of future results 
our success depends upon our ability to manage our growth and expansion 
if our acquisitions and growth initiatives are not successful  we could suffer an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our growth strategy will continue to require us to invest significant capital in facilities and services that may not achieve the desired returns 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to manage our growth  including our ability to build network and related facilities to serve new customers  integrate our operations to take advantage of new capabilities and systems  attract and retain skilled personnel across the company  effectively manage the demands of day to day operations in new areas while attempting to execute our business strategy  and realize the projected growth and revenue targets developed by company management 
we are reliant on support funds provided under federal and state laws 
we receive revenues from various federal or state support funds interstate common line support from the universal service program  chcf b and universal lifeline service fund 
these governmental programs are reviewed and amended from time to time  and are likely to change in the near future 
as described in the regulation section above  the company currently receives funding of  annually from the chcf  a program designed by the cpuc to establish a fair and equitable local rate structure and to reduce any disparity in the rates charged by certain telephone companies serving high cost areas 
the chcf was due to expire on january  on september   the governor of california signed sb into law  which amended the existing legislation and extended the expiration date to january  the outcome and impact on the company s operations resulting from future changes to these governmental programs cannot be determined at this time 
we could be harmed by the recent adverse developments affecting other communications companies 
there have been numerous bankruptcies and other financial difficulties experienced by other carriers and suppliers in the telecommunications and internet sectors 
similar situations with our suppliers  some of whom provide products and services for which there are few substitutes  could cause us to experience delays  service interruptions or additional expenses 
situations with carrier and other customers could affect our ability to collect services that have been provided 
we depend on third parties  over whom we have no control  to deliver our services 
because of the interconnected nature of the telecommunications industry  we depend heavily on other local telephone companies  long distance carriers  and numerous other third parties to deliver our services 
in addition  we are dependent on easements  franchises and licenses from various private parties such as established telephone companies and other utilities  railroads  long distance companies  and from state highway authorities  local governments and transit authorities for access to aerial pole space  underground conduits and other rights of way in order to construct and operate our networks 
the failure to maintain in effect the necessary third party arrangements on acceptable terms would have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
we are subject to new corporate governance and internal control reporting requirements  and our failure to comply with existing and future requirements could adversely affect our business 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section and related securities and exchange commission rules  we have furnished a report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls at december  in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm audited and reported on  management s assessment 
management concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective at december  if our deficiencies are not adequately addressed  we could experience accounting errors that could result in misstatements of our financial position and results of operations  potential restatements of our financial statements or otherwise adversely affect our business  reputation and results of operations 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities 

table of contents if we are unable to effectively and efficiently implement the necessary initiatives to eliminate the material weakness identified in our internal controls and procedures  there could be an adverse affect on our operations or financial results 
in connection with the management s report on internal control over financial reporting  management identified a material weakness in the company s internal control over financial reporting relating to the accounting for property  plant and equipment  which resulted from a control weakness that caused the following conditions the company was unable to completely reconcile its plant in service and plant under construction subsidiary ledgers to the corresponding general ledger balances for periods throughout and as of december  management believes these unreconciled differences are attributable principally to deficiencies in the reliability of the company s information system interfaces between the general ledger and the property  plant and equipment subsidiary ledgers 
in addition  during  several errors occurred in the company s periodic depreciation and capitalized interest calculations that were more than inconsequential 
additionally  as of december   the company did not have effective procedures with which to determine the cost bases of property  plant and equipment that had been retired 
moreover  certain manual internal controls pertaining to property  plant and equipment implemented by the company during the third quarter of were not operating effectively as of december  these matters required the company to record adjustments to both its annual and interim consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounts affected by this material weakness are property  plant and equipment and related accumulated depreciation included in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and depreciation expense and interest expense included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
due to this material weakness  management believes that as of december   the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission criteria 
during the year ended december   we implemented various initiatives  and will be implementing additional initiatives in to improve our internal controls  and address the matters discussed in management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
the implementation of the initiatives and the consideration of additional necessary improvements are among our highest priorities 
the board of directors  under the direction of the audit committee  will continually assess the progress of the initiatives and the improvements  and take further actions as deemed necessary 
until the identified material weakness is eliminated  there is a risk of an adverse affect on our operations or financial results
