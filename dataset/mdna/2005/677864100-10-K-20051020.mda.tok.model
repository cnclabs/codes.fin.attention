the company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that its financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies stated in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the policies listed below involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates included inventory reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts and the amount of prepaid overburden 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
under the terms of its sales agreements with customers  the company recognizes revenue when title is transferred 
upon shipment an invoice is generated that sets the fixed and determinable price 
sales returns and allowances  which have historically not been material  are reviewed to determine if any additional reserve is necessary 
sales returns and allowances are not material due to the nature of the company s business 
allowance for doubtful accounts are evaluated by the company utilizing a combination of a historical percentage of sales by division and specific customer account analysis 
the company maintains and monitors a list of customers whose creditworthiness has diminished 
this list is used as part of the specific customer account analysis 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs include the cost of raw materials  packaging supplies  labor and other overhead costs 
the company performs a detailed review of its inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment is necessary 
the review surveys all of the company s operating facilities and sales divisions to ensure that both historical issues and new market trends are considered

a significant part of the company s overall mining cost is incurred during the process of removing the overburden non usable material from the mine site  thus exposing the sorbent material that is then used in a majority of the company s production processes 
the cost of the overburden removal is recorded in a prepaid expense account and  as the usable sorbent material is mined  the prepaid overburden removal expense is amortized over the estimated available material 
the company had  and  of prepaid expense recorded on its consolidated balance sheet  as of july  and july   respectively 
the company amortized to current expense approximately  of previously recorded prepaid expense in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal to determine the value of prepaid overburden  the company s mining personnel survey the individual mining areas 
the estimation work is conducted utilizing a combination of manual and computerized survey tools 
once the survey data is recorded it is charted on numerous topographical maps of the mining areas 
finally based on the survey data  maps and professional judgment of the mining engineers estimates are developed 
during the normal course of the company s overburden removal activities the company performs on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a pit  it is hauled to a previously mined pit and used to refill the older site 
this process allows the company to continuously reclaim older pits and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the liability for the reclamation function 
additionally  it is oil dri s policy to capitalize the purchase cost of land and mineral rights  including associated legal fees  survey fees and real estate fees 
the costs of obtaining mineral patents  including legal fees and drilling expenses  are also capitalized 
development costs of determining the nature and amount of mineral reserves and any prepaid royalties that are offsetable against future royalties due upon extraction of the mineral are also capitalized

accordingly  the company has not recorded any compensation expense associated with its issuance of stock options 
the company has recorded as expense the fair market value on the date of issue of any restricted stock awards granted 
the fair value of the issued stock options is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing method 
had the company accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payments  the company would have reported in  and additional employee compensation expense net of related tax effect of approximately   and  respectively 
pension accounting 
pension benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurement 
the company evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined based on a building block approach 
the expected long term rate of inflation and risk premiums for the various asset categories are based on general historical returns and inflation rates 
the target allocation of assets is used to develop a composite rate of return assumption 
the discount rate is based on a market benchmark rate that is of comparable duration to the plan s liabilities 
specifically  the discount rate was based on the moody s aa corporate bond yield adjusted to be based on annual compounding 
the rate was rounded to the nearest basis points

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk and employs policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company had two interest rate swap agreements as of july  the company believes that the market risk arising from holdings of its financial instruments is not material 
the company is exposed to currency risk as it relates to certain accounts receivables and the company s foreign operations 
the company believes that the currency risk is immaterial to the overall presentation of the financial statements 
the company is exposed to regulatory risk in the fluid purification and agricultural markets  principally as a result of the risk of increasing regulation of the food chain in the united states and europe 
the company actively monitors developments in this area  both directly and through trade organizations of which it is a member 
the company is exposed to commodity price risk with respect to natural gas 
the company has contracted for a portion of its fuel needs for fiscal using forward purchase contracts to manage the volatility related to this exposure 
these contracts will reduce the volatility in fuel prices  and the weighted average cost of these contracts has been estimated to be approximately higher than the contracts for fiscal these contracts were entered into during the normal course of business and no contracts were entered into for speculative purposes 
the table below provides information about the company s natural gas future contracts  which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices  specifically natural gas prices 
for the future contracts the table presents the notional amounts in mmbtu s  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount  which will mature by july  the fair value was determined using the most recent settle price for the henry hub natural gas option contract prices as listed by the new york mercantile exchange on september  commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ending july  expected maturity fair value natural gas future volumes mmbtu weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands factors that could influence the fair value of the natural gas contracts  include  but are not limited to  the creditworthiness of the company s natural gas suppliers  the overall general economy  developments in world events  and the general demand for natural gas by the manufacturing sector  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
some of these same events have allowed the company to mitigate the impact of the natural gas contracts by the continued and in some cases expanded use of recycled oil in our manufacturing processes 
accurate estimates of the impact that these contracts may have on the company s fiscal financial results are difficult to make due to the inherent uncertainty of future fluctuations in option contract prices in the natural gas options market
