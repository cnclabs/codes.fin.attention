management s focus on shifting product mix away from traditional lumber building materials continues and has been the reason for increased sales in recent years 
we continued to experience a decrease in sales in the area of lumber and building materials that management believes is due to recessionary conditions in the economy  causing customers to scale back their purchases of these discretionary items 
the loss of revenue from these products has been offset by the sales increases in our other business segments  however  we believe that once consumer confidence strengthens  lumber and building material sales will again trend upward 
we have also introduced new products for retailers  which  in the past  concentrated on more expensive items

on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions

r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r supersedes apb and its related implementation guidance by requiring entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions and revises sfas as follows i public entities are required to measure liabilities incurred to employees in share based payment transactions at fair value and nonpublic entities may elect to measure their liabilities to employees incurred in share based payment transactions at their intrinsic value whereas under sfas  all share based payment liabilities were measured at their intrinsic value 
ii nonpublic entities are required to calculate fair value using an appropriate industry sector index for the expected volatility of its share price if it is not practicable to estimate the expected volatility of the entity s share price 
iii entities are required to estimate the number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered as opposed to accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
iv incremental compensation cost for a modification of the terms or conditions of an award is measured by comparing the fair value of the modified award with the fair value of the award immediately before the modification whereas sfas required that the effects of a modification be measured as the difference between the fair value of the modified award at the date it is granted and the award s value immediately before the modification determined based on the shorter of its remaining initially estimated expected life or the expected life of the modified award 
sfas r also clarifies and expands guidance in several areas  including measuring fair value  classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company did not have any derivative financial instruments as of the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
therefore  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents as well as interest paid on debt 
the company has lines of credit and other debt whose interest rates are based on various published prime rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment 
the company is subject to interest rate risk and could be subject to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
the company does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
foreign currency risk the company operates primarily in the united states  however  some business is transacted with canadian firms 
the company s business and financial condition is  therefore  sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on its currency
