the audited consolidated financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended december   and in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a global leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of rapid  accurate and cost effective nucleic acid probe based products used for the clinical diagnosis of human diseases and for the screening of donated human blood 
we have over years of nucleic acid detection research and product development experience  and our products  which are based on our patented nucleic acid testing  or nat  technology  are used daily in clinical laboratories and blood collection centers in major countries throughout the world 
in september  our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market 
as a publicly traded company  we have achieved strong growth in both revenues and earnings due principally to the success of our blood screening products which are used to detect the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type  or hiv  and hepatitis c virus  or hcv  and hepatitis b  or hbv 
under our collaboration agreement with chiron corporation  or chiron  we are responsible for the research  development  regulatory process and manufacturing of our blood screening products while chiron is responsible for marketing  sales  distribution and service of those products 
recent events financial results during  we achieved strong financial results 
net income for the year was million per diluted share  compared to million per diluted share in  an increase of 
total revenues for were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
product sales for were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
during  net income and total revenues included a contract milestone of million from chiron and a license fee of million earned in connection with our cross licensing agreement with tosoh corporation  or tosoh 
these amounts added approximately to diluted earnings per share and million to revenues 
corporate collaborations in january  biom rieux and its affiliates exercised an option to develop diagnostic products for certain undisclosed disease targets using our patented ribosomal rna technologies  pursuant to the terms of a september agreement 
in exchange for these rights  biom rieux and its affiliates paid us a million license fee 
we have recorded million of the cumulative payments million license fee and million option fee as license revenue in the first quarter of  based on the total number of targets that may eventually be selected 
the amount and timing of additional revenue that we record will depend on the number of additional targets  if any  selected by biom rieux  which also has options to develop diagnostic products for other disease targets by paying us up to an additional million by the end of further  we will receive royalties on the sale of any products developed by biom rieux using our intellectual property 

table of contents in january  we also entered into a license agreement with corixa corporation  or corixa  and received the right to develop molecular diagnostic tests for approximately potential genetic markers in the areas of prostate  ovarian  cervical  kidney  lung and colon cancers 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we paid corixa an initial access license fee of million and agreed to pay an additional million in two equal access fees of million on january  and january   unless we terminate the agreement prior to those dates 
we expect to record the initial million license fee as an intangible asset which will be amortized over the underlying life of the patents or the term of our rights to these patents  whichever expires sooner 
we also agreed to pay corixa milestone payments totaling an additional million on a product by product basis based on the occurrence of certain regulatory and or commercial events 
further  we agreed to pay corixa additional milestone payments and royalties on net sales of any products developed by us using corixa s technology 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with adnagen ag  or adnagen  to gain access to technology that may help increase the accuracy of molecular diagnostic tests to detect prostate and other cancers 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid adnagen a license fee of million  and agreed to pay  on the later of february  or upon issuance to adnagen of a patent containing valid claims that cover products licensed under the agreement 
we recorded the million license fee as r d expense in since we have not yet determined technological feasibility and do not currently have alternative future plans to use this technology other than for our prostate cancer development program 
upon the occurrence of certain clinical  regulatory and or commercial events  we agreed to pay adnagen up to three milestone payments totaling an additional million 
further  we agreed to pay adnagen royalties on net sales of any products we develop using adnagen s technology 
in november  we entered into an exclusive option agreement with qualigen  inc to develop and commercialize a point of use nat instrument based on qualigen s fda approved fastpack immunoassay system 
if successfully developed  the portable instrument would use our nat technology to detect  at the point of sample collection  the presence of harmful microorganisms and genetic mutations 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid qualigen million for an month option to license  on an exclusive basis  qualigen s technology to develop nat assays for the clinical diagnostics  blood screening and industrial fields 
during this period  we intend to evaluate the feasibility of adapting qualigen s immunoassay platform to perform nat using our proprietary technologies 
if we exercise this option  at our sole discretion  then we have agreed to purchase shares of qualigen preferred stock convertible into approximately of qualigen s then outstanding fully diluted common shares outstanding 
the cost of acquiring this equity interest would vary between and million  depending on the timing of the option exercise 
in addition  we may pay qualigen up to million in license fees based on development milestones  and agreed to pay royalties on any product sales 
we recorded the million option fee as an intangible asset which is being amortized over the month evaluation period of the option or until execution of the license  whichever comes first 
in september  we entered into a settlement agreement and an amendment to our non exclusive license agreement with vysis  inc  or vysis  under which the company withdrew its patent litigation against vysis and agreed to pay vysis an aggregate of million 
this amount included million for a fully paid up license to eliminate all future royalty obligations of the company to vysis under the collins patent covered by the license  and million for a fully paid up  royalty free license in additional fields under the collins patent 
the company had been paying royalties under a pre existing license agreement which has since been amended 
the license now covers current and future products in the field of infectious diseases  as well as potential products in all other fields 
chiron reimbursed us million of the million allocated to the cost of the fully paid up license for the current field  commensurate with its obligation under their collaboration agreement with us to reimburse the company a portion of the royalties paid by the company to vysis on blood screening products 
we recorded the million net payment million less chiron s million reimbursement to vysis as an intangible asset  which is being amortized to cost of goods sold over the patent s remaining economic life of months 

table of contents supply agreements in february  we entered into a supply and purchase agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
and its affiliate roche molecular systems  inc  or roche 
under this agreement  roche will manufacture and supply dna probes for human papillomavirus  or hpv 
we will use these probes in molecular diagnostic assays 
pursuant to the agreement  we will pay roche manufacturing fees of million within days of february  and million within days of the occurrence of certain future commercial events 
we also agreed to pay roche transfer fees for the hpv products 
product development we submitted a biologics license application  or bla  for the west nile virus  or wnv  assay to the us federal drug administration  or fda  during the first quarter of approximately infected units have been intercepted using our wnv assay since july of in addition  our high throughput tigris instrument was used by several blood centers to screen both individual donor and pooled blood donations for wnv 
we submitted a bla for the procleix ultrio hiv hcv hbv assay to the fda during the third quarter of we intend to seek approval to run the test on both the semi automated procleix system and on the fully automated tigris instrument 
we also submitted a regulatory application to european officials to run the procleix ultrio assay on our tigris instrument 
in january  the procleix ultrio assay  running on our semi automated instrument system  received its community european  or ce  mark  which permitted chiron to launch the product in the european economic area 
our tigris instrument and our procleix ultrio assay for use on the tigris instrument  received ce marks in december revenues we derive revenues from three primary sources product sales  collaborative research revenue and royalty and license revenue 
the majority of our revenues come from product sales  which consist primarily of sales of our nat assays tested on our proprietary instruments that serve as the analytical platform for our assays 
we recognize as collaborative research revenue payments we receive from chiron for the products we provided under our collaboration agreements with chiron prior to regulatory approval  and the payments we receive from chiron  bayer corporation  or bayer  and other collaboration partners  including the national institutes of health  or nih  for research and development activities 
our royalty and license revenues reflect fees paid to us by third parties for the use of our proprietary technology 
in  product sales  collaborative research revenues and royalty and license revenues equaled  and  respectively  of our total revenues of million 
product sales our primary source of revenue is the sale of clinical diagnostic products in the united states  which include our aptima combo  pace  accuprobe and amplified mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test product lines 
during  we shipped approximately million tests for the diagnosis of a wide variety of infectious microorganisms  including those causing sexually transmitted diseases  or stds  tuberculosis  strep throat  pneumonia and fungal infections 
the principal customers for our clinical diagnostics products include large reference laboratories  public health laboratories and hospitals located in north america  europe and japan 
since  we have supplied nat assays for use in screening blood donations intended for transfusion 
our primary blood screening assay detects hiv and hcv in donated human blood 
our blood screening assays and instruments are marketed through our collaboration with chiron under the procleix and ultrio trademarks 
we recognize product sales from the manufacture and shipment of tests for screening donated blood at a contractual transfer price  through our collaboration with chiron  to blood bank facilities located in the countries where our products have obtained governmental approvals 
blood screening product sales are then adjusted monthly corresponding to chiron s payment to us of amounts reflecting our ultimate share of net revenue from sales by chiron to the end user  less the transfer price revenues previously recorded 
net sales 
table of contents are ultimately equal to the sales of the assays by chiron to third parties  less freight  duty and certain other adjustments specified in our agreement with chiron  multiplied by our share of the net revenue 
our share of the net revenue was with respect to sales of assays that include a test for hcv beginning the second quarter of following fda approval in february upon implementation of commercial pricing  through april   after which our share of net revenues from sales of assays that include a test for hcv was adjusted to 
effective january   our share of net revenues from commercial sales of assays that include a test for hcv was permanently changed to under our agreement with chiron 
with respect to commercial sales of blood screening assays under our collaboration with chiron that do not include a test for hcv  such as possible future commercial tests for wnv  we will continue to receive reimbursement for our manufacturing costs plus of net revenues 
our costs related to these products primarily include manufacturing costs 
collaborative research revenue we have recorded revenues related to use of our blood screening products in the united states and other countries in which the products have not received regulatory approval as collaborative research revenue  because price restrictions applied to these products prior to fda license approval in the united states and similar approvals in foreign countries 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  as collaborative research revenue through our collaboration with chiron from deliveries of wnv tests on a cost recovery basis 
our nat assay to detect wnv is currently being used in clinical trials under an investigational new drug  or ind  application 
in  we recognized million in reimbursements for expenses incurred for wnv 
we expect to continue recognizing these sales as collaborative research revenue until fda approval has been received  although there is no guarantee we ultimately will receive fda approval 
in march  we signed a definitive agreement with chiron for the development and commercialization of the procleix ultrio assay 
in  we recognized million in reimbursements for expenses incurred related to the development of this assay 
we expect to receive further reimbursement from chiron for certain costs incurred during the development of the procleix ultrio and wnv assays 
in january  we commenced clinical trials of the procleix ultrio assay in the united states on our tigris instrument 
in september  we filed a bla with the fda for this assay 
we recognize collaborative research revenue over the term of our strategic alliance agreement with chiron as reimbursable costs are incurred 
the costs associated with the reported collaborative research revenue are based on fully burdened full time equivalent  or fte  rates and are reflected in our statements of income under the captions research and development  marketing and sales and general and administrative  based on the nature of the costs 
we do not separately track all of the costs applicable to our blood screening development collaboration with chiron and  therefore  are not able to quantify all of the direct costs associated with the collaborative research revenue 
since  we have been awarded contracts aggregating approximately million by the nih to develop nat assays for screening donated blood for hiv  hcv  hepatitis b virus  or hbv  and wnv 
to date  all payments due to us under these reimbursement contracts have been received and have been recorded as collaborative research revenues as reimbursable costs were incurred 
as of december   the company has billed all monies remaining under these contracts 
royalty and license revenue we recognize non refundable up front license fees over the performance period of the applicable agreement or at the time that we have satisfied all substantive performance obligations under such agreement 
we also receive milestone payments for successful achievement of contractual development activities 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones when i we have earned the milestone payment  ii the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and iii the fees are non refundable 

table of contents any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
in december  we entered into an agreement with tosoh to cross license intellectual property covering certain nat technologies 
the licenses  which were effective january   cover products in clinical diagnostics and other related fields 
under the agreement  tosoh received non exclusive rights to our proprietary transcription mediated amplification  or tma  and rrna technologies in exchange for two payments to us totaling million 
these payments were recognized as revenue in the first quarter of as there were no additional obligations placed on us after the effective date of the contract and the transfer of rights to the technology 
further  tosoh agreed to pay us royalties on worldwide sales of any future products that employ our technologies licensed by tosoh 
we also have gained access  in exchange for the payment of royalties  to tosoh s patented transcription reverse transcription concerted  or trc  amplification and intercalation activating fluorescence  or inaf  detection technologies for use with our real time tma technology 
under the strategic alliance agreement we entered into with chiron in june  we have responsibility for research  development and manufacturing of the blood screening products covered by the agreement  while chiron has responsibility for marketing  distribution and service of the blood screening products worldwide 
during the first quarter of  we recognized as royalty and license revenue  a million milestone payment from chiron as we commenced clinical trials of the procleix ultrio assay on our tigris instrument in the united states 
an additional payment of million is due to us in the future under the agreement if we obtain fda approval of our ultrio assay for use on the tigris instrument 
there is no guarantee we will achieve these milestones and receive any additional milestone payments under this agreement 
cost of product sales cost of product sales includes direct material  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead associated with the production of inventory on a standard cost basis 
indirect cost elements  which include manufacturing variances  purchase price variances  and allowances for scrap are also included as a component of cost of product sales  as well as certain related expenses  such as royalties  warranty  and instrument amortization 
in addition  we manufacture significant quantities of raw materials  development lots  and clinical trial lots of product prior to receiving fda approval for commercial sale 
during and  our manufacturing facilities produced development lots for wnv and procleix ultrio assays 
the majority of costs associated with these development lots are classified as research and development expense 
the portion of a development lot that is manufactured to support in vitro diagnostic  or ivd  sales abroad is charged to inventory and classified as cost of product sales upon shipment 
our blood screening manufacturing facility has operated below its capacity and will continue to operate below its potential capacity for the foreseeable future 
a portion of this available capacity is utilized for research and development activities as new product offerings are developed for commercialization 
as a result  certain operating costs of our blood screening facility  together with other manufacturing costs for the production of pre commercial development lot assays that are delivered under the terms of an ind application  are classified as research and development expense prior to fda approval 
effective january   our revenue sharing percentage with chiron was reduced from to 
this change  combined with higher instrument costs  including the amortization of our capitalized software development costs which we began to amortize in and related service costs attributed to the general commercial launch of our tigris instrument  contributed to lower gross margin percentage levels 
in addition  our non military customers currently utilize pooled blood screening samples for testing 
we anticipate that requirements for smaller pool sizes or ultimately individual donor testing  if and when implemented  could result in lower gross margin rates  as additional tests would be required to deliver the sample results  unless a corresponding increase in sales pricing is implemented 
we are not able to accurately predict the extent to which our gross margin may be affected as a result of smaller pool sizes or individual donor testing because we do not know the ultimate selling price that chiron  our distributor  would charge to the end user if smaller pool sizes or individual donor testing is implemented 

table of contents research and development we invest significantly in research and development  or r d  as part of our ongoing efforts to develop new products and technologies 
our r d expenses include the development of proprietary products and instrument platforms  as well as expenses related to the co development of new products and technologies in collaboration with our strategic partners 
r d spending is expected to increase in the future due to new product development  clinical trial costs and clinical manufacturing costs  however  we expect our r d expenses as a percentage of total revenues to decline in future years 
the timing of clinical trials and development manufacturing costs is variable and is affected by product development activities and the regulatory process 
in connection with our r d efforts  we have various license agreements which provide us with rights to develop and market products using certain technologies and patent rights maintained by third parties 
these agreements generally provide for a term that commences upon execution of the agreement and continues until expiration of the last patent related to the technologies covered by the license 
r d expenses include the costs of raw materials  development lots and clinical trial lots of products that we manufacture 
these costs are dependent on the status of projects under development and may vary substantially between quarterly or annual reporting periods 
during  we expect to incur further incremental costs associated with the manufacture of developmental lots and clinical trial lots for our blood screening products and with further development of our tigris instrument 
collaborative research revenues associated with these types of incurred costs have at times been realized in a period later than when incurred due to the need for further clarity on the extent of reimbursable costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of inventories  long lived assets including patent costs and capitalized software  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we record shipments of our clinical diagnostic products as product sales when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from our blood screening products shipped to countries where regulatory approval has been received is recorded as product sales based on a contracted transfer price with our third party collaboration partner  chiron 
based on the terms of our agreement with chiron  our ultimate share of the net revenue from sales to the end user is not known until reported by chiron 
we manufacture our blood screening products according to chiron s demand specifications and transfer shipment of completed product to chiron s virtual warehouse  which consists of various interim locations on our premises 
upon transfer shipment of completed product to chiron s virtual warehouse  we bill chiron at a cost recovery transfer price  and chiron remits payment in days 
we record amounts billed as deferred revenue until product shipment is made to chiron s end customers 
customer orders for the assay are received by chiron and then communicated to our personnel who fulfill the orders and ship to chiron s 
table of contents end customers 
upon shipment to the end customer  we recognize blood screening product sales at the transfer price and record cost of products sold at the cost of our assays 
blood screening product sales are adjusted upon our receipt of payment from chiron of amounts reflecting our ultimate share of net sales by chiron of these products  less the transfer price revenues previously paid 
product sales also include the sales or rental value associated with the delivery of our proprietary integrated instrument platforms that perform our nat assays 
generally  we provide our instrumentation to clinical laboratories and hospitals without requiring them to purchase the equipment or enter into an equipment lease 
instead  we recover the cost of providing the instrumentation in the amounts we charge for our diagnostic assays 
the costs associated with an instrument are charged to costs of product sales on a straight line basis over the estimated life of an instrument  which ranges from three to five years  generally  three years for luminometers and dts systems  and five years for tigris and dts systems 
the costs to maintain these systems in the field are charged to operations as incurred 
we sell our instrumentation to chiron for use in blood screening and record these instrument sales upon delivery since chiron is responsible for the placement  maintenance and repair of the units with their customers 
occasionally  we sell instrumentation to our clinical diagnostics customers 
we record sales of these instruments as product sales upon delivery and receipt of customer acceptance 
prior to delivery  each instrument is extensively tested to meet company and fda specifications  and is shipped fully assembled 
customer acceptance of our instrument systems requires installation and training by our technical service personnel 
generally  installation is a standard process consisting principally of uncrating  calibrating  and testing the instrumentation 
we record as collaborative research revenue shipments of our blood screening products in the united states and other countries in which the products have not received regulatory approval 
we do this because price restrictions apply to these products prior to fda marketing approval in the united states and similar approvals in foreign countries 
as commercial pricing is implemented  we classify sales of these products as product sales in our financial statements 
we recognize collaborative research revenue over the term of various collaboration agreements as negotiated monthly contracted amounts are earned or reimbursable costs are incurred related to that agreement 
negotiated monthly contracted amounts are earned in relative proportion to the performance required under the contracts 
non refundable license fees are recognized over the related performance period or at the time that we have satisfied all performance obligations related to the agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones when i we have earned the milestone payment  ii the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and iii the fees are non refundable 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we recognize royalty revenue related to the manufacture  sale or use of our products or technologies under license agreements with third parties 
for those arrangements where royalties are reasonably estimable  we recognize revenue based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjust for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
historically  these adjustments have not been material 
for those arrangements where royalties are not reasonably estimable  we recognize revenue upon receipt of royalty statements from the applicable licensee 
collectibility of accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit losses historically have been minimal and within management s expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 

table of contents valuation of inventories we record valuation adjustments to our inventory balances for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of such inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand and the shelf life and expiration dates for finished goods and materials used in the manufacturing process 
we operate in an environment that is regulated by the fda and other governmental agencies that may place restrictions on our ability to sell our products into the marketplace if certain compliance requirements are not met 
we have made assumptions that are reflected in arriving at our net inventory value based on the information currently available to us 
if future product demand  regulatory constraints or other market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory valuation reserves may be required 
we also manufacture products to conduct developmental evaluations and clinical trials and to validate our manufacturing practices prior to receiving regulatory clearance or for commercial sale of our products 
in these circumstances  uncertainty exists regarding our ability to sell these products until the fda or other governing bodies commercially approve them 
accordingly  the manufacturing costs of these items in inventory are recorded as r d expense 
in cases where we manufacture products that are sold into approved markets and also maintained for further development evaluations for other markets  we may also provide valuation allowances for this inventory due to the historical uncertainties associated with regulated product introductions 
to the extent any of these previously manufactured products are sold to end users  we record revenues  subject to any applicable adjustments in royalty rates under our collaboration agreements with chiron and others  and reduce any inventory reserves that are directly applicable to such products 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is reviewed at least annually  generally in the fourth quarter of each year 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreased market capitalization relative to net book value 
when there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
capitalized software costs we capitalize costs incurred in the development of computer software related to products under development after establishment of technological feasibility 
these capitalized costs are recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are amortized over the estimated life of the related product 
at december   capitalized software development costs related to our tigris instrument totaled million  net of accumulated amortization 
we completed beta evaluations of this instrument for clinical diagnostic applications and undertook initial beta trials for blood screening applications before we completed a clinical trial for a diagnostic application in june in december  we received approval from the fda for testing certain stds on our tigris instrument 
we initiated clinical trials of our procleix ultrio assay on our tigris instrument for a blood screening application in january and filed a bla with the fda for this assay in the third quarter of if we are not able to successfully deliver this instrument to the 
table of contents marketplace and attain customer acceptance  the asset could be impaired and an adjustment to the carrying value of this asset would be considered by management at that time 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  we began amortizing the capitalized software costs on a straight line basis over months during may  coinciding with the general release of tigris instruments to our customers 
income taxes through december   we were included in the consolidated federal and in various combined state income tax returns of our former parent company  gen probe holding company  inc  formerly known as chugai pharma usa  inc 
pursuant to a tax sharing agreement with gen probe holding company  we generally were allocated an amount of the consolidated tax liability equal to the tax that would have been applicable if computed separately 
at december   we had net deferred tax liabilities of million  which relate to capitalized costs expensed for tax purposes and other items 
these amounts are offset by research and investment credits filed in our tax returns  and timing differences arising from the recording of deferred revenue and certain reserves and accruals 
in connection with our merger with gen probe holding company in  we recorded approximately million of deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets related principally to financial statement depreciation in excess of that deducted for tax purposes and to research and development tax credits previously held by chugai pharma usa  llc  the successor to our former sister company chugai biopharmaceuticals  inc  which have been included in our combined tax returns 
these deferred tax assets may be realized in future periods depending on  among other factors  whether we have sufficient future taxable income 
the deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation reserve until these deductions and credits are realized 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to reduce the deferred tax asset would be made in the period such determination was made 
it is our policy to establish reserves based upon management s assessment of exposure for tax credits claimed in previously filed tax returns that may become payable upon audits by tax authorities 
the tax reserves are analyzed at least annually and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustments to the reserve 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth operating data as a percentage of total revenues years ended december total revenues product sales collaborative research revenue royalty and license revenue operating expenses cost of product sales research and development marketing and sales general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations total other income expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole percentage product sales product sales increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was principally the result of a million increase in worldwide commercial sales of our procleix blood screening products  both in the united states and international markets  and a million increase in std product sales  primarily aptima 
procleix blood screening product sales represented million  or of product sales in  compared to million  or of product sales  in we expect competitive pressures related to our std and blood screening products to continue into the foreseeable future  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market and continuing pricing pressure 
collaborative research revenue collaborative research revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in firm support commitment payments in connection with the wnv tests provided to united states customers through our collaboration with chiron  and a million increase in revenue for reimbursement from chiron for wnv development costs 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue from the nih as our wnv funding was completed during and a million decrease in revenue for reimbursement from chiron of our development costs incurred on the procleix ultrio assay 
collaborative research revenue tends to fluctuate based on the amount of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of our collaborative research revenues  results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
our ability to generate additional collaborative research revenues depends  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
these 
table of contents relationships may not be established or maintained and current collaborative research revenue may decline 
shortly after fda approval of our procleix and ultrio assays  we would expect chiron to implement commercial pricing related to the use of these products which would result in an increase in product sales partially offset by a decrease in collaborative research revenue 
royalty and license revenue royalty and license revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was principally attributed to i million in license fees earned from tosoh as part of our non exclusive licensing agreement relating to nat technologies effective in january  and ii a million milestone payment from chiron as we began clinical trial testing of the procleix ultrio assay on our fully automated tigris instrument in the united states 
further  we recognized million of license revenue from bayer during for the licensing of rights to certain patented technology 
royalty and license revenue may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements and the timing of receipt of license fees 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
we may not be able to do so and future royalty and license revenue may decline 
cost of product sales cost of product sales increased million to million  or of product sales revenues in  from million  or of product sales revenues in the million increase in cost of sales was principally attributed to the volume increase in product sales  higher allowances for scrap expense and the amortization of capitalized software development costs related to our tigris instrument 
cost of product sales may fluctuate significantly in future periods based on changes in production volumes for both commercially approved products and products under development or in clinical trials 
cost of product sales are also affected by manufacturing efficiencies  allowances for scrap or expired materials  additional costs related to initial production quantities of new products after achieving fda approval  and contractual adjustments  such as instrumentation costs  instrument service costs and royalties 
our gross profit margin on product sales decreased to in  from in the decrease was primarily the result of higher scrap expense of million  including expiration of enzymes that were produced in support of the procleix bla  increased sales of lower margin products including tigris instruments  unfavorably impacting margin by approximately million  and the amortization of capitalized software development costs of million  which began in the second quarter of  partially offset by lower unit costs on sales volume increases 
we anticipate that requirements for smaller pool sizes or ultimately individual donor testing  if and when implemented  could result in lower gross margin rates as additional tests would be required to deliver the sample results  unless a corresponding increase in sales pricing structure is implemented

our expenditures for capital additions vary based on the stage of certain development projects and may increase in the future related to the timing of development of new product opportunities and to support expansion of our facilities in connection with those opportunities 
the average age of our property  plant and equipment is approximately five years  which provides us flexibility in planning capital expenditures 

table of contents the million increase in net cash provided by financing activities during was principally attributed to a million increase in employee purchases of our common stock made through our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  and a million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on a going forward basis  cash from financing activities will be affected by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and receipts from sales of stock under our espp 
we expect fluctuations to occur throughout the year  as the amount and frequency of stock related transactions are dependent upon the market performance of our common stock  along with other factors 
we have an unsecured bank line of credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which expires in july  under which we may borrow up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula  at the bank s prime rate  or at libor plus 
we have not taken advances against the line of credit since its inception 
the line of credit agreement requires us to comply with various financial and restrictive covenants 
financial covenants include requirements as to tangible net worth  liabilities as a percentage of tangible net worth  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities  required minimum levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and maximum levels of pre tax and after tax losses 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
in july  we commenced construction of an additional building to expand our main genetic center drive campus 
this new building will consist of an approximately  square foot outside shell  with approximately  square feet built out with interior improvements 
the additional space that will not initially be built out will allow for future expansion 
the first phase of this project is currently estimated to cost approximately million  of which million was capitalized to construction in progress during these costs are being capitalized as incurred and depreciation will commence upon our completion and use  which is planned for early these amounts are not included in the chart below 
we have recently implemented a new erp software system which cost approximately million in we expect to incur approximately million of costs in for further improvement to the company s erp system

our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  are for expansion of our genetic center drive campus  continued research and development of new products  costs related to commercialization of blood screening products and purchases of the tigris instrument for placement with our customers 
certain research and development costs are funded under collaboration agreements with partners or agencies of the united states government 
we believe that our available cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises  and available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
however  we operate in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  we may in the future be required to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or from additional credit facilities 
additional capital  if needed  may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  additional debt financing may contain more restrictive covenants than our existing debt 
we may from time to time consider the acquisition of businesses and or technologies complementary to our business 
we could require debt financing if we were to engage in a material acquisition in the future 
in august  we filed a form s shelf registration statement with the sec relating to the possible future sale of up to an aggregate of million of debt or equity securities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest income is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in short term investment grade securities 
a 
table of contents hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk although the majority of our revenue is realized in united states dollars  some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the functional currencies of our majority owned subsidiaries is the british pound 
accordingly  the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the united states dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from transactions denominated in certain foreign countries  but the total receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies at december  were not material 
we believe that our business operations are not exposed to market risk relating to commodity price risk
