some or all of the company s pending and future patent applications may not result in issued patents that provide it with a competitive advantage 
even if issued  such patents  as well as its existing patents  may be challenged and later determined to be invalid or unenforceable 
in addition  others may develop similar or superior products without access to or without infringing upon its intellectual property  including intellectual property that is protected by trade secret and patent rights 
the company cannot be sure that its products or technologies do not infringe patents that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending patent applications or that the company s products do not infringe any patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
occasionally  the company is informed by third parties of alleged patent infringement 
in the event that any relevant claims of third party patents are found to be valid and enforceable  the company may be required to stop selling  incorporating or using its products that use the infringed intellectual property  obtain a license to make  sell or use the relevant technology from the owner of the infringed intellectual property  although  such license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign the company s products so as not to use the infringed intellectual property  which may not be technically or commercially feasible or meet customer requests

overview exar designs  develops and markets high performance  high bandwidth physical interface and access control solutions for use in the worldwide communications infrastructure 
the company s current ic products for the communications market are designed to respond to the growing demand for cost effective line card solutions based on transmission standards such as t e carrier  atm and sonet sdh 
the company designs  develops and markets ic products that address the needs of the serial communications market and also offers a family of clock and timing devices 
in addition  the company designs and markets ic products that address select applications for the video and imaging markets 
exar uses its design methodologies to develop products ranging from assps  designed for industry wide applications  to custom solutions for specific customer applications 
these complementary products enable the company to offer a range of solutions for its customers applications 
exar believes its products offer its customers the following benefits increased bandwidth through the integration of multiple channels on a single device  reduced system noise jitter to improve data integrity  seamless integration  reduced overall system cost and size through the integration of multiple functions on a single device  and accelerated time to market by allowing its customers to focus on core competencies and outsource standards based solutions 
the company s oem customers include  among others  adtran inc adtran  alcatel  cisco systems inc cisco  digi international  inc 
digi international  hewlett packard company hewlett packard  huawei technologies company  ltd 
huawei  logitech international sa logitech  lucent technologies  inc lucent  marconi corporation plc marconi  mitsubishi electronic corporation of japan mitsubishi electronics  nec corporation nec  nokia corporation nokia  plantronics  inc plantronics  siemens ag siemens  and tellabs  inc tellabs 
for the fiscal year ended march   no one oem customer represented or more of net sales 
the company markets its products in north and south america through independent sales representatives and independent  non exclusive distributors  as well as the company s own direct sales organization 
additionally  the company is represented in europe and the asia pacific region by its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  independent sales representatives and independent  non exclusive distributors 
the company s international sales represented  and of net sales for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
these international sales consist primarily of export sales from the united states that are denominated in united states dollars 
such international related operations expenses expose the company to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because the company s foreign operating expenses are denominated in foreign currency while its sales are denominated in united states dollars 
although foreign sales within certain countries or foreign sales comprised of certain products may subject the company to tariffs  the company s profit margin on international sales  adjusted for differences in product mix  is not significantly different from that realized on the company s sales to domestic customers 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of several factors that could materially and adversely affect the company s future profitability  as described below in risk factors 

table of contents fiscal review during fiscal year  the company experienced continued sales growth in its network and transmission market offset by lower sales in the serial communications and substantially lower sales in the video and imaging markets 
the company chose to harvest its historical investment in the video and imaging market by only devoting limited development resources to specific market opportunities 
for fiscal year  sales of its communications products  which encompass network and transmission products and serial communication products  represented of its net sales  as compared to and of its net sales for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
this change in the mix of product sales resulted in improved gross margins as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year which increased to as compared to and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the company believes that increased sales of its communications products are primarily due to the gradual recovery experienced in the telecommunications market and its t e products beginning to move from qualification to production levels 
for fiscal year  net income was million and the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities were million at march  during the year  the company introduced a number of new communications ics  that provide an expanded line of t e carrier products  sonet sdh products  clock distribution devices  as well as a multi channel mhz pci uart 
recent events in order to augment and complement the company s sonet product offerings and strengthen its position at two oem customers  on april   the company entered into a definitive agreement with infineon technologies north america corp 
in which it agreed to acquire for million in cash a significant part of infineon s optical networking on business unit 
the acquisition includes assets relating to the multi rate tdm framer products  fiber channel over sonet sdh  resilient packet ring rpr  as well as certain intellectual property for data over sonet products 
the transaction closed april  outlook for fiscal year the company believes that near term market trends are consistent with gradual improvement in end demand and that inventories at oem customers and distributors are back to normal levels 
therefore  the company believes that it should be able to grow its revenue in line with end demand 
the company anticipates that revenue growth will be driven by increased sales from its network and transmission and serial communications products  initial revenue from its clock products  and sales from its newly acquired sonet products from infineon 
the company expects a modest decline in its video and imaging product line 
the company does however  continue to experience limited visibility with respect to customer demand and ordering patterns for its communications products resulting from shortened order to delivery times and uncertainties associated with future capital expenditures by communications carriers and enterprises 
these net sales expectations are subject to change as customer demand and related customer component inventory levels change 
the company s future results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted as a result of such factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements and accompanying disclosures in conformity with gaap  the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as policies 
table of contents that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company has identified its most critical accounting policies and estimates to be as follows net sales  reserves for excess inventories  income taxes  and non marketable equity securities  which are addressed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies that involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding the company s results
