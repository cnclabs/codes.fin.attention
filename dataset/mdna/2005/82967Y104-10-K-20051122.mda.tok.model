item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a world leader in the global relocation industry  providing our solutions to a well established and diverse customer base  including transferring corporate and government employees and moving individual consumers 
we operate in more than countries under well recognized brand names including sirva  allied  northamerican  global and sirva relocation in north america  pickfords in the united kingdom  maison huet in france  kungsholms in sweden  adam in denmark  majortrans flytteservice in norway  rettenmayer in germany  allied arthur pierre in belgium  france  luxembourg and holland and allied pickfords in the asia pacific region 
we are redefining the global relocation market by combining our relocation service offerings with our proprietary moving services network on a worldwide basis 
this combination is driving our growth by addressing our corporate and government customers needs for a comprehensive service offering with global reach from a single supplier 
in addition  we offer a variety of services targeted at meeting the needs of truck drivers  fleet owners and agents  both inside and outside our proprietary agent network 
the demand for our services is subject to changes in the economy  which can impact our profitability 
since september  we have observed market weakness in the european region  which affects operating results for our moving services europe and asia pacific business segment 
this market weakness is due to a slowdown in overall housing sales  most particularly in the united kingdom 
while not worsening  we expect the sluggish pace of home sales in the united kingdom and difficult market conditions in the european international moving market to continue in the near term 
to address these market challenges  we initiated a restructuring of our european operations in the second quarter of these restructuring initiatives included a reduction in personnel  facilities  equipment and other overhead expenses 
as a result of these initiatives  we expect to incur approximately million of additional restructuring charges in  but then expect to generate ongoing cost savings of approximately million in and thereafter 
in addition  our operating results will be negatively impacted by the cost of professional services related to the independent and internal reviews described below and increased claim accruals and re insurance costs within our insurance operation 
the latter of these was in large part a result of the am best downgrades of our transguard insurance business in april and august of going forward  we do not expect to incur any additional significant expenses relating to the independent and internal reviews 
furthermore  we expect to complete the divestiture of our transguard and other u 
s insurance related businesses in the fourth quarter of during the first half of  we have also observed some signs of weakness in the number of us corporate relocations on a year over year basis 
we are carefully monitoring this and other economic indicators 
however  this softening is mitigated by our global relocation services segment s continued ability to gain new customers and thus increase its revenue despite this recent market weakness 
overall  based on the projected benefits of our european restructuring  the non recurring nature of the expenses incurred during the independent and internal reviews discussed below  the pending sale of our us insurance businesses  and the expectation that we will be able to continue our new customer growth in our global relocation services segment  we expect our overall performance to improve 
our historical development in  clayton  dubilier rice fund v limited partnership organized us to acquire north american van lines  inc from norfolk southern corporation 
as measured by the number of shipments  north american van lines was one of the largest us moving services companies and was a significant provider of specialty transportation services 
in  we acquired the allied and pickfords businesses from nfc plc  now known as exel investments limited 
the integration of this acquisition drove substantial operating synergies as a result of back office rationalization  significant economies of scale and an expanded international service offering 
the allied and pickfords acquisition also brought us additional specialized transportation businesses and transguard  a provider of insurance services to moving agents  fleet owners and owner operator drivers 
we have since completed a number of acquisitions to fill out our global moving footprint 
in june  we acquired maison huet  solidifying our market position in france 
in june  we acquired scanvan  a leading moving services company in scandinavia  operating with the brand names of kungsholms in sweden  adam in denmark and majortrans flytteservice in norway and employing a more asset light model than the rest of europe 
in april  we acquired rettenmayer internationale  a german based moving and relocation business 
the integration of these market leading businesses into a single company has created a proprietary moving services fulfillment network with superior global reach and capabilities 
in the late s  we recognized an increasing trend for corporate customers to outsource all aspects of an employee relocation  including household goods relocation  to relocation service providers 
we viewed this trend as an opportunity to offer our customers higher value services  deepen our customer relationships and move into a complementary and growing market 
consequently  we began a thorough review of the industry for an acquisition candidate that would both meet our requirements for innovative  high quality services and make us a leader in providing comprehensive relocation services to corporate customers 
as a result of this effort  we acquired the relocation services business of cooperative resource services  ltd  or crs  in may crs was a leading independent provider of outsourced relocation services with an innovative and differentiated fixed fee product offering 
later that year  we acquired rowan simmons  a leading independent provider of outsourced relocation services in the united kingdom 
in  we expanded our relocation offerings with the opening of our office in hong kong and the december acquisition of prs europe  a belgium based relocation services provider 
we further enhanced our relocation services offerings in through the acquisition of specialty relocation services provider relocation dynamics  inc rdi in march  the acquisition of the specialty residential brokerage and relocation services business of dj knight in september and the acquisition of executive relocation corporation erc  a us based full service relocation management firm  in december through these acquisitions  and the growth they have generated  we have developed a global relocation services capability that  when combined with our worldwide moving services network  is unique in the industry 
in addition  we also made two acquisitions to help support continued growth in our network services segment 
historically  the primary market for our insurance programs and other services provided to truck drivers  fleet owners and agents was our own network 
with the acquisitions of the national association of independent truckers nait  an association of independent contract truck drivers  in april and the purchase of move pak  a program administrator for a moving and storage insurer  in december  we opened up new customer channels for our network services segment 
in november  we completed an initial public offering of shares of our common stock 
our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol sir 
in june  we completed a secondary public offering of our common stock with shares offered for sale by our three largest stockholders  reducing their ownership from approximately to 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these offered shares 
we incurred million of expenses related to the secondary offering  which were recorded in general and administrative expense 
in conjunction with the secondary offering  one of the selling stockholders fully exercised its warrants 
these were our only outstanding warrants and resulted in proceeds to us of million and the issuance of an additional  common shares 
on september   our board of directors authorized  approved and committed us to a disposal plan involving our north american high value products and homeexpress businesses high value products division  as well as certain other logistics businesses  which include specialized transportation in europe and our transportation solutions segment in north america 
in april  am best downgraded transguard s rating from a u under review to b u under review with negative implications 
in august  the am best rating was further downgraded from b u under review to bu under review 
independent review by audit committee in early january  the audit committee of our board of directors formally initiated a comprehensive  independent review after we received a letter sent on behalf of our former chief financial officer the independent review or review 
at that time  the audit committee engaged the services of cleary gottlieb steen hamilton llp cleary gottlieb  led by former securities and exchange commission sec general counsel david m 
becker  to advise it in connection with the review 
cleary gottlieb retained deloitte touche llp as forensic accountants to assist in the review 
the audit committee instructed cleary gottlieb to exercise its independent judgment on all matters involved in the review 
furthermore  the audit committee directed cleary gottlieb to bring to its attention indications of any improprieties 
the audit committee expanded the scope of its review in february to address certain allegations regarding the adequacy of our accounting practices which were contained in a pseudonymous email sent to pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our independent registered public accountants pwc 
this expanded review closely examined the basis for these allegations  including the relevant company accounting records and related disclosures  and accordingly required additional time to complete 
the audit committee further expanded the scope of its review in march by requesting cleary gottlieb to review the circumstances giving rise to the accounting entries that were the basis for the board of director s decision to restate our previously issued financial statements for the years through and the first nine months of in total  cleary gottlieb reviewed approximately million pages of electronic documents  boxes of physical documents  and interviewed approximately current and former employees  members of senior management and the board of directors 
throughout the course of the audit committee s independent review  pwc was kept informed of the review s progress and interim results 
pwc also was consulted on the scope of the independent review for certain matters and reviewed the conclusions of the independent review 
internal review by management in addition to the independent review  our management conducted an internal review in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
this review was undertaken in connection with implementing procedures to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act  the disappointing performance of our insurance and european businesses in the third quarter of  and as part of our year end closing process 
in january  management substantially expanded its internal review and engaged fti consulting  inc  who have extensive financial experience and expertise in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  to supplement management s efforts 
their combined effort was conducted under the direction of senior financial management with the oversight of the audit committee 
this internal review covered all of our major business units globally  and included a review of our year end balance sheets  as well as a review of numerous transactions  account reconciliations  and other relevant information 
the results of the internal review provided the basis for the board of director s decision to restate the previously issued financial statements for the years through and the first nine months of summary conclusions management s conclusions regarding the findings of both the independent review and its own internal review are summarized in the following paragraphs 
a more detailed summary of clearly gottlieb s findings  conclusions and recommendations to the audit committee is incorporated herein by reference to exhibit of our current report on form k filed with the sec on september  the independent review did not reveal a scheme to misstate our financial statements 
however  both the independent review and the internal review did reveal material weaknesses in our control environment  organizational structure and in our consistent application of gaap 
we are using the conclusions of the reviews as a basis to drive improvements in these areas across each of our business units 
a more detailed discussion of these material weaknesses appears below in item a  controls and procedures 
in addition  the audit committee has been taking appropriate disciplinary actions  including the termination or re assignment of certain employees  and is implementing board level governance changes 
furthermore  the audit committee has adopted the recommendations of the independent review and directed us to implement a remedial action plan 
this plan  among other matters  suggests making significant changes to our organizational structure and to the development  documentation  and delivery of policies and procedures 
the plan also emphasizes and reaffirms our ongoing commitment to training our management team and employees in both technical skills and compliance with corporate governance policies 
financial statement adjustments restatements as discussed above  the audit committee of the board of directors and our management conducted comprehensive reviews of our accounting practices and policies in relation to our previously issued financial statements 
the results of those reviews have prompted us to restate our financial statements for the years ended december  and and the quarters ended march  june and september  and and the quarter ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report for a reconciliation of previously reported amounts to the restated amounts 
the table below reflects errors impacting operating income by segment  as well as the year impacted by the restatement 
we also identified certain corrections that did not affect net income  but did result in correction to the presentation of previously reported balances in the consolidated statements of operations or consolidated balance sheets 
further description of the material adjustments on an individual basis is also included in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
income expense total network services moving services europe and asia pacific moving services north america discontinued operations corporate global relocation services operating income impact net income loss impact earnings per share impact fourth quarter changes in estimates as we conducted our year end closing procedures and our internal review  we identified the need to increase certain accruals  or otherwise record expenses which had not been anticipated at the time we had provided earnings guidance with respect to the fourth quarter of as we became aware of these unanticipated pre tax charges  we disclosed them in press releases dated january   march  and june  we determined that these net unanticipated pre tax charges amount to million  million of which were properly recorded in the fourth quarter of the balance of million represents accounting errors that require restatement of prior quarterly and annual financial statements  million of which relate to continuing operations 
approximately million of the unanticipated pre tax charges  which relate to fourth quarter operating activities or changes in estimates  will be included within reported results for the quarter ended december  a brief explanation of the cause for these charges is summarized below 
material items are also noted  as appropriate  below 
million related to updated information and analysis that indicated the need to further increase the loss reserves in our insurance business 
million of fees associated with the expansion of the securitization facility for our relocation related receivables 
million related to recent developments with respect to certain legal matters 
million write off of a european receivable related to a previous asset sale due to an unanticipated obligor bankruptcy 
million for restructuring and other charges relating to our european operations 
million of corporate charges related to certain severance agreements 
million to impair certain non insurance assets within our network services segment that were divested in the first quarter of  and other miscellaneous items identified through our year end review 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge to write down goodwill associated with our us insurance group 
the impairment was partly due to lower operating results associated with adverse claims development and reinsurance  commission and bad debt expenses identified during our internal year end review 
the lower operating outlook  and consideration of the estimated financial impact of a likely ratings downgrade of our us insurance operations  caused us to perform a critical assessment of the fair value of our us insurance group at december  the analysis revealed that the fair value of the us insurance group was less than its carrying value  causing the impairment write down described above 
operating segments in determining reportable segments  we periodically review several qualitative and quantitative factors associated with our operating segments 
these factors include management reporting  organizational structure  operating revenues  income from continuing operations  assets  customers  services  operating margins and other economic characteristics 
reflecting the increasing importance that the relocation business plays in our overall financial performance  we began in the fourth quarter of to report our results in the following five reportable segments global relocation services  moving services north america  moving services europe and asia pacific  network services and corporate 
moving services europe and moving services asia pacific are separate operating segments 
however  given their similar economic characteristics  services provided  processes  types of customers  methods of service delivery  regulatory environments and meeting certain quantitative thresholds  we concluded these two operating segments should be combined into a single reportable segment  moving services europe and asia pacific 
the table below summarizes the components of our previous reportable segments and our new reportable segments
