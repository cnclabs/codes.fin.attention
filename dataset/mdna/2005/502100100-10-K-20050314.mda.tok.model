item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction this was a year of major changes for the corporation  which serves lorain county  eastern erie county and western cuyahoga county in northern ohio 
the corporation s performance is impacted by general trends in the banking industry and by local economic conditions within the geographic area of the federal reserve bank of cleveland fourth district 
because the corporation derived of its revenues from net interest income in  the economic vitality of this region is an integral factor in the growth of the corporation 
in  our region continued to struggle to recover from recession  and we expect this recovery to continue at a slow pace in during the past year  the board of directors conducted an extensive executive search for a permanent president and ceo to replace the interim president  james f 
kidd 
this search resulted in selecting mr 
daniel e 
klimas as president and ceo of the corporation effective february  the year also reflected the full impact of the sarbanes oxley legislation 
this legislation requires management to develop and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the effectiveness of the corporation s internal controls over financial reporting  and to issue a report on management s assessment 
as with all publicly traded companies  this was a costly and time consuming process 
the previously announced first phase of a restructuring of the branch network was completed in two new offices were opened in avon and avon lake  serving two important growth areas in eastern lorain county 
the corporation also opened a loan production office in westlake  ohio in in  the corporation purchased the assets and assumed certain liabilities of mortgage one banc financial services  inc and is now operating the business as lnb mortgage llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank 
lnb mortgage llc serves as a local mortgage broker that management feels will substantially improve the ability of the corporation to grow mortgage revenue in the future 
the corporation s mission is to meet the demands of the market with unique customer solutions  whether these are free personal checking accounts or multi million dollar commercial loans 
the corporation strives to compete against the super regional banks with superior customer service  and to compete against other community banks by providing more creative and sophisticated products 
key indicators and material trends growth in net interest income continues to be a challenge in the banking industry 
management can effect balance sheet changes that can insulate the net interest margin from dramatic changes in interest rates 
in absolute terms  however  management believes that the corporation will be realizing smaller margins in the future 
since the corporation is dependent on net interest income for a large percentage of its revenue in  minimizing this compression is critical 
the corporation s net interest margin historically has compared favorably with peer banks  and this trend continued in this historical strength is primarily due to the ability to grow and maintain a strong retail deposit base and to grow and maintain a strong commercial lending operation 
the corporation s balance sheet is structured to benefit when rates rise  so as rates began to rise in late  the corporation began to see some net interest margin improvement 
the generation of noninterest income is becoming more critical to the long term success of the corporation 
while the corporation historically has compared quite favorably to peers in this regard  there have been initiatives in the past year to diversify this revenue base 
competitive threats exist to the traditional deposit service charges and other transaction related fees 
additionally  changes in the industry have impacted the corporation s electronic banking fees 
the volume of electronic transactions is growing  but per transaction revenue on debit and atm transactions is declining 
this is the result of visa pricing 
we were also impacted by changes in mastercard standards regarding fee minimums and merchant underwriting standards 
this necessitated a reengineering of our delivery of merchant services to over customers 
this had the impact of reducing our electronic banking revenues and the related costs in the fourth quarter of the profitability of this activity will be approximately the same  but gross merchant revenue will be down approximately million per year 
to address these threats  the corporation has made changes to its investment and trust services and its mortgage banking operations 
additionally  the corporation launched a transaction lending initiative 
in  the corporation plans to continue to further develop its corporate cash management and mortgage businesses 
management believes that asset quality is a key indicator of financial strength  and the corporation continues to manage credit risk aggressively 
in  the level of nonperforming loans decreased over the prior year 
the corporation s risk profile is improving with better loan underwriting  more aggressive management of problem loans and slightly increasing economic conditions 
since the ability to generate deposits is a key indicator of the corporation s ability to meet its liquidity needs and fund profitable asset growth  it is a significant measure of the success of the business plan 
in  as measured by the fdic at june   the corporation s market share of deposits grew slightly  and now stands at 
the corporation continues to do very well generating deposits in its historically strong city markets of lorain  elyria and amherst 
the partial year performance of the new offices in avon lake and avon has exceeded our expectations 
these branch initiatives that were completed in are designed to redeploy resources into the rapidly growing markets in lorain county

return on shareholders equity is a measure of how well the corporation employs leverage to maximize the return on the capital it employs 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
throughout this discussion  net interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis which restates interest on tax exempt securities and loans as if such interest was subject to federal income tax at the statutory rate of 
net interest income is the most significant component of the corporation s revenue  accounting for in  and earnings 
net interest income is affected by changes in the volumes  rates and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets 
table summarizes net interest income and the net interest margin for the three years ended december  table net interest income dollars in thousands net interest income tax equivalent adjustments net interest income fte net interest margin tax equivalent adjustments net interest margin fte the corporation s net interest income was  in  which is a decline of from this follows a decrease in net interest income of in as compared to the net interest margin was in  which is a decline of basis points from this follows a decrease of basis points in as compared to declining net interest income is primarily the result of the continued low interest rate environment through the first nine months of  coupled with the slow recovery of the local economy 
this decline can be seen in table  which segments the change in net interest income into volume and rate components 
the negative impact of rates is much more pronounced in and than the impact of volume 
in and early  the corporation offset some of the net interest margin compression caused by declining rates with balance sheet growth 
however  for much of and into the middle of  assets grew much more slowly than the average asset growth rate in asset growth for did not occur until the latter part of the year  indicating that general economic conditions in the market are slowly improving 
net interest income and the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of were  and as compared to  and for the same period in also impacting the corporation s net interest income was a higher dependence on non core funding sources 
this trend is highlighted in table although these funds are not necessarily more expensive than other funding sources of comparable term  as our funding mix shifts from such extremely low cost sources  like savings accounts  to these alternative funding sources  the potential for further margin compression increases 
in  the corporation attempted to keep asset maturities short and loan volume on a variable rate basis  to be properly positioned for the rising rate environment that began late in the year 
at december   the corporation s cumulative twelve month gap position was a positive million  which means that assets that could potentially reprice in the next twelve months exceeded liabilities by this amount 
consequently  the corporation is positioned to materially benefit from anticipated increases in interest rates as evidenced in the second half of table reflects the detailed components of the corporation s net interest income for each of the three years ended december  rates are computed on a tax equivalent basis and nonaccrual loans are included in the average loan balances

table presents an analysis of increases and decreases in interest income and expense in terms of changes in volume and interest rates during the two years ended december  changes that are not due solely to either a change in volume or a change in rate have been allocated proportionally to both changes due to volume and rate

although these securities are still investment grade  the recent troubles at these two agencies have impacted the value of the equity securities issued by these agencies 
also impacting the value of these securities has been the interest rate environment 
although these securities have variable rate structures  they have long reset periods 
in table  the sources of noninterest income are presented for the three years ended december  to aid in the discussion of core noninterest income trends  totals are presented including and excluding the impairment charge and the gain on sale of the corporation s credit card portfolio 
core noninterest income was  in  an increase of or as compared to as can been seen in table  investment and trust services improved in versus this reflects improved business development efforts  general stock market conditions  and pricing changes in offsetting a portion of this improvement were declines in deposit service charges and electronic banking fees 
the decline in deposit service charges was attributable to local economic conditions 
the decline in electronic banking fees was attributable to changes in the interchange income earned on visa debit card and atm transactions 
the corporation experienced increased card usage in  but these increases were offset by the latest reductions in visa s per transaction pricing 
electronic banking fees were lower in as the corporation made changes to its merchant service processing 
due to changes in mastercard pricing and capital requirements  the corporation outsourced the delivery of merchant processing in the fourth quarter 
this service had generated annual revenue in excess of million in recent years 
however  the profit margin was relatively low  resulting in a pre tax profit of only about per year 
management believes that the changes that would have been required to remain a mastercard merchant processor would have made this service unprofitable 
management expects that this new outsourcing solution will generate approximately the same pre tax income as previously earned before the mastercard changes 
the gain on the sale of loans in was  representing a decrease from in these gains were primarily due to the sale of sba loans 
in  the sale of sba loans was supplemented by the sale of family real estate loans to fhlmc 
the corporation did not sell family loans in the third or fourth quarter of the gain on the sale of securities in was  a decrease of from the gains were primarily from the sale of non rated municipal bonds 
in  the corporation sold its former avon lake office after the new avon lake office opened in the second quarter 
the corporation also sold one of its parking lots in downtown lorain 
the sale of these two assets resulted in a gain on sale of other assets in as compared to in the increase in other income in of  as compared to  was primarily attributable to revenue earned by the corporation s new mortgage company in the last four months of versus noninterest income comparison core noninterest income in was  excluding the sale on the credit card portfolio 
this was a decline of from investment and trust services were  in  a decrease of from which is dependent upon the overall performance of the financial markets 
the decrease was attributable to the weak stock market 
in  deposit service charges were  an increase of over this increase was attributable to the increase in the number of demand deposit accounts 
electronic banking fees were down in  or as compared to the decline was primarily due to the first of several visa pricing changes that reduced the corporation s revenue per atm and debit card transaction 
the gain on the sale of loans was in  an increase of from in gains on the sale of loans resulted from the sale of mortgage loans to fhlmc 
in  the sale of mortgage loans continued  but approximately of the gains on the sale of loans resulted from the sale of sba loans 
in and  the gains on the sale of securities were the result of the corporation s repositioning of its securities portfolio to prepare for the anticipated rising rate environment 
other income was in  a decline of from this decline was due to lower title company and insurance income in table details of noninterest expense for the years ended december  versus versus dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits net occupancy furniture and equipment electronic banking expense supplies and postage outside services marketing and public relations ohio franchise tax other expense total severance expense  nm nm total noninterest expense versus noninterest expense comparison noninterest expense was  in  a decrease of or 
over the prior year 
in noninterest expense included  in severance expenses 
excluding this expense  noninterest expense in would have increased  over the largest increases in noninterest expense in were in salaries and employee benefits  furniture and equipment expense  marketing  and other expenses 
salaries and employee benefits expense was  in  which if severance costs are excluded from the totals  increased over the salary component of this expense was primarily driven by the salaries associated with the lnb mortgage llc addition  which added to salaries in benefit costs were up  or  in versus most benefit costs were well controlled in  however  the corporation did experience a increase in employment services expense related to the ceo and other management searches  and a increase in pension cost related to the minimum pension liability 
furniture and equipment expenses totaled  an increase of as compared to this increase was primarily due to increased software maintenance and amortization related to the upgrade of core systems  the replacement of the mainframe computer and licensing fees resulting from increased users and the necessity to increase servers and server capacity 
the continuing trend in equipment expense stems from a technology upgrade of million that began in and was nearing completion in electronic banking expenses were  in  down from the change in as compared to primarily was the result of the out sourcing of merchant processing 
as discussed in the noninterest income section of this report  this change in processing will reduce card related revenue in future years  but the cost associated with this operation also is reduced 
outside services expense decreased to  in  from  in outside services include general corporate legal expenses  compliance  audit  trust processing  technology consulting and other services 
legal fees decreased in as a result of the corporation s settlement of a complaint brought by the sec 
technology consulting and compliance costs have also returned to more normal levels after increasing in as the corporation updated its technology platform and compliance programs 
management expects that the legal and technology expenses will continue to grow modestly  however  compliance costs and audit fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance are expected to increase 
marketing and public relations expense was  in  an increase of compared to this increase was primarily due to continued marketing costs related to the high performance checking products and marketing expenses in support of the new branch offices opened in also impacting marketing costs were incurred in support of the new mortgage operation 
this expense was primarily attributable to mail and billboard advertising 
versus noninterest expense comparison excluding severance expenses in  core noninterest expense was  nearly unchanged from including severance expenses  noninterest expense was  a increase over salary and employee benefit expense was  in  which excluding the severance expenses in was a decline of  or decrease over this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in pension costs as this plan was frozen as of december   and a reduction in the contribution to the esop plan  partially offset by normal salary increases and higher k expenses 
furniture and equipment costs were  in  an increase of over this increase was due to higher equipment depreciation and software amortization 
electronic banking expense increased in to  versus due to management s decision to outsource the atm and debit card processing  as well as increased transaction volume 
atm and debit card processing was an in house operation in prior years  and this cost was reflected in equipment and software costs in periods prior to outside services were  in  a increase over the increase in reflected legal fees related to a complaint brought by the sec as well as higher than normal compliance fees related to new compliance programs in many areas of the corporation and technology consulting fees related to the technology projects underway in marketing and public relations expense was in  a decrease of compared to the decrease was due primarily to a reduction in marketing costs related to the introduction of the high performance checking products in ohio franchise tax expense was in  an increase of from in the corporation received a refund of ohio franchise tax paid in prior years 
the expense is a more normal level 
the efficiency ratio is expressed as noninterest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income fte plus noninterest income 
the efficiency ratio for increased to from for and for the higher efficiency ratio during and was due to continued revenue compression and the expense trends noted above

on december   nccdc received official notification of this tax credit award 
over the next eleven years  it is expected that projects will be financed  which will improve the overall economic conditions in lorain county  and generate additional net interest income and tax savings for the corporation 
the corporation made a million qualified investment in nccdc in which generated a tax credit in balance sheet analysis securities the maturity distribution of the corporation s securities portfolio for the year ended december  is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the information contained in this note  the mortgage backed securities portfolio has an average life of approximately years  and is expected to generate approximately million of cashflow in the corporation continues to utilize the securities portfolio for management of its interest rate risk and liquidity needs

loans commercial loans comprised of the total loan portfolio at december   increasing from in the growth in the portfolio represents business development efforts in emerging markets 
as mentioned earlier  the corporation s traditional lorain county market has been slow to recover from recession 
however  expanded lending efforts in cuyahoga county provided much of the commercial loan growth in the amount of collateral required on commercial loans generally is determined on a loan by loan basis with loan to value ratios for commercial loans typically ranging from to 
other factors impacting loan to value ratios include the purpose of the loan  the current financial status of the borrower and the prior credit history of the borrower 
installment and home equity loans comprised of the total loan portfolio at december   decreasing slightly from in the corporation makes installment loans on a secured and unsecured basis  based on the term and purpose of the loan 
the corporation also purchases loans from another financial institution in the cleveland area 
real estate loans  including construction and mortgage loans  comprised of the total loan portfolio at december   decreasing from in this decline was the result of two factors 
first  the corporation s mortgage portfolio consists of seasoned adjustable rate mortgages 
with fixed mortgage rates at year lows  this portfolio experienced about a prepayment rate in second  the corporation now generates all mortgage business through lnb mortgage llc 
lnb mortgage llc sells all production  both fixed and variable rates  in the secondary market 
the combination of these two factors has reduced the overall portfolio balances

these loans and their potential loss exposure have been considered in management s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the level of potential problem loans rose significantly during and before stabilizing in the second quarter of this trend was due to local economic conditions and re grading of commercial credits using a new  more formal risk management process 
the economic factors which began as a general weakening of the local economy have started to improve slowly 
the risk management process change was the formation of an independent loan administration function including the recruitment of a loan review officer and adopting a formal loan grading system 
most of the increases in potential problem loans in the last three years were in the category of substandard  with some increase in special mention as defined by regulatory agencies 
at december   potential problem loans totaled  a  or decrease from one year ago 
potential problem loans at december  primarily consist of commercial credits that the bank is monitoring and reviewing 
there are no particular industry concentrations of potential problem loans and the loans are substantially secured by commercial real estate 
prior to  potential problem loans were at relatively low levels 
loan concentrations management is not aware of any loans outstanding which  if aggregated  would be considered a concentration of lending in any particular industry or group of industries  nor are there significant amounts of loans made to agricultural or energy related businesses 
credit risk is managed through the bank s loan loss review policy which requires the loan review officer  lending officers  and the loan review committee to manage loan quality 
the corporation s credit policies are reviewed and modified on an ongoing basis in order to remain suitable for the management of credit risks within the loan portfolio as conditions change 
for the five years ended december   there were no significant concentrations of credit risk in the loan portfolio 
the corporation s operations are limited to three counties in ohio 
it has no foreign loans outstanding and therefore no exposure to cross border lending 
loan quality no material amount of loans that have been classified by regulatory examiners as loss  substandard  doubtful  or special mention have been excluded from the amounts disclosed as nonaccrual  past due days or more  restructured  or potential problem loans 
management is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities which  if implemented  would have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations of the corporation or its subsidiary bank 
provision and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained by the corporation at a level considered by management to be adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio 
the amount of the provision for loan losses charged to operating expenses is the amount necessary  in the estimation of management  to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level 
management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on past experience  changes in portfolio size and mix  relative quality of the loan portfolio and the rate of loan growth  assessments of current and future economic conditions  and information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and collateral values  and other factors  which are subject to change over time 
while management s periodic analysis of the allowance for loan losses may dictate portions of the allowance be allocated to specific problem loans  the entire amount is available for any loan charge offs that may occur

nonperforming loans are loans which are days past due  and in management s estimation  collection of interest is doubtful 
these loans no longer accrue interest and are accounted for on a cash basis 
loans are classified as restructured when  due to deterioration of a customer s financial ability  the original terms have been favorably modified or either principal or interest has been forgiven

the corporation also generates funds through wholesale sources that include local borrowings generated by our business sweep accounts 
the corporation also has begun to access the brokered cd market providing term funding at rates comparable to other national market borrowings 
national market borrowings are lines of credit with correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  and the federal reserve bank of cleveland

the corporation expects these trends to continue 
liquidity management of liquidity is a continual process in the banking industry 
the liquidity of the bank reflects its ability to meet loan demand  the possible outflow of deposits and to take advantage of market opportunities made possible by potential rate environments 
assuring adequate liquidity is achieved by managing the cashflow characteristics of the assets the bank originates and the availability of alternative funding sources 
the bank monitors liquidity according to limits established in the liquidity policy 
the policy establishes minimums for the ratio of cash and cash equivalents to total assets and the loan to deposit ratio 
at december  the bank was in compliance with these policy limits 
in addition to maintaining a stable source of core deposits  the bank manages adequate liquidity by assuring continual cashflow in the securities portfolio

critical accounting policy and estimates the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
it follows general practices within the banking industry and application of these principles requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the corporation are presented in item  note these policies are fundamental to the understanding of results of operation and financial conditions 
the accounting policies considered to be critical by management are as follows allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  taking into consideration such factors as past loss experience  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that affect the borrower s ability to pay 
determination of the allowance is subjective in nature 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that not all principal and interest amounts will be collected according to the loan contract 
residential mortgage  installment and other consumer loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
individual commercial loans exceeding size thresholds established by management are evaluated for impairment 
impaired loans are recorded at the loan s fair value by the establishment of a specific allowance where necessary 
the fair value of all loans currently evaluated for impairment are collateral dependent and therefore the fair value is determined by the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the corporation maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is comprised of a general allowance  a specific allowance for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance representing estimations done pursuant to either standard of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  or sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the general allowance is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans 
for commercial and commercial real estate loans  loss factors are applied based on internal risk grades of these loans 
many factors are considered when these grades are assigned to individual loans such as current and past delinquency  financial statements of the borrower  current net realizable value of collateral and the general economic environment and specific economic trends affecting the portfolio 
for residential real estate  consumer and other loans  loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis 
loss factors are based on the corporation s historical loss experience and are reviewed for appropriateness on a quarterly basis  along with other factors affecting the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
specific allowances are established for all classified loans when management has determined that  due to identified significant conditions  it is probable that a loss has been incurred that exceeds the general allowance loss factor for those loans 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the estimation risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances and incorporates management s evaluation of existing conditions that are not included in the allocated allowance determinations 
these conditions are reviewed quarterly by management and include general economic conditions  credit quality trends and internal loan review and regulatory examination findings 
management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
however  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations pension accounting four key variables are used for calculating the annual pension cost size of employee population  actuarial assumptions  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate 
described below is the effect of each of the variables on the pension expense size of employee population has stayed more or less stagnant over the last few years  thereby causing pension cost relating to this variable to be more or less the same 
actuarial assumptions are required for mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate and the rate of compensation increases 
these factors do not change over time  so the range of assumptions and their impact on pension expense is generally narrow 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets are based on the balance in the pension asset portfolio at the beginning of the plan year and the expected long term rate of return on that portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return is designed to approximate the actual long term rate of return on plan assets over time 
the expected long term rate of return is generally held constant so the pattern of income expense recognition more closely matches the stable pattern of services provided by the employees over the life of pension obligation 
at december  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was 
a discount rate is used to determine the present value of the future benefit obligations 
it reflects the rates available on long term high quality fixed income debt instruments  reset annually on the measurement date 
the discount rate used in was 
income taxes the corporation s income tax expense and related current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as prescribed in sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
sfas requires the periodic review and adjustment of tax assets and liabilities based on many assumptions 
these assumptions include predictions as to the corporation s future profitability  as well as potential changes in tax laws that could impact the deductibility of certain income and expense items 
since financial results could be significantly different than these estimates  future adjustments may be necessary to tax expense and related balance sheet accounts 
impacts of recent accounting pronouncements management is not aware of any proposed regulations or current recommendations by the financial accounting standards board or by regulatory authorities  which  if implemented  would have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources  or operations of the corporation 
however  the potential impact of certain accounting and regulatory pronouncements warrant further discussion 
sfas no 
revised share based payment in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised december  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb opinion sfas r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of the grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
in addition  companies must recognize compensation expense related to any stock based awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provision of sfas no 
the corporation anticipates adopting sfas r prospectively in the first quarter of the proforma information provided previously under stock based compensation provides a reasonable estimate of the projected impact of adopting sfas r on the corporation s results of operations 
aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer in december  the aicpa s accounting standard executive committee issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  sop 
sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
the provisions of this sop are effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the corporation does not expect the requirements of sop to have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
eitf no the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments in march  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force in issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
generally  an impairment is considered other than temporary unless the investor has the ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment  and evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
if impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss should be recognized through earnings equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting requirements of eitf until additional implementation guidance is issued and goes into effect 
the corporation does not expect the requirements of eitf to have a material impact on the corporation s results of operations  financial position or liquidity
