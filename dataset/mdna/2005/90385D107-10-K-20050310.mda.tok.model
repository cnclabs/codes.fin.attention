executive summary ultimate software s ultipro workforce management software ultipro is a web based solution designed to deliver the functionality businesses need to manage the employee life cycle  from recruiting and hiring to compensating and managing benefits to terminating  whether their processes are centralized at headquarters or distributed across multiple divisions or branch offices 
the company s main sources of revenues include sales from the intersourcing offering defined below  sales of perpetual software licenses for ultipro and the related annual maintenance and sales of services mostly implementation related to both intersourcing and license sales 
in the past  the company s primary business strategy was centered on sales of perpetual software licenses of ultipro 
in an effort to reduce the volatility and unpredictable nature of a business strategy predominantly focused on license sales  the company introduced intersourcing as an additional revenue source during in  ultimate software began offering hosting services  branded intersourcing by the company  whereby ultimate software provides the hardware  infrastructure  ongoing maintenance and back up services for its customers at a bellsouth data center managed by ibm 
intersourcing is designed to appeal to those customers that want to minimize their internal technology support requirements for the application and hardware 
after the introduction of intersourcing in mid  the sales mix gradually began to shift towards intersourcing  especially during and continuing in management believes the shift in sales mix helps to produce a more predictable revenue stream by providing recurring revenue and cash from intersourcing over the related contract periods  typically months 
as intersourcing units are sold  the recurring revenue backlog associated with intersourcing grows  enhancing the predictability of future revenue streams 
for the last six months of  the sales mix for number of units sold began shifting to favor intersourcing units over license units  with this shift continuing into during the year ended december   the sales mix for new units sold was comprised of approximately intersourcing units and license units  which reflected a higher concentration of new intersourcing units sold compared to the same period of  when the sales mix for new units sold was comprised of intersourcing units and license units 
the company expects the sales mix composition to continue to favor intersourcing during the financial impact of the shift from sales of license units to a combination of sales of license units and intersourcing units relates to the type of revenue recognized and the timing of recognition  the amount of services revenue recognized  and the timing of cash received from the sale 

table of contents when an intersourcing unit is sold instead of a license unit  license revenue is replaced with recurring revenue 
the license revenue which would otherwise have been recognized upfront assuming all required accounting criteria are met is replaced with recurring revenue recognized over the contract term typically months with such recurring revenue recognition commencing when the customer runs its first live payroll ie  generally between four and six months from the date of sale 
the total revenue from the sale of an average intersourcing unit sold is usually no less than it would have been if it were a license sale  with the main difference pertaining to the period of recognition ie  being spread over a period of time rather than upfront 
in addition to the change in type of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition  implementation revenue a component of services revenue is also impacted by the shift in sales mix to intersourcing 
on average  an intersourcing unit takes less time to implement than a license unit 
therefore  as the sales mix shifts towards intersourcing  billable hours for the company s implementation services per unit typically decrease 
cash is also impacted when an intersourcing unit is sold instead of a license unit 
for a typical license unit sale  the cash due for the license and the first year of annual maintenance is received within months from the contract date 
however  when an intersourcing unit is sold  the cash due from the intersourcing sale is received over the course of the contract term  typically months 
the total cash received from the sale of an average intersourcing unit sold is usually no less than it would have been if it were a license sale with the main difference pertaining to the period of time in which it is received 
while making the transition from a business model focused solely on sales of perpetual licenses to a business model that includes both license sales and intersourcing sales  the company raised additional capital in and to address expected cash needs related to the transition 
in may  capital from a private placement of the company s common stock  par value per share the common stock  totaling million  net of stock issuance costs  was raised to provide cash to fund future operations based on the company s anticipated growth in intersourcing sales 
in  capital from private placements of the company s common stock  totaling million  net of stock issuance costs  was raised to fund operations including the impact of the transition toward more sales of intersourcing units and to provide cash to fund future operations based on the company s anticipated growth in intersourcing sales 
as a result of the company s recent transition to a sales mix favoring intersourcing units  a key financial metric used by the company in measuring future financial performance is new annual recurring revenues 
new annual recurring revenues represent the expected one year value from i new intersourcing sales from the company s hosted model including prorated one time charges  ii maintenance revenues related to new license sales  iii recurring revenues from new business service providers  and iv recurring revenues from additional sales to ultimate software s existing client base 
new annual recurring revenues attributable to sales during were million as compared to million for another major component of recurring revenues is subscription revenues generated from the company s business service provider bsp channel 
the bsp contributing the most revenues from the bsp channel during each of  and was ceridian corporation ceridian under the original ceridian agreement defined below

as previously disclosed  ultimate software and ceridian signed an agreement in  as amended  granting ceridian a non exclusive license to use ultipro software as part of an on line offering for ceridian to market primarily to businesses with less than employees the original ceridian agreement 
ceridian marketed that solution under the name sourceweb 
during december  rsm mcgladrey employer services rsm an existing business service provider of ultimate software s  acquired ceridian s sourceweb hr payroll and self service product and existing sourceweb base of small and midsize business customers throughout the united states the rsm acquisition 
the financial terms of the original ceridian agreement have not changed as a result of the rsm acquisition 
ceridian will continue to be financially obligated to pay ultimate software a minimum fee of  per month with increases of per annum  compounded beginning in january the aggregate minimum payments that ceridian is obligated to pay ultimate software under the original ceridian agreement over the minimum term of the agreement 
table of contents are million 
to date  ceridian has paid to ultimate software a total of million under the original ceridian agreement 
ultimate software expects to continue to recognize a minimum of  per month in recurring subscription revenues from the original ceridian agreement until its termination 
the earliest date that this agreement can be terminated by either party is march  except for an uncured material breach 
the amount of subscription revenue  a component of recurring revenues  recognized under the original ceridian agreement in  totaling million  was the same as that recognized in during and  ultimate software entered into services agreements  as amended and extended from time to time  individually  the ceridian services agreement and collectively  the ceridian services agreements  with ceridian 
under the ceridian services agreements  ceridian was obligated to pay ultimate software a total of million and million in and  respectively  payable in equal quarterly installments  in exchange for additional services provided by ultimate software during the term of the agreements 
the ceridian services agreement expired effective december  and was recognized on a straight line basis from february  through december  the ceridian services agreement  as extended from time to time during  expired on december  and was recognized on a straight line basis from january  through december  the company offers and provides certain services to other bsps 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition sources of revenue for the company include sales of perpetual licenses for ultipro  sales of perpetual licenses for ultipro in conjunction with services to host the ultipro application hosting services  sales of the right to use ultipro through intersourcing the intersourcing offering  which includes hosting services  sales of hosting services on a stand alone basis to customers who already own a perpetual license or are simultaneously acquiring a perpetual license for ultipro base hosting  sales of services including implementation  training and other services  including the provision of payroll related forms and the printing of form w s for certain customers  as well as services provided to bsps  including ceridian through december  pursuant to the ceridian services agreements  and recurring revenues derived from maintenance revenues generated from maintaining  supporting and providing periodic updates for the company s software and subscription revenues generated from per employee per month pepm fees earned through the intersourcing offering  base hosting and the bsp sales channel  as well as revenues generated from the original ceridian agreement 
perpetual licenses for ultipro sold with or without hosting services sales of perpetual licenses for ultipro and sales of perpetual licenses for ultipro in conjunction with hosting services are multiple element arrangements that involve the sale of software and consequently fall under the guidance of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  for revenue recognition 

table of contents the company licenses software under non cancelable license agreements and provides services including maintenance  training and implementation consulting services 
in accordance with the provisions of sop  license revenues are generally recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed by both parties  the product has been shipped  no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
to the extent any one of these four criteria is not satisfied  license revenue is deferred and not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations until all such criteria are met 
for multiple element software arrangements  each element of the arrangement is analyzed and the company allocates a portion of the total fee under the arrangement to the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the element vsoe  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
fair value is considered the price a customer would be required to pay when the element is sold separately 
the residual method as defined below is used to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based on the historical evidence of stand alone sales of these elements to third parties 
undelivered elements in a license arrangement typically include maintenance  training and implementation services the standard undelivered elements 
the fair value for maintenance fees is based on the price of the services sold separately  which is determined by the annual renewal rate historically and consistently charged to customers the maintenance valuation 
maintenance fees are generally priced as a percentage of the related license fee 
the fair value for training services is based on standard pricing ie  rate per training day charged to customers for class attendance  taking into consideration stand alone sales of training services through year end seminars and historically consistent pricing for such services the training valuation 
the fair value for implementation services is based on standard pricing ie  rate per hour charged to customers for implementation services  taking into consideration stand alone sales of implementation services through special projects and historically consistent pricing for such services the implementation valuation 
under the residual method the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee attributable to the delivered element  the license fee  is recognized as revenue 
if vsoe for one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred on the entire arrangement until the earlier of the point at which i such vsoe does exist or ii all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
perpetual licenses of ultipro sold without hosting services typically include a license fee and the standard undelivered elements 
fair value for the standard undelivered elements is based on the maintenance valuation  the training valuation and the implementation valuation 
the delivered element of the arrangement  the license fee  is accounted for in accordance with the residual method 
perpetual licenses of ultipro sold with hosting services typically include a license fee  the standard undelivered elements and hosting services 
fair value for the standard undelivered elements is based on the maintenance valuation  the training valuation and the implementation valuation 
hosting services are delivered to customers on a pepm basis over the term of the related customer contract hosting pepm services 
upfront fees charged to customers represent fees for the hosting infrastructure  including hardware costs  third party license fees and other upfront costs incurred by the company in relation to providing such services hosting upfront fees 
hosting pepm services and hosting upfront fees collectively  hosting services represent undelivered elements in the arrangement since their delivery is over the course of the related contract term 
the fair value for hosting services is based on standard pricing ie  rate charged per employee per month  taking into consideration stand alone sales of hosting services through the sale of such services to existing customers ie  those who already own the ultipro perpetual license at the time hosting services are sold to them and historically consistent pricing for such services the hosting valuation 
the delivered element of the arrangement  the license fee  is accounted for in accordance with the residual method 
the company s customer contracts are non cancelable agreements 
the company does not provide for rights of return or price protection on its software 
the company provides a limited warranty that its software 
table of contents will perform in accordance with user manuals for varying periods  which are generally less than one year from the contract date 
the company s customer contracts generally do not include conditions of acceptance 
however  if conditions of acceptance are included in a contract or uncertainty exists about customer acceptance of the software  license revenue is deferred until acceptance occurs 
sales generated from the intersourcing offering subscription revenues generated from the intersourcing offering are recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as a services arrangement since the customer is purchasing the right to use ultipro rather than licensing the software on a perpetual basis 
fair value of multiple elements in intersourcing arrangements is assigned to each element based on the guidance provided by eitf the elements that typically exist in intersourcing arrangements include hosting services  the right to use ultipro  maintenance of ultipro ie  product enhancements and customer support and professional services ie  implementation services and training in the use of ultipro 
the pricing for hosting services  the right to use ultipro and maintenance of ultipro is bundled the bundled elements 
since these three bundled elements are components of recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of operations  allocation of fair values to each of the three elements is not necessary and they are not reported separately 
fair value for the bundled elements  as a whole  is based upon evidence provided by the company s pricing for intersourcing arrangements sold separately 
the bundled elements are provided on an ongoing basis and represent undelivered elements under eitf  they are recognized on a monthly basis as the services are performed  once the customer has begun to process payrolls used to pay its employees ie  goes live 
implementation and training services the professional services provided for intersourcing arrangements are priced on a time and materials basis and are recognized as services revenue in the consolidated statements of operations as the services are performed 
under eitf  fair value is assigned to service elements in the arrangement based on their relative fair values  using the prices established when the services are sold on a stand alone basis 
fair value for professional services is based on the respective training valuation and implementation valuation 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
the company believes that applying eitf to intersourcing arrangements as opposed to applying sop is appropriate given the nature of the arrangements whereby the customer has no right to the ultipro license 
sales of base hosting services subscription revenues generated from base hosting are recognized in accordance with eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software that stored on another entity s hardware  which provides guidance as to the application of sop to hosting arrangements that include a license right to the software 
the elements that typically exist for base hosting arrangements include hosting services and implementation services 
base hosting is different than intersourcing arrangements in that the customer already owns a perpetual license or is purchasing a perpetual license for ultipro and is purchasing hosting services subsequently in a separate transaction whereas  with intersourcing  the customer is purchasing the right to use not license ultipro 
implementation services provided for base hosting arrangements are substantially less than those provided for intersourcing arrangements since ultipro is already implemented in base hosting arrangements and only needs to be transitioned to a hosted environment 
fair value for hosting services is based on the hosting valuation 
the fair value for implementation services is based on standard pricing ie  rate per hour charged to customers for implementation services  taking into consideration stand alone sales of implementation services through special projects and historically consistent pricing for such services the implementation valuation 
fair value for implementation services is assigned in accordance with guidelines provided by sop based on the implementation valuation 

table of contents services  including implementation and training services services revenues include revenues from fees charged for the implementation of the company s software products and training of customers in the use of such products  fees for other services  including those related to the ceridian services agreements through december   the provision of payroll related forms and the printing of form w s for certain customers  as well as certain reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
revenues for training and implementation consulting services are recognized as services are performed 
other services are recognized as the product is shipped or as the services are rendered depending on the specific terms of the arrangement 
arrangement fees related to fixed fee implementation services contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method  which involves the use of estimates 
percentage of completion is measured at each reporting date based on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete 
if a sufficient basis to measure the progress towards completion does not exist  revenue is recognized when the project is completed or when we receive final acceptance from the customer 
recurring revenues recurring revenues include maintenance revenues and subscription revenues 
maintenance revenues are derived from maintaining  supporting and providing periodic updates for the company s software 
subscription revenues are principally derived from pepm fees earned through the intersourcing offering  base hosting and the bsp sales channel  as well as revenues generated from the original ceridian agreement 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the service period  generally one year 
maintenance and support fees are generally priced as a percentage of the initial license fee for the underlying products 
to the extent there are upfront fees associated with the intersourcing offering  base hosting or the bsp sales channel  subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related contract upon the delivery of the product and services 
in the cases of intersourcing and base hosting sales  amortization of the upfront fees commences when the customer processes its first live payroll  which typically occurs four to six months after the sale  and extends until the end of the contract period 
in the case of bsp channel sales  amortization of the upfront fee typically commences when the contract is signed  which is when the bsp s rights under the agreement begin  continuing until the contract term ends 
pepm fees from the intersourcing offering  base hosting and the bsp sales channel are recognized as subscription revenue as the services are delivered 
commencing on august   subscription revenues generated from the original ceridian agreement are recognized ratably over the minimum term of the contract  which is expected to extend until march  years from the effective date of the original ceridian agreement

quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in the years ended december  and in management s opinion  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented 
this information should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k 
the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  increased expenses especially as they 
table of contents relate to product development and sales and marketing  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of revenues  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors and capital spending patterns of the company s customers 
the company establishes its expenditure levels based upon its expectations as to future revenues  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
a drop in near term demand for the company s products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
operating results achieved in previous fiscal quarters are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full fiscal years or for any future periods 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish or  when established  maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
the company believes that  due to the underlying factors for quarterly fluctuations  period to period comparisons of its operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
