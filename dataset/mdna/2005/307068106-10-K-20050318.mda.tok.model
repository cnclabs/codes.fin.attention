recognition of franchise related revenue initial franchise revenue is recognized when we have performed substantially all of our obligations as franchisor 
franchise royalties are recognized when earned as promulgated by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for franchise fee revenue 
franchise related revenue consists of royalty revenue and franchise fees  which include initial franchise fees and area development fees 
our franchise revenues are comprised of area development fees  initial franchise fees  and continuing royalty payments 
our area development fee consists of a non refundable payment equal to  per unit upon the signing of the area development agreement 
since the fee is non refundable to secure the territory  we recognize this fee upon receipt 
our initial franchise fee is typically  per restaurant  of which  is recognized immediately when a franchise agreement is signed  reflecting the commission earned and expenses incurred  as related to the sale of the franchise 
when the franchise agreement is signed  since our primary obligation relates to site selection  the remaining  is carried in deferred franchise fees and is recognized as revenue when the lease has been signed or the purchasing closing document has been obtained and  at which time we have substantially performed all of our services 
franchisees are also required to pay us a continuing royalty equal to a percentage of their weekly net sales  which has historically varied from to 
currently  new franchises pay us a continuing royalty of of their net sales 
franchise related revenue for fiscal was approximately million  a increase compared to franchise related revenue of approximately million for the same period in  primarily reflecting increased royalties 
royalties  which are based on a percent of franchise operated restaurant net sales  increased  reflecting the annualization of franchise restaurants that opened in fiscal in addition to the franchise operated restaurants that opened during fiscal during  franchised operated restaurants opened  and closed 
there were franchise operated restaurants open at january   compared to at december  additionally  during fiscal  we realized higher royalties from three company owned restaurants sold to a franchise partner in the fourth quarter of fiscal an additional franchise restaurants are anticipated to open throughout fiscal asset impairment and restructuring charges in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate restaurant sites and long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of restaurant sites to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the restaurant site to its fair value  as determined by the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
any impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the restaurant site exceeds its fair value using a discounted cash flow method 
restaurant sites that are operating but have been previously impaired  are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
our january  consolidated balance sheet reflects approximately million of assets held for sale  
table of contents which includes the land and building for our mesquite  tx location that was closed in december we had several offers for this location during  and believe the land and building are properly valued 
during fiscal  there were no impairment or restructuring charges recorded 
in fiscal  we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of approximately million related to five units  two of which were subsequently closed  two of which were subsequently sold to franchisees  and one that was fully impaired  but still operating 
deferred tax asset deferred taxes recognize the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded for financial statement purposes and such amounts measured in accordance with tax laws 
realization of net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax temporary differences are contingent on future taxable earnings 
during fiscal  our deferred tax asset was reviewed for expected utilization using a more likely than not approach as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by assessing the available positive and negative evidence surrounding its recoverability 
we believe that the realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not based on the fact that the company generated taxable income in fiscal and based on the expectation that our company will generate the necessary taxable income in future years 
lease accounting in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for leases  we recognize lease expense for our operating leases over the entire lease term including lease renewal options and build out periods where the renewal is certain and the build out period takes place prior to the restaurant opening or lease commencement date 
we account for construction allowances by recording a receivable when its collectibility is considered certain  depreciating the leasehold improvements over the lesser of their useful lives or the full term of the lease  including renewal options and build out periods  amortizing the construction allowance as a credit to rent expense over the full term of the lease  including renewal options and build out periods  and relieving the receivable once the cash is obtained from the landlord for the construction allowance

our franchise related revenue is comprised of area development fees  initial franchise fees  and continuing royalty payments

the remaining  is recognized upon either the signing of a lease or upon receipt of a builder s permit  and at which time we have substantially performed all of our services

costs and expenses restaurant costs and expenses include food and beverage costs  operating payroll and employee benefits  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance costs  supplies  advertising and promotion  and restaurant depreciation and amortization 
certain of these costs and expenses are variable and will increase or decrease with sales volume 
the primary fixed costs are corporate and restaurant management salaries and occupancy costs 
our experience is that when a new restaurant opens  it incurs higher than normal levels of labor and food costs until operations stabilize  usually during the first three months of operation 
as restaurant management and staff gain experience following a restaurant s 
table of contents opening  labor scheduling  food cost management and operating expense control are improved to levels similar to those at our more established restaurants

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year total revenue total revenue of approximately million for fiscal increased approximately million or over revenue of approximately million for fiscal fiscal consisted of weeks as compared to weeks for fiscal revenue for the rd week in fiscal was approximately million  including restaurant sales and franchise royalties 
restaurant sales restaurant sales decreased by approximately million or to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year the decrease in sales was due primarily to the sale of three georgia restaurants to a franchisee and the closure of two texas restaurants that generated approximately million in restaurant sales in fiscal without these restaurants in the base  sales would have been higher in compared to the decrease in sales for  related to these five restaurants  was partially offset by approximately million in sales attributed to the rd week 
franchise related revenue franchise related revenue consists of royalty revenue and franchise fees  which include initial franchise fees and area development fees 
franchise related revenue for fiscal was approximately million  a increase when compared to franchise related revenue of approximately million for the same period in  primarily reflecting increased royalties 
royalties  which are based on a percent of franchise operated restaurants net sales  increased reflecting the annualization of franchise restaurants that opened in fiscal in addition to the net new franchise restaurants during fiscal there were franchise operated restaurants open at january   compared to at december  licensing and other revenue licensing revenue includes royalties from a retail line of business  including sauces  and seasonings 
other revenue includes opening assistance and training we provide to our franchise partners 
for fiscal year  the licensing royalty income was approximately  compared to approximately  for fiscal year during fiscal  we expect to see licensing revenue remain relatively flat 
the amount of other revenue is expected to grow based on the level of opening assistance we may be required to provide during the franchise openings planned for same store net sales it is our policy to include in our same store net sales base  restaurants that are open year round and have been open for at least months 
at the end of fiscal  there were restaurants included in this base 
same store net sales for fiscal increased approximately  compared to fiscal s decrease of approximately and were calculated assuming fiscal was a week year 
we believe that the increase in same store net sales reflects the combination of our advertising initiatives  the success of our limited time offerings  a price increase of approximately and a focus on operational excellence and execution in our restaurant 
average weekly net sales weighted average weekly net sales for our company owned and franchise operated restaurants during fiscal were  and  respectively 
during fiscal  weighted average weekly net sales for our company owned and franchise operated restaurants were  and  respectively 
the favorable trend in average weekly sales for both company owned and franchise operated restaurants reflects the success of our total brand building effort 
food and beverage costs food and beverage costs for fiscal were approximately million or of net restaurant sales compared to approximately million or of net restaurant sales for fiscal the increase is primarily the result of higher commodity costs  partially offset by the menu price increase implemented at the beginning of the third quarter 
approximately of our purchases are on contract and overall  contracts negotiated for have resulted in less favorable pricing 
our pork contract renewal resulted in an contracted price increase  our poultry contract  
table of contents resulted in an price increase and our brisket contract resulted in a increase 
our brisket contract renews in july and we are watching the beef market closely 
we anticipate that food costs  as a percent of net restaurant sales  will remain relatively flat as increases due to contract pricing increases are offset with margin opportunities 
we believe that we have an opportunity to mitigate the impact that the recently renewed food contracts have on our margin through menu engineering such as with the use of our limited time offerings  which typically have higher margin  and leveraging adult beverage sales  which are currently at approximately of our dine in sales 
additionally  we will evaluate taking a price increase as appropriate 
labor and benefits labor and benefits at the restaurant level were approximately million or of net restaurant sales in fiscal compared to approximately million or of net restaurant sales in fiscal the decrease in labor and benefits reflects favorable workers compensation claims experience and labor productivity  partially off set by a higher level of bonus payout at the restaurant level 
full service restaurants that operate in states without a tip credit such as minnesota experience a higher wage rate for dining room labor than do restaurants located in states where a tip credit is available to reduce wages paid to food servers 
the migration toward full service dining in the majority of our restaurants is part of our strategy for increasing unit level revenue  but may result in higher labor costs 
during fiscal  we are expecting labor and benefits as a percentage of net restaurant sales to remain relatively flat to fiscal operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal were approximately million or of net restaurant sales  compared to approximately million or of net restaurant sales for fiscal the decrease in operating expenses reflects the reduction in company owned restaurants compared to in addition  repair and maintenance costs for fiscal year were million compared to million for fiscal  reflecting a significant investment in the prior year toward neglected restaurants 
during fiscal  operating expenses as a percentage of net restaurant sales are expected to decrease from the percentage in fiscal  primarily due to lower levels of repairs and maintenance costs and further leveraging of fixed costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for fiscal was approximately million  or of total revenue  compared to approximately million  or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily reflects fewer company owned restaurants in during fiscal  depreciation and amortization is expected to remain relatively flat to fiscal levels as depreciation from asset additions are offset by assets that will be fully depreciated during fiscal asset impairment and restructuring charges during fiscal  we recorded no asset impairment and restructuring charges compared to the recording of approximately million of charges on five locations in as of january   we had approximately million of assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet representing the land and building on one of the restaurants in texas for which an impairment was recorded and the restaurant was subsequently closed

it also includes increased payroll as 
table of contents we continue to build our infrastructure 
during  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase approximately basis points as a percentage of total revenue  as a result of the increased cost of the performance share program  adoption of sfas no 
r in the third quarter of fiscal and also as a result of the services we expect to provide to the expected franchise operated openings 
interest expense income interest expense  net  totaled approximately million or of total revenue for fiscal compared to approximately million or of total revenue for fiscal this line item represents interest expense from capital lease obligations  notes payable and financing lease obligations partially offset by interest income received on short term cash and cash equivalents balances 
the decrease in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of no capitalization of construction costs  due to no restaurant openings 
we are expecting interest expense to increase moderately from fiscal levels due to the newly available million line of credit obtained in early  which carries a variable rate as well as a non use fee  and the increased amortization of deferred financing costs related to this line 
other expense income  net other expense  net of approximately  primarily reflects the write off of a restaurant s remaining assets subsequent to the sale to a franchise 
this compares to  in for losses related to expenses on an unopened site and early extinguishments of debt associated with the early payoff of a note  partially offset by gains attributable to the sale of three units in georgia to a franchisee 
equity in loss from unconsolidated affiliate until february   we were a participant in a joint venture to operate themed restaurant concepts based on the entertainment artist isaac hayes 
pursuant to an agreement governing the joint venture  the participants in the joint venture formed a delaware limited liability company named fumume  llc
