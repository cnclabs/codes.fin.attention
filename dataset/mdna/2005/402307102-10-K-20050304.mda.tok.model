item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction and outlook the company s results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of exploration and development activity maintained by oil and gas exploration and production companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  foreign locations throughout the world  ii the company s ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii the company s ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and gas prices  and changes in technology that reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment  especially in subsalt geological formations which generally are located in to feet of water and in deepwater to  feet areas of the gulf of mexico 
the distraction caused by continued consolidation activity by the oil and gas exploration and production companies and generally unfavorable trends in exploration and development activity  have caused corresponding low levels of oil and gas development activity 
development in the gulf of mexico in water depths greater than feet  where larger structures requiring more steel tonnage are needed  began declining in and has remained low throughout the low activity levels had a negative effect on the demand for the available capacity of the major platform fabricators serving the gulf of mexico  which caused reduced pricing levels for their services through the end of the dollar value of projects available in the gulf of mexico market is significantly below those levels of five to six years ago 
competition for available projects remains intense and near term  future margins will likely remain uncertain 
recognizing the slowdown in the gulf of mexico activity levels  the company stepped up its marketing efforts in the international arena 
as a result of these efforts  of the company s backlog at december  relates to contracts for an international destination 
cost reduction measures are also continuously reviewed to address these conditions 
demand for the company s services will continue to depend 
table of contents largely upon actual or anticipated prices for oil and gas  which are difficult to predict 
at some point  however  it is expected that demand for the company s products and services should recover as oil and gas reserves are reduced and the company s customers are forced to replace them 
during  the company s workforce decreased slightly to approximately  at december  demand for the company s products and services dictates the company s workforce needs 
although the company generally tries to minimize the use of contract labor  it will do so when required to meet customer demand 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours actually performed to date compared to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  the company would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
profit incentives from customers are included in revenue when their realization is reasonably assured 
claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenue when the amount can be reliably estimated and collection is probable 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined 
receivables in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes adequate provisions for probable doubtful accounts 
during  the company recorded a net recovery of previously impaired accounts receivable of  decreasing the allowance for doubtful accounts to approximately in november  gulf island  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of gulf island fabrication  inc  filed a breach of contract suit against j 
ray mcdermott for non payment of a portion of a contract completed by gulf island  llc earlier in the amount of the unpaid portion of the contract in contracts receivable  net is approximately million 
j 
ray mcdermott has deposited certified funds with the terrebonne parish clerk of court in the amount of of the unpaid portion
