item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we provide scheduled ground transportation of cargo on a time definite basis 
as a result of our established transportation schedule and network of terminals  our operating cost structure includes significant fixed costs 
our ability to improve our operating margins will depend on  among other things  our ability to increase the volume of freight moving through our network

results of operations the following table shows the percentage relationship of expense items to operating revenue for the periods indicated 
in the accompanying discussion  all percentage figures are as a percent of operating revenue with the exception of revenue growth rates 
year ended december operating revenue operating expenses purchased transportation salaries  wages and employee benefits operating leases depreciation and amortization insurance and claims other operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations interest expense other income  net total other income income before income taxes income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million in airport to airport  which is the largest component of our operating revenue  increased million to million  accounting for of our total operating revenue 
during  we experienced a increase in tonnage that transited our network as the result of a stronger economy and positive trends among our customer base 
our airport to airport business is priced on a per pound basis and the average revenue per pound including the impact of fuel surcharges increased for versus primarily as the result of a rate increase implemented during the year 
our logistics revenue  which is primarily truckload brokerage and priced on a per mile basis  increased million to million in during the year  we increased the number of miles driven to support our logistics revenue by while increasing the revenue per mile including the impact of fuel surcharges charged by 
accessorial revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling and accounts for our final component of operating revenue  increased million to million  a increase from purchased transportation decreased to of operating revenue in versus in the same period of the decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily attributed to a year over year improvement in tonnage transported through the airport to airport network and revenue per pound that allowed us to operate our network more efficiently in versus during the year  we increased the amount we spent for purchased transportation by million  an increase of 
for  purchased transportation costs for our airport to airport network represented of airport to airport revenue versus in during this period  we were able to increase both the volume and revenue per pound of freight  which enabled us to operate the airport to airport network more efficiently 
these increases were offset  in part  by an increase in the number of miles needed to operate our system as well as an increase in the average rate per mile paid 
for  logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus last year 
we also increased the amount paid during for cartage or the local pick up and delivery of freight by to million 
salaries  wages and employee benefits were of operating revenue in compared to for the same period of the decrease in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily attributed to a year over year improvement in tonnage and revenue per pound that allowed us to operate our network more efficiently in versus the amounts spent on salaries and wages  including incentives and health care costs increased and during  respectively 
these increases  however  were offset by a decrease in the amount we spent on workers compensations expenses 
this decrease resulted from favorable settlement of prior period claims  as well as better current year claims experience 
operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of operating revenue in compared to in the same period of the decrease in operating leases as a percentage of operating revenue between periods was primarily attributable to an increase in operating revenue as the dollar amount in this category decreased slightly between the two periods 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was in compared to in the same period of the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in operating revenue and a decrease in depreciation expense from certain assets becoming fully depreciated  including two non compete agreements which were fully amortized as of december  these decreases were offset  in part  by new depreciation from capital expenditures during insurance and claims were of operating revenue in compared to in the same period of the net increase in insurance and claims was approximately  primarily as the result of a decrease in our loss development factor as we have had  in general  better insurance claims experience over the last few insurance periods 
this decrease  however  was offset by increases in claims amount during the period which were driven primarily by an adverse loss development on one major accident 
we are self insured for each auto liability claim in the amount of  other operating expenses were relatively flat in  accounting for of operating revenue compared to in the same period of other operating expenses include repair and maintenance  license and taxes  driver recruiting and compliance and other miscellaneous expenses 
income from operations increased by million  or  to million for compared with million for the same period in the increase in income from operations was primarily a result of the increase in operating revenue  including fuel surcharges  which was offset in part by increases in variable costs associated with operating the network 
interest expense was  or less than of operating revenue  in compared with  or less than  for the same period in other income  net was million  or of operating revenue  in compared to million  or  for the same period in the increase in other income  net resulted from higher interest income attributed to higher yields on higher balances in available for sale securities during the combined federal and state effective tax rate for was of pre tax income compared to a rate of for the same period in as a result of the foregoing factors  net income increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the same period in year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million in this increase resulted from an increase in traditional linehaul revenue of million to million  an increase in logistics revenue of million to million and an increase in other accessorial revenue of million to million 
traditional linehaul revenue was impacted during the year by an increase in average weekly tonnage of 
we experienced the additional benefit of a increase in average revenue per pound  including the effect of fuel surcharge  versus purchased transportation represented of operating revenue in compared to in the decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily the result of an increase in operating revenue combined with a higher utilization of the airport to airport network 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in logistics revenue  where purchased transportation costs are traditionally higher as a percent of operating revenue than traditional linehaul purchased transportation costs 
for  traditional linehaul and logistics purchased transportation costs represented and  respectively  of operating revenue  versus and  respectively  during salaries  wages and employee benefits were of operating revenue in compared to for the increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was attributed to a increase in workers compensation expense compared to last year 
while we spent a higher dollar amount on wages and benefits during  the increase in operating revenue offset that amount so that the figure essentially remained flat as a percentage of operating revenue 
operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of operating revenue in compared to in during  we undertook leases for additional space in several markets of strategic importance which increased the dollar amount of operating leases 
the amount of operating revenue we generated during  however  offset the amount of additional rent expense and kept the amount as a percent of operating revenue constant when compared to depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was in  compared to in during  certain of our assets became fully depreciated causing both the dollar amount spent and the percent of operating revenue to decline from to insurance and claims were of operating revenue in  compared with in the increase in insurance and claims as a percentage of operating revenue resulted primarily from a increase in insurance premiums which was caused by a favorable premium adjustment under a retroactive premium insurance policy during the fourth quarter of claims experience during remained flat when compared to both in terms of dollar amount and as a percent of operating revenue 
other operating expenses were of operating revenue in compared to in during  our miscellaneous expenses  including bad debt expense  decreased by of operating revenue from additionally  the amounts paid for other taxes and licenses and fuel decreased by and  respectively  of operating revenue from income from operations increased by million  or  to million for compared with million for the increase in income from operations was primarily a result of the increase in operating revenue  including fuel surcharge  which was offset by an increase in operating costs associated with operating the network 
interest expense was million  or less than one tenth of one percent of operating revenue  in  compared to million  or  for the decrease in interest expense was the result of the early retirement of debt related to our facility in columbus  ohio in december other income  net was million  or of operating revenue  in  compared to million  or  for other income  net during consisted primarily of interest income generated by our short term investments 
while we had a larger amount of available for sale securities in  we experienced a lower rate of return on those amounts 
other income during included a million settlement paid to us by us xpress enterprises  inc  a million gain on the condemnation of a facility we owned in atlanta and a million charge from the early retirement of debt related to our facility in columbus  ohio 
the combined federal and state effective tax rate for was compared to a rate of for as a result of the foregoing factors  net income increased by million  or  to million for  from million in discussion of critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example  bankruptcy filings  accounts turned over for collection or litigation  we record a specific reserve for these bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for these bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
specifically  amounts that are days or more past due are reserved at 
if circumstances change ie  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
accounts are written off after all means of collection  including legal action  have been exhausted 
allowance for revenue adjustments our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise i when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  ii when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  iii when billing errors occur  and iv when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
we monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised and that fraud does not occur 
during  average revenue adjustments per month were approximately  on average revenue per month of approximately million less than of monthly revenue 
in order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable  we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying these revenue adjustments 
based on this analysis  we establish an allowance for approximately days dependent upon experience in the last twelve months of average revenue adjustments  adjusted for rebates and billing errors 
the lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience 
additionally  the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted 
both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity 
self insurance loss reserves given the nature of our operating environment  we are subject to vehicle and general liabililty  workers compensation and health insurance claims 
to mitigate a portion of these risks  we maintain insurance for individual vehicle and general liability claims exceeding  and workers compensation claims and health insurance claims exceeding  the amount of self insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process for self insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends  management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year s estimation process referred to as a hindsight analysis and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis 
additionally  beginning in  we utilize an actuary to evaluate open vehicle liability claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our working capital needs  including capital purchases  with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million for compared with million in net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for compared with net cash used in investing activities of million in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of available for sale securities  operating equipment and information systems  and the proceeds from the sales or maturities of available for sale securities during included in cash provided by investing activities was approximately million held in escrow as of december  related to the atlanta condemnation described in item of this form k 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million for compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million in financing activities included the repayment of long term debt and capital leases  proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and repurchases of our common stock 
we expect net capital expenditures in for operating equipment and management information systems to be approximately million 
we intend to fund these expenditures through cash currently on our balance sheet  cash provided by operating activities or borrowings under our credit facility  if necessary 
the capital expenditure budget does not include any allocation for acquisitions 
our credit facility consists of a working capital line of credit 
as long as we comply with the financial covenants and ratios  the credit facility permits us to borrow up to million less the amount of any outstanding letters of credit 
interest rates for advances under the facility vary based on how our performance measures against covenants related to total indebtedness  cash flows  results of operations and other ratios 
the facility bears interest at libor plus to and is unsecured 
the facility s expiration was extended until april by letter agreement entered into in at december   we had million of available borrowing capacity under the line of credit facility and had utilized million of availability for outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants and ratios under the credit facility 
on july   we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to  shares of our common stock 
we expect to fund the repurchases of our common stock from our cash  available for sale securities and cash generated from operating activities 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock for million for an average purchase price of per share 
this includes  shares that were purchased in december  but not paid for until representing approximately million in accounts payable at year end 
on february   our board of directors declared a three for two stock split of our common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend to shareholders of record as of march  common stock issued and additional paid in capital have been restated to reflect the split for all years presented 
all common share and per share data included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been restated to give effect to the stock split 
prior to february   we had never declared a cash dividend  our policy being to reinvest earnings into our business while retaining adequate cash reserves to fund potential acquisitions 
on february   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share of our common stock on a three for two stock split adjusted basis 
we expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends  though each subsequent quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had letters of credit outstanding from a bank totaling million required by our workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance providers 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands are summarized below contractual obligations payment due period total less than year years years after years capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations at december   we had no outstanding purchase commitments 
we believe that our available cash  available for sale securities  cash expected to be generated from future operations and available borrowings under lines of credit  will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
related party transactions transactions with landair transport  inc scott m 
niswonger  the chairman of the board  owns a majority interest in the parent company of landair transport  inc landair 
we purchase truckload transportation services from landair 
matthew j 
jewell  our senior vice president and general counsel  served in these same capacities with landair until may disclosures regarding amounts charged to landair and amounts charged by landair to us for various operational and administrative services are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we purchased million  million and million of truckload transportation services from landair in  and  respectively  which have been included in purchased transportation in the consolidated statements of income 
transactions with sky night  llc we purchase air transportation services from sky night  llc sky night  a limited liability corporation owned by scott m 
niswonger  the chairman of the board 
air charter expense totaled   and  in  and  respectively  and has been included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
during  we entered into an agreement to sublease hangar space at our greeneville  tennessee headquarters to sky night 
the initial term of the sublease was for months and the monthly rental rate was determined based on market prices for similar spaces in the area 
the sublease term has been extended through july impact of recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an option 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in a period in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
r on july  the company at this time plans to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified retrospective method  restating all prior periods 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such tax deductions is disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  sets forth criteria under which a company must consolidate certain variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
places increased emphasis on controlling financial interests when determining if a company should consolidate a variable interest entity 
we adopted the provisions of interpretation no 
during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the fasb deferring the effective date of fasb interpretation no 
for variable interests held by public companies 
the adoption of interpretation no 
had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements  as defined in section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
forward looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and relate to future events or our future financial performance 
some forward looking statements may be identified by use of such terms as believes  anticipates  intends  plans  estimates  projects or expects 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the following is a list of factors  among others  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements economic factors such as recessions  inflation  higher interest rates and downturns in customer business cycles  our inability to maintain our historical growth rate because of a decreased volume of freight moving through our network or decreased average revenue per pound of freight moving through our network  increasing competition and pricing pressure  surplus inventories  loss of a major customer  the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to pay for services rendered  our ability to secure terminal facilities in desirable locations at reasonable rates  the inability of our information systems to handle an increased volume of freight moving through our network  changes in fuel prices  claims for property damage  personal injuries or workers compensation  employment matters including rising health care costs  enforcement of and changes in governmental regulations  environmental and tax matters  the handling of hazardous materials  the availability and compensation of qualified independent owner operators and freight handlers needed to serve our transportation needs and our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions 
as a result of the foregoing  no assurance can be given as to future financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk except for capital lease obligations totaling million  we had no long term debt at december  accordingly  our exposure to market risk related to remaining outstanding debt is not significant 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates from our available for sale securities 
as a result of the regularly reset interest rates to market rates on the available for sale securities we own  a material adverse effect to the fair market value of the investments is unlikely
