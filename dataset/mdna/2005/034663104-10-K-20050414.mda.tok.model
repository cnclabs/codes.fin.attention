item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview angelica is a leading provider of outsourced linen management services to the healthcare industry in the united states 
we offer comprehensive linen management services to the us healthcare industry  including hospitals  long term care facilities  surgery centers  medical clinics  dental offices  and other medical providers 
among the items that we clean and provide  on either a rental or customer owned basis  are bed linens  towels  gowns  scrubs  surgical linens and surgical packs  as well as mops  mats and other dust control products 
to a more limited extent  we also provide linen management services to customers in the hospitality business 
currently  we operate laundry facilities and serve customers in states 
we were founded in and subsequently expanded into three operating divisions uniform manufacturing  uniform retail  and linen management services 
in fiscal  we sold our uniform manufacturing business 
in fiscal  we sold our uniform retail business and decided to focus our remaining linen management services business on the healthcare industry 
in fiscal  healthcare linen services represented approximately of our revenues  with of revenues from other linen service markets 
we expect healthcare linen management services to increase as a percentage of total revenues 
except as otherwise noted  the following discussion relates only to our continuing linen management operations and excludes our previously discontinued operations 
although our fiscal year has not changed  we changed the terminology describing our fiscal year in february we now  and retroactively  refer to the fiscal year by the calendar year in which the first months of the fiscal year fall 
fiscal year started on february  and ended on january   fiscal year started on january  and ended on january   and fiscal year started on january  and ended on january  our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in january and the fiscal year usually contains weeks  but occasionally contains weeks 
fiscal contained weeks with a week fourth quarter 
fiscal had weeks  with its fourth quarter being comprised of weeks 
revenues are recognized when the clean linens are delivered to the customer 
our textile service revenue has grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  or over the four year period 
most of our growth has been achieved organically by developing existing customers and adding new customers although we began adding to this growth with acquisitions in fiscal going forward  we expect to grow by virtue of acquisition of regional and local competitors and to supplement this with approximately annual organic growth 
our acquisition program is focused on healthcare laundry services currently owned either by hospitals or competitors 
since we seek to concentrate our plants in clusters enabling us to better service our customers and providing us with economies of scale  we primarily look for opportunities within or around our existing markets 
although we may expand geographically via acquisition  this will most likely be on the fringes of existing service areas 
for example  since beginning this strategy eighteen months ago  we have completed ten acquisitions  eight of which have been in existing markets with the remaining two being adjacent to existing markets 
we expect these acquisitions to significantly add to our existing revenues and earnings 
in evaluating acquisition opportunities  we consider strategic value  projected ebitda  impact on earnings per share  return on net assets and internal rate of return 
the ten acquisitions over the last eighteen months are shown in the chart below 
in aggregate  we paid million for these ten acquisitions 
all acquisitions were financed from available credit facilities and cash flow from operations 
the following depicts the acquisitions we have completed during the past months 
date acquired company description of acquisition goodwill other intangibles recorded march royal institutional services  inc and its affiliate  the surgi pack corporation purchased the stock of the companies and accompanying healthcare linen services business in somerville and worcester  ma tbd january national service industries d b a national linen services purchased laundry facilities and linen services business in dallas and wichita falls  tx m january tartan textile services purchased healthcare linen services business and assumed lease for laundry facility in hempstead  ny m december united linen services d b a golden states services purchased healthcare linen services business and assumed leases for laundry facilities in sacramento and turlock  ca m may tartan textile services purchased healthcare linen services contracts from tartan s portland  me laundry facility m april duke university health system purchased laundry in durham  nc and signed a long term supply agreement with duke healthcare facilities m april on premise laundries purchased inventory and equipment and assumed healthcare linen services contracts at two on premise laundries located at hospitals in tx and ga m december national service industries purchased laundry facility and healthcare linen services business in safety harbor  fl m november tenney laundry services purchased healthcare linen service contracts and selected assets in batavia  ny m this acquisition was completed on march  and as such  we are in the process of completing the purchase price allocation analysis 
during fiscal  we recorded million in goodwill acquired in transactions completed during fiscal versus million acquired in fiscal we expect this amount will increase over time as a result of our recent acquisitions of royal institutional services  inc  and its affiliate  the surgi pack corporation  and any subsequent acquisition we make as part of our acquisition strategy 
annual goodwill impairment testing is performed at the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year using a fair value based analysis 
costs of textile services are recognized and recorded as incurred 
over the last five years  our cost of textile services has gone from in fiscal to in fiscal as a percent of revenue 
during this period  however  costs of textile services have ranged from a low of in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal  primarily due to the volatility of energy costs 
the major components of our cost of textile services are direct and indirect production labor and fringe benefit costs  which represented of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal linen depreciation  which represented of revenues in fiscal  versus of revenues in fiscal delivery expenses  which represented of revenues in fiscal versus in fiscal this includes delivery fuel expense which was of revenues in fiscal compared with in fiscal  and utilities  which represented of revenues in fiscal versus in fiscal this includes natural gas which was of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal over the next three years  we plan to reduce costs of textile services by improving linen and natural gas procurement  testing and implementing new delivery planning and routing  and making capital investment in our facilities to increase labor productivity and reduce energy utilization 
we also intend to expand our clustering strategy of having a number of facilities in a local market  which we believe creates opportunities to improve operating efficiencies in many cost areas  including distribution  as well as to enhance the level of service we can provide to our customers 
we have begun testing route maximization software and other technologies to minimize inefficient delivery routes 
in addition  we have instituted a standardization process for purchasing linens and changed our energy hedging policy to an operational model from an economic model allowing us to take advantage of longer term buying opportunities for natural gas in the future 
finally  we are planning to invest approximately million per year during the next three years for capital improvements  the vast majority of which will be invested in our plants in order to improve productivity and decrease energy usage 
gross profit is the difference between revenues and cost of textile services  and gross margin is the relationship of cost of textile services expressed as a percentage of revenues 
over the past four years  our gross profit has grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during this period  gross margin has ranged from to of revenues 
our goal of reaching a gross margin in three years will be impacted by a number of factors  including our ability to obtain price increases equal to the inflationary pressures we experience 
while our customer contracts often have inflation pricing escalator clauses based on various consumer price indexes  or cpi  the aggregate annual price increases are usually capped and the costs listed above affect us to a greater degree than the cpi as they comprise a much larger part of our cost structure 
in addition  mounting pressure on our healthcare customers to contain costs has somewhat curtailed our ability to negotiate price increases in line with inflation 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by future energy availability or costs  but we believe our energy hedging policy will allow us to take advantage of any pricing opportunities in the energy market in the future 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include all other operating expenses not included in cost of textile services  including those related to sales and marketing  human resources  accounting  information systems  and other administrative functions not allocable to individual customers 
these expenses are expensed as incurred 
with the sale of our manufacturing business in fiscal and retail business in fiscal  we have streamlined our corporate offices from people at the end of fiscal to people at the end of fiscal in fiscal  sg a was million  representing of revenues compared with million  or of revenues in fiscal of the fiscal sg a  million was attributable to our plants and million was attributable to our atlanta and st 
louis corporate offices 
we expect sg a to continue to decline as a percent of revenue as we continue to grow our business organically and through acquisition and the fixed components of these costs are spread over a larger revenue base 
our information systems upgrade which will continue through could increase sg a in absolute dollars  but during this period should not have any substantial impact on sg a as a percent of revenue 
other operating income or expense includes amortization of intangibles such as non compete agreements and customer contracts acquired  offset by any non recurring gains or losses 
this may vary significantly year to year due to acquisitions and divestitures of assets 
in fiscal  the sale of our daytona beach  florida hospitality accounts generated million of income and we recorded an additional million as a gain on an insurance settlement that more than offset the million of intangible amortization 
going forward  we may opportunistically dispose of non healthcare assets which no longer fit in our strategic plans  and we expect to incur significantly more amortization expense reflecting our acquisition program 
interest expense is recorded as incurred and includes amortization of any loan fees over the life of the loan 
the sale of our manufacturing business in fiscal dramatically reduced our overall debt levels since proceeds from the sale were used to pay off existing debt 
in fiscal  interest expense was million 
going forward  we expect interest expense to rise significantly as we have used debt to finance our acquisitions 
non operating income is recognized as realized and reflects sales of non operating properties  life insurance proceeds  interest on the million note received by us from the buyer as part of the consideration from the sale of the retail business and other non operating items 
for fiscal  non operating income included the sale of real estate owned by us in miami  florida  death benefits received on company owned life insurance policies and securities received in a bankruptcy settlement of a receivable from a former business unit 
our tax rate reflects statutory tax rates reduced by federal and state tax credits and non taxable income including the cash value gains on life insurance policies held 
in addition  when there might be an alternative tax interpretation other than the one we used  we recognize this possibility via tax reserves 
in fiscal  following the completion of audits in the united states and canada  we recognized a million reversal of these reserves 
in addition  cash taxes paid may differ significantly from recorded expense due to net operating loss nol carryforwards and changes in deferred tax items 
in fiscal we recorded a federal nol of million primarily attributable to the sale of our retail division 
in addition  we have various other state tax nols and state and federal tax credits 
since we believe all deferred tax items will be realized  we have not recorded any valuation allowances 
we do not anticipate recording net operating losses regularly in the future 
critical accounting policies and judgments in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on a continuing basis  including those related to self insurance liabilities  stock based compensation  bad debts  linens in service  property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  discontinued operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we discuss below the more significant accounting policies  estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
by their nature  these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating amounts to record in the consolidated financial statements 
linens in service linens in service represent the unamortized cost of textile and linen products purchased for service to customers 
linens in service are amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives of one to two years 
specific physical identification and inventory of linens in service is impractical in our business due to the fact that the inventory is circulating between our facilities and our customers facilities  however  industry data available supports the reasonableness of these expected useful lives 
furthermore  the consistent application of these lives has produced historical levels of linens in service that are comparable as a percent of textile service rental revenues 
management believes the expected useful lives are appropriate for the valuation of linens in service 
self insurance liabilities we self insure liabilities for non union employee medical coverage and liabilities for casualty insurance claims  including workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability  up to certain levels 
we purchase insurance coverage for large claims over the self insured retention levels 
in fiscal  we sold all casualty claims occurring prior to february  to an insurance company 
we maintain the liability for casualty claims that have occurred since february  and these amounts are set forth on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  self insurance liabilities are estimated using actuarial methods and historical data for payment patterns  cost trends and other relevant factors 
while we believe that the estimated liabilities recorded for casualty and employee medical claims as of january  are adequate  and that appropriate judgment has been applied in determining the estimates  such estimated liabilities could differ materially from actual liabilities resulting from the ultimate disposition of the claims 
income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
balances in the deferred income tax accounts are regularly reviewed for adequacy and recoverability by analyzing the expected income necessary to realize the deferred assets  the anticipated tax rates applicable when the deferred items are expected to be recognized and the ability to utilize carryforward items 
at january   we reported an aggregate of  in federal net operating loss carryforward and various state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we do not provide for deferred tax liabilities related to the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance policies under the assumption that these policies will be held by us until death of the insured 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  we believe certain positions could be challenged by tax authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance or a partial adjustment 
significant judgment is required in the evaluation of our reserves 
our reserves are regularly reviewed for adequacy and adjusted based on changing circumstances and the progress of tax audits 
in fiscal we recognized a million adjustment in these reserves which resulted in a reduction in our tax expense 
we believe that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods presented  and all net deferred tax assets will be fully recovered 
stock based compensation we currently apply apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for the issuance of stock options to employees and directors 
under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  companies are encouraged but not required to adopt a fair value based method to recognize compensation expense of equity instruments awarded to employees 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we will be required to recognize compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements for the fair value of stock option awards on the grant date over the required service or vesting period 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r on our net income in future periods will include the remaining amortization of the fair value of existing unamortized stock options in the amount of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
any new grants of stock options will increase the amount of amortization expense by the fair value of the newly granted options on the date of grant and this amount will be amortized over the vesting period of these new options 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 we consider the possible impairment of our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
indications of possible impairment include  but are not limited to  operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
to determine the potential impairment of long lived assets  we are required to make estimates of the projected future cash flows associated with the use of the assets  as well as their fair values 
we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets as of january  are fully recoverable 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill recorded as of june  was no longer amortized effective in fiscal instead  goodwill is tested for impairment using a fair value based analysis at least annually as of the end of the third quarter 
discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal  we announced our decision to exit and discontinue our retail business segment and actively market the segment for sale 
we completed the sale of our retail business to healthcare uniform company  inc  an affiliate of sun capital partners  inc  at the end of the second quarter 
the segment s financial position  cash flows and results of operations are shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report 
our continuing operations reflect the results of our remaining textile services healthcare laundry and linen management business 
recent developments during march  we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock and warrants of royal institutional services and  its affiliate  the surgi pack corporation for cash consideration 
in connection with this transaction a portion of the purchase price was paid into an escrow account as of the closing of the transaction pending the resolution of certain contingencies set forth in the stock purchase agreement 
these contingencies include the attainment of an agreed upon level of performance of certain newly installed equipment  the renewal or assignment of specified customer contracts and the compliance of specified individuals with an agreement not to compete with the acquired business in its current market area for a period of time after the closing 
our consolidated balance sheet will include the financial condition of royal institutional and surgi pack as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal and our income statement and statement of cash flows for the first quarter of fiscal will include the results of operations of royal institutional and surgi pack from march   the date of the acquisition 
results of continuing operations fiscal year ended dollars in thousands january  january  january  revenue   cost of services   gross profit   selling  general and administrative expense  other operating income expense income from operations   interest expense  non operating income   loss on early extinguishment of debt income before income taxes  income taxes   net income   analysis of fiscal continuing operations compared to textile service revenues of million in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal acquisitions during fiscal contributed million of the revenue increase  offset in part by the loss of million of revenues due to the sale of non healthcare customer accounts from our daytona beach  florida facility in the second quarter of fiscal fiscal benefited from a full year of revenue from acquisitions completed in fiscal  which accounted for another million of the revenue increase in fiscal after adjusting fiscal revenues downward by approximately million for the extra week in the fiscal year  organic growth in revenue was million  or percent  due to an average price increase  plus a volume increase 
consistent with our strategic plan to concentrate marketing and acquisition efforts on customers in the healthcare industry  healthcare revenues increased in fiscal to million 
non healthcare revenues decreased from fiscal  primarily due to the sale of the non healthcare accounts in daytona beach 
as an integral part of our long term strategy  we anticipate a continued decline in non healthcare revenues as a percent of total revenues in future periods 
cost of textile services of million in fiscal increased million or from fiscal after adjusting for the increase in volume  utilities increased million in fiscal due primarily to higher natural gas costs  and delivery fuel increased by million compared with fiscal direct labor expense increased million due to higher wage rates  and production fringe benefit cost  including workers compensation  increased million year over year 
competitive pressures in the marketplace limited our ability to offset these cost increases through higher customer pricing  as average prices on contract renewals declined slightly year to year 
in addition  annual cpi price increases on many existing contracts were not reflective of our underlying cost increases since the cpi indexes used in those contracts do not weight utilities costs and workers compensation and healthcare insurance expense in the same manner as these items are weighted in our actual cost of services 
due to the aforementioned factors  gross margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses of million decreased million or in fiscal to of revenues from in fiscal reductions in these expenses were primarily comprised of million  or of fiscal expenses  due to the downsizing of the corporate office and staff and million  or of fiscal expenses  due to lower bonus amounts accrued 
bad debt expenses were negligible in fiscal these reductions were somewhat offset by million of additional professional fees incurred in connection with our response to a corporate campaign by union activists who sought to disrupt our business operations in order to pressure us into recognizing the union in our non unionized facilities 
other operating income of million in fiscal benefited from the net gain of million on the sale of the daytona beach non healthcare accounts and a gain of million on the settlement of a property insurance claim 
offsetting these fiscal operating income gains was increased amortization expense of million in fiscal  reflecting the impact of intangible assets acquired in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  in fiscal we reported other operating expense in fiscal of million reflecting amortization of intangible assets of million and miscellaneous income of million 
we expect a more significant increase in amortization expense in fiscal due to the full year impact of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the month impact of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the royal transaction in march interest expense in fiscal was million  an increase of million or over the million of interest expense incurred in fiscal the increase in interest expense reflects the increase in indebtedness due to the acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in fiscal at january   we had million in total debt outstanding under a revolving loan agreement with a bank credit facility 
on march   we borrowed the entire amount of the million term loan included in the facility 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to fund the acquisition of royal institutional services and surgi pack and reduce the amount outstanding on the revolving loan agreement 
of the amount of debt outstanding on january   million bore interest at a fixed rate of pursuant to an interest rate swap agreement plus the margin under the credit facility 
the libor margin as of january   was under the credit facility 
the remaining debt of million bore interest at  the prime rate as of january  on february   we entered into libor contracts for million and million which currently bear interest at plus the margin and plus the margin  respectively 
on april  we entered into a libor contract on the million outstanding under the term loan which bears interest at the rate of plus the margin 
we anticipate that interest expense will increase in fiscal with the full year of interest paid on the debt incurred in connection with the fourth quarter fiscal acquisitions and the first quarter fiscal acquisition of royal institutional services and surgi pack as well as the general upward trend in interest rates 
in fiscal  we recorded non operating income of million due primarily to gains of million from the sale of real estate we owned in miami  florida from a facility that was closed in fiscal  million from death benefits on company owned life insurance policies  and million received in a bankruptcy settlement of a receivable related to a former business 
we recorded non operating income of million in fiscal  resulting mainly from a million cash payment received in conjunction with the demutualization of a life insurance company that had issued policies owned by us 
our provision for income taxes for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  from the million of income taxes recorded in fiscal lower income tax expense in fiscal as compared with the prior year was primarily due to lower pretax income and a tax contingency adjustment 
based on the completion of tax audits in the united states and canada  we reevaluated our tax reserves and adjusted our tax liability accordingly 
net income from continuing operations declined million  or  in fiscal lower operating income and an increase of million in interest expense due to higher debt levels in fiscal more than offset the million increase in non operating income and the lower provision for income taxes for the year 
analysis of fiscal continuing operations compared to textile service revenues of million in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal revenues from our existing facilities contributed million of the increase  million of which was due to the extra week 
the remaining million of the increase was due to fiscal acquisitions 
in december  we acquired a healthcare linen services facility and business located in tampa  florida with annual revenues of approximately million  and in early fourth quarter  we acquired customer contracts and selected assets of a linen services business in batavia  new york with annual revenues of approximately million 
cost of textile services of million in fiscal increased million  or from fiscal the majority of this increase was due to higher revenues and significant increases in utilities and delivery fuel costs 
utilities increased million and delivery fuel increased million compared with fiscal after adjusting for the volume increase 
due to the above described factors  gross margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses of million increased million  or  in fiscal due primarily to costs related to our search for  and transition to  a new chief executive officer  but declined as a percent of revenues  from in fiscal to in fiscal fiscal other operating expense of million reflected intangible amortization of million partial offset by million other miscellaneous income 
the reduction in interest expense of million or in fiscal reflects the lower debt level and lower interest rates following the sale of our manufacturing division and subsequent refinancing of our debt in the second quarter of fiscal fiscal non operating income of million consisted primarily of a million cash payment received in connection with the demutualization of a life insurance company that had issued policies owned by us 
as discussed in note  we incurred a million pretax loss on early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of a prepayment penalty paid to lenders in connection with the refinancing of our debt 
the loss was originally shown as an extraordinary item  net of tax  in fiscal however  under a new accounting pronouncement adopted in fiscal  the loss is treated as an ordinary rather than extraordinary item  and accordingly  fiscal results of continuing operations were restated in fiscal to reflect this change in accounting treatment 
our provision for income taxes for fiscal was million  a million increase over the million provided in fiscal income taxes were provided for at an effective tax rate of in fiscal and in fiscal the lower tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to the effect of the aforementioned loss on early extinguishment of debt 
net income from continuing operations increased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the loss on the early extinguishment of our credit facility of million and a million higher interest expense in fiscal more than offset the higher operating income and lower provision for income taxes for the fiscal year compared with fiscal financial condition as of january   working capital totaled million as compared with million in working capital at the end of fiscal  excluding assets and liabilities of discontinued segment 
the current ratio ie  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at the end of fiscal and to at fiscal year end 
the decline in our working capital and current ratio is due to the various installment payments and holdbacks negotiated in the acquisitions during fiscal which are primarily being recorded as other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  receivables and linens in service increased million and million  respectively  in fiscal due to businesses acquired during the year and the increase in operating revenues 
accounts receivable days outstanding of at january  was unchanged from the end of fiscal increases in total property and equipment of million and goodwill and other acquired assets of million reflect mainly the cost of businesses acquired in fiscal other long term assets include the value of the note receivable in the principal amount of million from the sale of our retail business which we carried at a discounted value of million as of january  although we believe the discounted note is fairly valued  this note is not readily marketable and is subordinate to other outstanding debt of the issuer 
ultimately  the value of the note is dependent upon the success of the buyer in operating the purchased business 
the increase in other accrued liabilities of million in fiscal is due primarily to installment payments and holdbacks of a portion of the purchase price for certain business acquisitions during the year 
the installment payments will be paid to the sellers upon the scheduled payment date and the holdbacks will be paid to the sellers based primarily upon the renewal or retention of the customer contracts purchased in the acquisitions during designated periods after the closing date of the particular transaction 
long term debt of million as of january  was million higher than a year ago  reflecting the financing of the business acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal our ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of january  was  up from as of january  book value per share increased to at the end of fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operating activities of continuing operations decreased million or in fiscal  due in part to the increase in receivables discussed above 
additionally  in fiscal we received a federal income tax refund of million due mainly to the loss on the sale of our former manufacturing segment recorded in prior fiscal years 
cash flows from investing activities reflect the cash paid for businesses and assets acquired in fiscal  which were funded from borrowings against our long term revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  we received proceeds of million from the sale of non healthcare customer accounts and million from the sale of real estate owned by us in miami  florida  as well as death benefits on company owned life insurance policies totaling million 
capital expenditures decreased million in fiscal from the level in fiscal due to the inclusion in capital expenditures for fiscal of the construction costs associated with the phoenix  arizona and columbia  south carolina plants 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal which will be used primarily for replacement  repair and improvement of our facilities and equipment 
net cash provided by discontinued operations of million in fiscal included the cash proceeds of million from the sale of our retail business which were used to pay down long term debt 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we amended the terms of our long term revolving credit facility to increase the maximum borrowing capacity by million to million 
we utilize the revolving credit line  coupled with cash flow from operations  to fund our short term liquidity needs 
we pay down or borrow against the revolving credit line on a daily basis based on cash flow from operations and forecasted cash requirements 
we borrowed against the revolving credit line to pay for the acquisitions of three healthcare laundry businesses completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal totaling million 
as of january   there was million of outstanding debt under the credit facility  of which million bore interest at a fixed rate of pursuant to an interest rate swap agreement plus the libor margin under the credit facility 
the libor margin as of january  was under the credit facility 
the remaining debt of million bore interest at  the prime rate as of january  on february   we entered into libor contracts for million and million which currently bear interest at plus the margin and plus the margin  respectively 
furthermore  we had million outstanding in irrevocable letters of credit as of january   which reduced the amount available to borrow under the line of credit to million 
these letters of credit are primarily issued to insurance carriers to secure our ability to pay our self insured workers compensation liabilities 
they automatically renew annually and may be amended from time to time based on collateral requirements of the carriers 
we pay a fee on the outstanding letters of credit and unused funds based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda as the terms are defined in the credit facility 
as of january   the fee on the outstanding letters of credit and unused funds was and  respectively 
we are subject to certain financial covenants under our loan agreement 
one of these covenants requires that we maintain a minimum consolidated net worth of plus an aggregate amount equal to of quarterly net income beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal with no reduction for net losses 
in addition we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to fixed charges of not less than to we are also required to maintain a ratio of funded debt to ebitda of not more than to 
this ratio will be reduced to a maximum of to effective april  as of january  we were in compliance with all loan covenants 
on january  we amended and restated the terms of the credit facility to add a million term loan commitment and a feature that allows us to seek an increase of million in the revolving credit line in the future 
on march   we borrowed the entire amount of the million term loan 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to fund the acquisition of royal institutional and surgi pack and reduce the amount outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
on april  we entered into a libor contract on the million outstanding under the term loan which bears interest at plus the margin 
in addition to the bank credit  we have approximately million of borrowing capacity against the million of cash value of our company owned life insurance policies at january  these life insurance policies were purchased by us on the lives of a number of officers and directors  both past and present 
we pay the premium and own the policy and carry the policy on our consolidated balance sheet at the cash value of the policy 
upon the death of any of the covered individuals  we receive the designated death benefit on the policy and may realize a gain to the extent that the death benefit exceeds the cash value 
management believes that our financial condition  operating cash flow and available sources of external funds are sufficient to satisfy our requirements for debt service  capital expenditures  dividends and working capital over the course of the next months 
however  if we pursue a large acquisition for which we pay cash as consideration for the assets purchased  we may require alternative funding sources to finance the purchase price 
contractual obligations future payments due under contractual obligations  aggregated by type of obligation  as of the end of fiscal are as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest   capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases    purchase obligations linen contracts natural gas contracts   deferred compensation and pension liabilities  total    future payments of long term debt include the million term loan borrowed on march   as discussed above and in note discontinued operations in february  our board of directors approved a plan to exit and discontinue our retail segment 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of our retail business were segregated  and its results of operations were reported in discontinued operations  effective in the first quarter of fiscal we continued to operate the segment while it was being actively marketed for sale 
we completed the sale of our retail business at the end of the second quarter of fiscal and recorded a loss on disposal of the discontinued segment of million net of tax in fiscal as part of the consideration for the sale  we received an unsecured  long term note from the buyer with a face value of million  which we discounted to its estimated fair value of approximately of face value 
although we believe that the discounted note is fairly valued  this note is not readily marketable and is subordinate to other outstanding debt of the issuer 
ultimately  the value of the note is dependent upon the success of the buyer in operating the purchased business 
there were retail stores that were not included in the sale of our retail segment  although the buyer did acquire the working capital related to those stores 
we immediately closed these stores and incurred million of costs in fiscal to terminate the leases 
from the beginning of the fiscal year until its ultimate sale in july  we operated the retail division as a discontinued operation 
during this period  we reported net loss from operations of our retail business of million 
this compares with a net operating loss of million for full fiscal year and net operating income of million for the full fiscal year 
the net operating loss and income for each of these prior years were reclassified as net loss or income from discontinued operations after the board s decision to exit the retail segment in the first quarter of fiscal net retail sales in the retail segment totaled million in fiscal  down million or from million in fiscal a same store sales decline of for the fiscal accounted for million of the decrease  partially offset by million of sales in the extra week of fiscal sales also decreased million in fiscal due to the closing of stores during fiscal years and gross margin of the retail segment of in fiscal was lower than the in fiscal fiscal gross margin included a gain of million  or of retail sales  from the reversal of an intercompany profit deferral due to the sale of the manufacturing segment 
as discussed in note  a pretax charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to write down the carrying amounts of long lived assets in certain underperforming stores to their fair values 
including the asset impairment charge  the retail business posted a pretax operating loss of million in fiscal compared with pretax operating income of million in fiscal we have agreed pursuant to the terms of the retail transaction to retain our guaranty on those real estate leases for retail stores that were supported with our guaranty on the date of the closing of the acquisition 
under the terms of our agreement with the buyer of the retail segment  our guaranty on each of these leases will remain until the end of the current term of the particular lease at which time it must be released 
we do not believe that we will incur any additional losses from these guarantees or any other issue arising from these discontinued operations in future periods 
in january  our board of directors approved a plan to discontinue our manufacturing segment and the assets of the segment were written down and a loss on disposal net of tax was recorded at year end of fiscal based on the estimated net realizable value from the pending sale of the business  as well as estimates of the costs of disposal and transition 
during fiscal  the sale and transition of the business to the buyers was completed and the assets of the segment were substantially liquidated 
an additional loss on disposal of million net of tax was recorded in fiscal to reflect the actual value received upon ultimate disposition of the segment s assets  including actual costs of disposition and transition 
of this amount  million was due to a reduction in the value of the inventories realized 
the remaining assets of the segment valued at million as of january  primarily consisting of accounts receivable and inventory  were disposed of in fiscal for amounts approximating their carrying values

to eliminate the exception to fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance

r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb no 
and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values and eliminates the alternative method of accounting for employee share based payments previously available under apb no 
historically  we have elected to follow the guidance of apb no 
which allowed companies to use the intrinsic value method of accounting to value their share based payment transactions with employees 
based on this method  we did not recognize compensation expense in its consolidated financial statements for stock options granted as the exercise price of the stock options granted was equal to or greater than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
sfas no 
r requires measurement of the cost of share based payment transactions with employees at the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognition of expense over the required service or vesting period 
the provisions of this statement are required to be adopted by us beginning in the third quarter of fiscal the impact of adoption of this statement on our net income in future periods will include the remaining amortization of the fair value of existing unamortized stock options currently disclosed as pro forma expense in note  and is contingent upon the number of future options granted  the selected transition method and the selection between acceptable valuation methodologies for valuing options
