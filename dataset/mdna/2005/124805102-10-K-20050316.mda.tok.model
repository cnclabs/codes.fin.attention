overview cbiz provides professional business services to businesses of various sizes  as well as individuals  governmental entities and not for profit enterprises throughout the united states see further description under items and business and properties 
the substantial portion of our revenue is derived from professional service activities provided for our clients  and our revenue is driven by our ability to generate new opportunities  by the prices we obtain for our service offerings and by the utilization of our professional workforce 
cbiz seeks to strengthen its operations and customer service capabilities by making acquisitions in markets where it currently operates and where the prospects are favorable to increase its market share and become a more significant provider of a comprehensive range of business services 
during  cbiz acquired benefits and brokerage firms in owing mills  md  and chicago  il  a technology firm in cleveland  oh and an accounting firm in denver  co 
cbiz will continue to actively seek acquisitions under the same strategy earlier described

cbiz continually evaluates its business operations  and may from time to time sell or close operations that are underperforming  located in secondary markets  or do not provide the level of synergistic cross serving opportunities with other cbiz businesses that is desired 
during  cbiz sold or closed five business operations in an effort to rationalize our business by divesting units that were either underperforming  located in secondary markets  or did not provide the level of synergistic cross serving opportunities with other cbiz businesses that is desired 
these divestitures are consistent with cbiz s plan to focus on metropolitan markets in which we can strengthen our core service offerings 
going forward  cbiz may  from time to time  recognize additional gains and or losses on divestitures 
cbiz believes that repurchasing shares of its common stock is a use of cash that provides value to stockholders  and accordingly completed a tender offer in april the tender offer resulted in the purchase of approximately million shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  or a total cost including expenses of approximately million 
in addition  cbiz completed open market repurchases of approximately million shares at a cost of approximately million during the year ended december  the credit facility and net cash provided by cbiz operations were utilized to fund the share repurchases 
on february   the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million shares of cbiz common stock during the shares may be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated purchases

results of operations continuing operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating practice groups cbiz currently delivers products and services through three practice groups 
a brief description of these groups operating results and factors affecting their businesses is provided below 
the services offered under each of these groups are described in part i of this report 
same unit revenue represents total revenue adjusted to reflect comparable periods of activity for acquisitions and divestitures 
for example  for an operation divested on july   revenue from the periods july through december  are reported as revenue from divested operations  thus  same unit revenue includes revenue for the periods january through june of both years 
revenue from divested operations represents operations that did not meet the criteria for treatment as discontinued businesses 
accounting  tax and advisory services 
change dollars in thousands revenue same unit    acquired businesses   divested operations   total revenue    percent of total cbiz revenue operating expenses    gross margin    gross margin percent same unit revenue for the twelve months ended december  increased by million or from the twelve months ended december  the growth experienced for same unit revenue was primarily due to an increase in the aggregate number of hours charged to clients for litigation support and sarbanes oxley consulting services  combined with modest price increases for traditional accounting and tax services 
the growth in revenue from acquisitions was primarily from sarbanes oxley consulting services provided by cbiz harborview  which was acquired in september  as well as accounting services provided by the acquisitions of firms in denver  colorado  and orange county  california 
divested operations represent several smaller units that did not provide opportunity for growth and cross serving capabilities 
the largest components of operating expenses for the ata group are personnel costs  occupancy costs and professional service fees paid to third parties  representing and of total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
personnel costs increased million primarily due to increases in staff to accommodate the revenue growth  as well as annual increases in compensation rates 
as a percentage of revenue  personnel costs were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
occupancy costs  which are generally fixed in nature  were and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
professional service fees paid to third parties increased million to percent of revenue for the year ended december  from for the same period a year ago  as the result of outsourced professional services utilized primarily at two business units  one unit that delivers services requiring specialization in state agency compliance and cbiz harborview that delivers sarbanes oxley consulting services 
gross margin has improved by for the twelve months ended december   primarily due to growth in sarbanes oxley consulting services  as well as modest increases in hourly billing rates 
cbiz expects sarbanes oxley consulting to continue to be strong  and also expects modest increases in hourly billing rates in for traditional accounting and tax services 
while the accounting industry is experiencing growth and increases in billing rates  the industry is also experiencing pricing pressures on compensation  as firms compete for qualified candidates in the market to support the revenue growth 
due to these pricing pressures on compensation  cbiz expects modest improvement in gross margin in benefits insurance services 
change dollars in thousands revenue same unit    acquired businesses   divested operations   total revenue    percent of total cbiz revenue operating expenses   gross margin    gross margin percent on a same unit basis  the benefits insurance b i group experienced a decrease in revenue of million  or for the twelve months ended december  compared to a year ago 
the decline in revenue is primarily attributable to one national business unit which experienced lower enrollments compared with a year ago  and recorded revenue adjustments resulting from higher policy terminations than originally estimated 
this decline was partially offset by the strength of the group health business  which has experienced an increase in the number of policies sold 
the increase in revenue from acquired businesses pertains to business units providing primarily group benefits and property and casualty services in the chicago  salt lake city  and maryland markets 
the decline in revenue from divested operations relates primarily to health administration services  which was sold in may the largest components of operating costs for the b i group are personnel costs  commissions paid to third party brokers  and occupancy costs  representing and of total operating expenses in and  respectively

commissions paid to third party brokers have increased to of revenue in from in  primarily due to a higher portion of revenue being generated with third party brokers during the current year than a year ago 
occupancy expenses are relatively fixed in nature  but have increased as a percent of revenue to for the twelve months ended december   from for the comparable period a year ago  primarily due to the decline in revenue previously discussed 
gross margin has decreased compared to a year ago  primarily as the result of the one national business unit mentioned above 
this unit has experienced significant growth over the last three years  which has resulted in system  client service and other operational challenges 
cbiz has allocated resources to support the current level of revenue and future growth  and is in the process of implementing new systems  including a new client service interface 
the decline in revenue  combined with higher expenses to support growth in this unit  have resulted in a negative impact on gross margin of approximately million 
cbiz believes that the resources dedicated to improve processes and controls at this insurance unit have positioned the unit for future growth  therefore  cbiz expects a significant improvement in revenue  and expects the unit to produce a modest profit in cbiz expects gross margins for the b i group to return to historical levels based on the favorable impact on this unit s future results  combined with continued organic growth from its existing retail businesses driven by a continuing increase in group health rates

generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations  warranties  covenants or agreements  related to such matters as title to assets sold and certain tax matters 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not been material 
as of december   we were not aware of any indemnification agreements that would require material payments 
interest rate risk management cbiz has used interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of its credit facility and related overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments to effectively convert floating rate debt into fixed rate debt based on a one  three  or six month us dollar libor 
interest rate swaps allow cbiz to maintain a target range of fixed to floating rate debt 
during june  cbiz paid its revolving credit facility balance down to zero  thus requiring it to terminate its interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap was scheduled to expire during august and carried a fixed rate of fixed libor rate of plus an applicable margin of 
during  management did not utilize interest rate swaps 
management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to the understanding of cbiz s consolidated financial statements because their application places significant demand on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that estimates may require adjustment if future events develop differently than forecasted 
revenue recognition and valuation of unbilled revenues revenue is recognized only when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our fee to the client is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured  which is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and sec staff accounting bulletin no

cbiz offers a vast array of products and business services to its clients 
those services are delivered through three practice groups 
a description of revenue recognition  as it relates to those groups  is provided below 
certain of our client arrangements encompass multiple deliverables 
cbiz accounts for these arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
if the deliverables meet the criteria in eitf  the deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and revenue is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative fair values 
revenue for each unit is recognized separately in accordance with cbiz s revenue recognition policy for each unit 
for those arrangements where the deliverables do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  revenue from all deliverables are treated as one accounting unit and recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of the arrangement 
accounting  tax and advisory services revenue consists primarily of fees for accounting services  preparation of tax returns and consulting services including sarbanes oxley consulting and compliance projects 
revenues are recorded in the period in which services are provided and meet revenue recognition criteria in accordance with sab cbiz bills clients based upon a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee or actual hours incurred on client projects at expected net realizable rates per hour  plus any out of pocket expenses 
the cumulative impact on any subsequent revision in the estimated realizable value of unbilled fees for a particular client project is reflected in the period in which the change becomes known 
through one of its ata units  cbiz provides flexible benefits administration services to clients  grants access of its proprietary software to third parties  and provides hosting to these parties 
revenue associated with set up and license fees related to our flexible benefits services are deferred and recognized pro rata over the life of the contract 
benefits insurance revenue consists primarily of brokerage and agency commissions  and fee income for administering health and retirement plans 
a description of the revenue recognition  based on the insurance product and billing arrangement  is described below commissions relating to brokerage and agency activities whereby cbiz has primary responsibility for the collection of premiums from insured s agency or indirect billing are recognized as of the latter of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date billed to the customer  commissions to be received directly from insurance companies direct billing are recognized when the policy becomes effective  and life insurance commissions are recognized when the policy becomes effective 
commission revenue is reported net of sub broker commissions 
commission revenue is reported net of reserves for estimated policy cancellations and terminations 
this reserve is based upon estimates and assumptions using historical cancellation and termination experience and other current factors to project future experience 
cbiz periodically reviews the adequacy of the reserve and makes adjustments as necessary 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
supplemental commissions  which are based upon certain performance targets  are recognized at the earlier of notification that the target has been achieved  or cash collection 
fee income is recognized in the period in which services are provided  and may be based on actual hours incurred on an hourly fee basis  fixed fee arrangements  or asset based fees 
national practices the business units that comprise this practice group offer a variety of services 
a description of revenue recognition associated with the primary services is provided below mergers acquisitions and capital advisory revenue associated with non refundable retainers is recognized on a pro rata basis over the life of the engagement 
revenue associated with success fee transactions is recognized when the transaction is completed 
technology consulting revenue associated with hardware and software sales is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of the product 
revenue associated with installation and service agreements is recognized as services are performed 
consulting revenue is recognized on an hourly or per diem fee basis as services are performed 
valuation and property tax revenue associated with retainer contracts is recognized on a pro rata basis over the life of the contract  which is generally twelve months 
revenue associated with contingency arrangements is recognized once written notification is received from an outside third party eg  assessor in the case of a property tax engagement acknowledging that the contingency has been resolved 
medical management group fees for services are primarily based on a percentage of net collections on our clients patient accounts receivable 
as such  revenue is determinable  earned  and recognized  when payments are received on our clients patient accounts 
valuation of accounts receivable and notes receivable the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable  including unbilled accounts receivable  related to current period service revenue 
management analyzes historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  the age of accounts receivable and current economic trends and conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the collectibility of notes receivable 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of goodwill effective january   cbiz adopted the non amortization provisions of sfas  and accordingly ceased amortization of our remaining goodwill balance 
cbiz evaluated the goodwill for impairment using the fair value impairment guidelines of sfas during  cbiz completed the process of evaluating our goodwill for impairment using the fair market impairment guidelines of sfas this change to a new method of accounting for goodwill resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million on a pretax basis million net of tax  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  cbiz evaluates goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
during and  there was no impairment of goodwill based on our annual evaluation 
loss contingencies loss contingencies  including litigation claims  are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis that often depends on judgment about potential actions by third parties 
estimates of incentive compensation costs and effective income tax rates incentive compensation costs and income tax expense are two significant expense categories that are highly dependent upon management estimates and judgments  particularly at each interim reporting date 
in arriving at the amount of expense to recognize  management believes it makes reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
incentive compensation costs are accrued on a monthly basis  and the ultimate determination is made after our year end results are finalized  thus  estimates are subject to change 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of effective income tax rates to change include the impact of information that subsequently became available as we prepared our corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
other significant policies other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
those policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the revised statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 share based payment fas r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which the company obtains employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for employee share based payment transactions using apb opinion no 
and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using the grant date fair value based method 
this statement will be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june fas r applies to all awards granted or modified after the statement s effective date 
in addition  compensation cost for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding on the statement s effective date shall be recognized on or after the effective date  as the related services are rendered  based on the awards grant date fair value as previously calculated for the pro forma disclosure under fas compensation expense calculated in accordance with sfas r in future periods may differ from the pro forma amounts disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herewith 
the amount of compensation expense will vary depending on the number of options granted in  the market value of our common stock and changes in other variables impacting stock option valuation estimates 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas r  we may choose to use a different valuation model to estimate stock option fair value 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
fas 
fas amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions 
the amendments made by fas are based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the provisions in fas are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  early application of the fas is permitted 
the provisions of this statement shall be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a material effect on cbiz s financial statements or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cbiz s floating rate debt under its credit facility exposes the company to interest rate risk 
a change in the federal funds rate  or the reference rate set by the bank of america san francisco  would affect the rate at which cbiz could borrow funds under its credit facility 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by basis points from the levels at december   interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million annually 
cbiz does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments 
cbiz has used interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of its credit facility and related overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments to effectively convert floating rate debt into fixed rate debt based on a one  three  or six month us dollar libor 
interest rate swaps allow cbiz to maintain a target range of fixed to floating rate debt 
management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions
