overview many of our key performance measures including net income and earnings per share continued to improve in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year in part  we attribute these improvements to our continued focus on diversifying our client base and product offerings 
this diversification  along with the overall increases in many foreign equity markets and to a lesser extent the u 
s 
markets  has led to increases in our assets under management driven from both market appreciation and positive net flows into our sponsored investment products 
we continually evaluate our business from the standpoint of profitability  product performance and client service  among other things  in light of our long term strategies 
our strategies of expanding our assets under management and related operations internationally  continually seeking positive investment performance  protecting and furthering our brand recognition  developing and maintaining broker dealer and client loyalties  providing a high level of customer service and closely monitoring costs  while also developing our human capital base and our systems and technology  and growing our investment management services all continue as objectives in the context of uncertain global market conditions 
general we derive the majority of our operating revenues  operating expenses and net income from providing investment management  fund administration  shareholder services  transfer agency  underwriting  distribution  custodial  trustee and other fiduciary services collectively investment management and related services to retail mutual funds  institutional accounts  high net worth clients  private accounts and other investment products 
this is our primary business activity and operating segment 
the mutual funds and other products that we serve  collectively called our sponsored investment products  are distributed to the public globally under six distinct names franklin templeton mutual series bissett fiduciary trust darby overseas our sponsored investment products include a broad range of global international equity  domestic us equity  hybrid  fixed income and money market mutual funds  and other investment products that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individuals and institutions 
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management 
to a lesser degree  our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts 
the fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients 
these arrangements could change in the future 
our secondary business and operating segment is banking finance 
our banking finance group offers selected retail banking services to high net worth individuals  foundations and institutions  and consumer

net income earnings per common share basic diluted operating margin net income increased by and diluted earnings per share increased by in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher fees for providing investment management and fund administration services investment management fees and underwriting and distribution fees consistent with a increase in our simple monthly average assets under management and higher gross sales on which commissions are earned 
in addition  we experienced a lower effective tax rate and a lower net charge to our provision for governmental investigations  proceedings and actions 
the resulting increase in net income was partially offset by higher underwriting and distribution  and compensation and benefits expenses 
the increase in diluted earnings per share in fiscal year was due to higher net income  partially offset by the effect of an increase in diluted weighted average shares outstanding to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  as the increase in diluted weighted average shares from the assumed conversion of stock options granted was greater than stock repurchases during fiscal year net income and diluted earnings per share increased by in fiscal year primarily due to higher operating revenues consistent with a increase in our simple monthly average assets under management  higher gross sales on which commissions are earned and an increase in billable shareholder accounts 
these increases were partially offset by higher underwriting and distribution expenses  higher compensation and benefit expense  the provision for governmental investigations  proceedings and actions and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal year as compared with the prior year 
the decline in diluted weighted average shares outstanding to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  also contributed to the increase in diluted earnings per common share 
the decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding resulted from stock repurchases  especially in the latter half of fiscal year  partially offset by an increase in dilution from the assumed conversion of stock options granted as the price of our common stock increased during fiscal year we restated diluted earnings per common share and diluted average shares outstanding for fiscal years and to reflect the adoption of the emerging issues task force issue no

underwriting and distribution fees we earn underwriting fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase 
sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum amounts 
therefore  underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales  the size of individual transactions  and the relative mix of sales between different share classes 
many of our sponsored investment products pay distribution fees in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
while other contractual arrangements exist in international jurisdictions  in the united states  distribution fees include b fees 
these fees are subject to maximum payout levels based on a percentage of the assets in each fund and other regulatory limitations 
see part i  item i of this report for a description of us underwriting and distribution fees by share class 
we pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf

we receive fees as compensation for providing varying levels of transfer agency services  including providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service and tax reporting

underwriting and distribution expenses increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year consistent with similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits increased during fiscal year  primarily resulting from an increase in bonus expense under the amended and restated annual incentive compensation plan  pursuant to which bonus awards have been made  based  in part  on our performance 
in addition  we experienced increases related to the annual merit salary adjustments effective in october  higher staffing levels and other employee benefits 
compensation and benefits increased during fiscal year  primarily resulting from an increase in bonus expense under the amended and restated annual incentive compensation plan  our annual merit salary adjustments effective in october and additional compensation and benefit costs related to the acquisition of darby overseas in october we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy 
as such  any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits going forward 
however  in order to attract and retain talented individuals  our level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue 
we employed approximately  people at september  as compared to about  at september  
table of contents information systems  technology and occupancy information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal year primarily due to higher building costs related to global expansion and an increase in technology consulting and outside market data services 
this increase was partially offset by a continued decrease in depreciation levels for equipment and software related to a decrease in purchases of information systems and technology equipment as certain of our technology equipment is periodically replaced with new equipment under our technology outsourcing agreement  and a decline in the number and scope of technology projects that have been completed and are therefore subject to amortization 
information systems  technology and occupancy costs decreased in fiscal year primarily due to lower depreciation levels for equipment and software related to a decrease in purchases of information systems and technology equipment and the stabilization in the number and scope of new technology project initiatives 
the decrease was partly offset by an increase in market data services and building depreciation 
details of capitalized information systems and technology costs  which exclude occupancy costs  were as follows for the last three fiscal years in millions net carrying amount at beginning of period additions during period  net of disposals and other adjustments net assets added through acquisitions amortization during period net carrying amount at end of period advertising and promotion advertising and promotion increased in fiscal year due to an increase in direct advertising campaigns and marketing and promotion efforts globally 
advertising and promotion increased in fiscal year  due to the elimination of directed brokerage effective november  and higher expenditures on direct advertising campaigns and marketing materials 
we are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions  and in order to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities  which means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly  or decrease more slowly  than our revenues 
in addition to potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns  advertising and promotion may also be impacted by changes in levels of sales and assets under management that affect marketing support payments made to the distributors of our sponsored investment products 
amortization of deferred sales commissions certain fund share classes globally  including class b in the united states  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  although our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale 
furthermore  in the united states  class a shares are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met and class c shares have been sold without a front end sales charge since january  however  our us distribution subsidiary pays a commission on these sales 
we defer all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries and amortize them over months to years depending on share class or financing arrangements 

table of contents class b and certain of our class c deferred commission assets dca arising from our us  canadian and european operations are financed through lightning finance company limited lfl  a company in which we have a ownership interest 
lfl has entered into a financing agreement with our us distribution subsidiary and we maintain a continuing interest in the dca transferred to lfl until resold by lfl 
as a result  we retain dca sold to lfl under the us agreement and a corresponding financing liability in our financial statements and amortize them over an year period  or until sold by lfl to third parties 
in contrast to the us arrangement  lfl has entered into direct agreements with our canadian and european sponsored investment products  and  as a result  we do not record dca from these sources in our financial statements 
the us funds that had offered class b shares ceased offering these shares to new investors and existing shareholders effective during the quarter ended march  existing class b shareholders may continue to exchange shares into class b shares of different funds 
existing class b shareholders may also continue to reinvest dividends in additional class b shares 
the cessation of purchases of class b shares by new investors and existing shareholders may have a negative effect on the overall sales of the funds shares and cause a decrease in the levels of deferred commission amortization 
amortization of deferred sales commissions increased in fiscal year and in fiscal year primarily due to increased gross product sales and because lfl did not sell any us dca in a securitization transaction in either year 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal year and increased in fiscal year  primarily due to foreign currency movements in intangible assets not denominated in us dollars 
as of march   we completed our most recent annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under fasb statement of financial accounting standards no

the increase was partially offset by higher interest expense related to the issuance of five year senior notes in april taxes on income as a multi national corporation  we provide investment management and related services to a wide range of international investment products  often managed from locations outside the united states 
some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the united states 
the mix of pre tax income primarily from our investment management and related services business subject to these lower rates  when aggregated with income originating in the united states  produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing us federal and state income tax rates 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal year decreased to  as compared to in and in fiscal year income taxes were provided at a reduced rate for fiscal year due primarily to a favorable state tax ruling  obtained in fiscal year  which results in a refund of tax from multiple prior years 
going forward  the effective income tax rate will continue to reflect the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income  as well as other factors  including a reduction in our state tax liabilities due to the favorable state tax ruling which is in effect through fiscal year

cash and cash equivalents include cash  debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the purchase date and other highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash  including money market funds 
cash and cash equivalents increased from september  as we invested operating cash flows in debt instruments  including term deposits  us t bills and other interest bearing deposits  with maturities of three months or less from the purchase date 
the increase in total debt outstanding from september  relates primarily to the issuance of a variable funding note variable funding note payable under a one year revolving million variable funding note warehouse credit facility secured by cash and or automobile loans  and the increase in the long term financing liability recognized in relation to us dca financed by lfl 
we experienced higher operating cash flows in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  due to higher net income and an increase in other liabilities in fiscal year  and an increase in trading securities  net in fiscal year  partially offset by higher originations of loans held for sale in fiscal year in fiscal year  we experienced net cash used in investing activities as compared to net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year  due primarily to excess purchases of investments over liquidations and additions of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  principally due to a special cash dividend that was declared on march  and paid on april  to holders of record of our common stock on march  the per share special cash dividend returned million to investors 
cash used in financing activities also increased as a result of repurchases of our common stock 
in fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
at september   approximately million shares remained available for repurchase under our existing stock repurchase program 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million in fiscal year 
table of contents  and million shares at a cost of million  including common stock repurchased under put option agreements  in fiscal year capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under current credit facilities  the ability to issue debt or equity securities  and mutual fund sales commission financing arrangements 
in particular  we expect to finance future investment in our banking finance activities through operating cash flows  debt  increased deposit base  and through the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities 
as of september   we had million of debt and equity securities available to be issued under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and million of additional commercial paper available for issuance 
on june   we entered into a million five year facility credit agreement with certain banks and financial institutions 
the five year facility credit agreement replaced our million day revolving credit facility  which matured by its terms on june   and our million five year revolving credit facility  which was terminated on june   prior to its scheduled expiration date of june  there were no amounts outstanding under either the former day or the former five year credit facilities on the respective dates of termination and no early termination penalties were incurred by us 
at september   the five year facility credit agreement was undrawn and available 
in addition  at september   our banking finance operating segment had million in available uncommitted short term bank lines under the federal reserve funds system  the federal reserve bank discount window  and federal home loan bank short term borrowing capacity 
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating  the condition of the global economy  investors willingness to purchase our securities  interest rates  credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets 
in extreme circumstances  we might not be able to access this liquidity readily 
our investment management and related services operating segment finances class b and certain class c dca arising from our us  canadian and european operations through lfl  a company in which we have a ownership interest 
class b and c sales commissions that we have financed globally through lfl during fiscal year  were approximately million compared to million in fiscal year as noted above  the us funds that had offered class b shares ceased offering these shares to new investors and existing shareholders effective during the quarter ended march  existing class b shareholders may continue to exchange shares into class b shares of different funds as well as reinvest dividends in additional class b shares 
as a result  we expect a continued decrease in dca financed through lfl in future years 
lfl s ability to access credit facilities and the securitization market will also directly affect our existing financing arrangements 
our banking finance operating segment finances its automotive lending activities through operational cash flows  the issuance of notes under a variable funding note warehouse credit facility  inter segment loans and by selling its auto loans in securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities  which then issue asset backed securities to private investors 
gross sale proceeds from auto loan securitization transactions were million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as noted above  in march  our subsidiary  franklin capital corporation  entered into definitive agreements to create a new one year revolving million variable funding note warehouse credit facility 
under these agreements  and through a special purpose statutory trust the trust  we issued the variable funding note payable to certain administered conduits in the amount of up to million 
security for the repayment of the variable funding note consists of cash and or a pool of automobile loans 
table of contents that meet certain eligibility requirements 
credit enhancements for the variable funding note require us to provide as collateral loans held for sale with a fair value in excess of the value of the variable funding note  as well as to hold in trust additional cash balances to cover certain shortfalls 
in addition  we provide a payment provider commitment in an amount not to exceed of the pool balance 
directly and through the trust  we also entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk between the fixed interest rate on the pool of automobile loans and the floating interest rate being paid on the variable funding note 
in december  we entered into an auto loan securitization transaction for the sale of loans held for sale with a carrying value of approximately million  which included loans held by the trust 
total pre tax gain recorded on this sale was approximately million  including a gain on the interest rate swap  net of market gains already recognized in income during fiscal year our ability to access the securitization and capital markets will directly affect our plans to finance the auto loan portfolio in the future 
uses of capital we expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core business  make strategic acquisitions  acquire shares of our common stock  fund property and equipment purchases  pay operating expenses of the business  enhance technology infrastructure and business processes  pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt 
in may  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of million principal amount at maturity of liquid yield option notes due zero coupon senior the convertible notes 
the issue price of the convertible notes  which were offered to qualified institutional buyers only  represented a yield to maturity of per annum excluding any contingent interest 
each of the  principal amount at maturity convertible notes will become convertible prior to maturity into shares of our common stock subject to adjustment following the occurrence of certain specified triggering events 
in particular  the convertible notes will become convertible if  during any calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than a specified percentage initially as of the third quarter of fiscal year and declining each quarter thereafter of the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter 
based on this formula  the convertible notes were not convertible during the quarter ended september  however  holders may convert their convertible notes during the quarter ending december  because the closing sale price of our common stock during the quarter ended september  for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarter was more than of  which was the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the quarter 
at december   million of these notes have been tendered for conversion 
the convertible notes also will become convertible prior to maturity if i the assigned credit rating by moody s or standard and poor s of the convertible notes is at or below baa or bbb  respectively  ii the convertible notes are called for redemption  or iii certain specified corporate transactions have occurred 
separately  we will pay contingent interest to the holders of convertible notes during any six month period commencing may  if the average market price of a convertible note for a measurement period preceding such six month period equals or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount 
through september   we have repurchased convertible notes with a face value of million principal amount at maturity  for their accreted value of million  in cash 
we may redeem the remaining convertible notes for cash on or after may  or  at the option of the holders  we may be required to make additional repurchases on may in each of   
table of contents and in this event  we may choose to pay the accreted value of the convertible notes in cash or shares of our common stock 
the amount that the holders may redeem in the future will depend on  among other factors  the performance of our common stock

 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp fas 
the american jobs creation act of the jobs act was signed into law on october  under a provision of the jobs act  we may elect to repatriate certain earnings of our foreign based subsidiaries at a reduced us federal tax rate in either of our fiscal years ended september  or ending september  fsp fas provides guidance on when an enterprise should recognize in its financial statements the effects of the one time tax benefit of repatriation of foreign earnings under the jobs act  and specifies interim disclosure requirements 
we are currently evaluating the effect of the repatriation provision under the jobs act 
we expect to complete this evaluation no earlier than the second quarter of fiscal year the range of possible amounts we are considering for repatriation is between zero and  million  and the potential range of federal and state income tax associated with these amounts  which are subject to a reduced tax rate  is between zero and million 
we continue to look for opportunities to control our costs and expand our global presence 
in this regard  we have recently committed approximately million to acquire land and build a campus in hyderabad  india  to establish support services for several of our global functions 
at september   we have incurred approximately million of these costs 
we expect to complete and occupy the campus in fiscal year contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes contractual cash obligations and commitments at september  we believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities

in particular  under an agreement to outsource management of our data center and distributed server operations that we can terminate any time after july   we estimate that the termination fee payable in july  not including costs associated with assuming equipment leases  would approximate million and would decrease each month for the subsequent two years  reaching a payment of approximately million in july capital contribution commitments relate to our contractual commitments to fund certain of our sponsored investment products 

table of contents contingent obligations in relation to the auto loan securitization transactions that we have entered into with a number of qualified special purpose entities  we are obligated to cover shortfalls in amounts due to note holders up to certain levels as specified in the related agreements 
at september   the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these obligations was million 
in addition  our consolidated balance sheet at september  included a million liability to reflect the fair value of these obligations arising from auto securitization transactions entered into subsequent to december  at september   the banking finance operating segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers  primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers 
these standby letters of credit  issued prior to january   were secured by marketable securities with a fair value of million at september  and commercial real estate 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed above  we obtain financing for sales commissions that we pay to broker dealers on class b and certain class c shares of our sponsored investment products through lfl  a company established in ireland to provide dca financing 
we hold a ownership interest in lfl and we account for this ownership interest using the equity method of accounting 
our exposure to loss related to our investment in lfl is limited to the carrying value of our investment  and interest and fees receivable from lfl 
at september   those amounts approximated million 
during fiscal year  we recognized pre tax income of approximately million for our share of its net income over this period 
as discussed above  our banking finance operating segment periodically enters into auto loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities  which then issue asset backed securities to private investors 
our main objective in entering into these securitization transactions is to obtain financing for auto loan activities 
securitized loans held by the securitization trusts totaled million at september  and million at september  critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
for additional information about our accounting policies  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of intangibles on an ongoing basis 
under sfas  we are required to test the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles when there is an indication of impairment  or at least once a year 
goodwill impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value  calculated based on anticipated discounted cash flows 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 

table of contents intangible assets subject to amortization are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if such a test were to indicate that the carrying value of the assets exceeded the undiscounted cash flow expected to result from their use and eventual disposition  an impairment loss would be recognized as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeded their fair value 
in performing our analysis  we used certain assumptions and estimates including those related to discount rates and the expected future period of cash flows to be derived from the assets  based on  among other factors  historical trends and the characteristics of the assets 
while we believe that our testing was appropriate  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense 
income taxes as a multinational corporation  we operate in various locations outside the united states 
as of september   and based on tax laws in effect as of this date  it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  we have not made a provision for us taxes and have not recorded a deferred tax liability on  million of cumulative undistributed earnings recorded by foreign subsidiaries as of september  changes to our policy of reinvesting foreign earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of investments we record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  we estimate the value of the securities based upon available information 
however  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  some assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for example  we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current carrying value 
we evaluate our investments for other than temporary decline in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the carrying value for an extended period of time 
as most of our investments are carried at fair value  if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist  the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income  in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
we classify securities as trading when it is management s intent at the time of purchase to sell the security within a short period of time 
accordingly  we record unrealized gains and losses on these securities in our consolidated income 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements 
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of 
table of contents the claims based on the facts available at that time 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of september  to provide for any probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount

variable interest entities under fin r  a variable interest entity vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment 
fin r requires consolidation of a vie by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership  referred to as the primary beneficiary 
evaluating whether related entities are vies  and determining if we qualify as the primary beneficiary of these vies  is highly complex and involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
to determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of each vie  we performed an expected cash flow analysis using certain discount rate and volatility assumptions based on available historical information and management s estimates 
based on our analysis  we consolidated one vie into our financial statements as of september  while we believe that our testing and approach were appropriate  future changes in estimates and assumptions may affect our decision and lead to the consolidation of other vies in our financial statements

table of contents risk factors we are subject to extensive and often complex  overlapping and frequently changing regulation domestically and abroad 
our investment management and related services business and our banking finance business are subject to extensive and often complex  overlapping and frequently changing regulation in the united states and abroad  including  among others  securities  banking  accounting and tax laws and regulations 
moreover  financial reporting requirements  and the processes  controls and procedures that have been put in place to address them  are often comprehensive and complex 
while management has focused attention and resources on our compliance policies  procedures and practices  non compliance with applicable laws or rules or regulations  either in the united states or abroad  or our inability to keep up with  or adapt to  an often ever changing  complex regulatory environment could result in sanctions against us  including fines and censures  injunctive relief  suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market or the revocation of licenses  any of which could also adversely affect our reputation  prospects  revenues  and earnings 
we are subject to federal securities laws  state laws regarding securities fraud  other federal and state laws and rules and regulations of certain regulatory and self regulatory organizations  including those rules and regulations promulgated by  among others  the sec  the nasd  nyse and pcx  and to the extent operations or trading in our securities take place outside the united states  by foreign regulations and regulators  such as the uk listing authority 
certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of  as amended  and many of our funds are registered with the sec under the investment company act of  as amended  both of which impose numerous obligations  as well as detailed operational requirements  on our subsidiaries which are investment advisers to registered investment companies 
our subsidiaries  both in the united states and abroad  must comply with a myriad of complex and often changing us and or foreign regulations  some of which may conflict  including complex us and us tax regimes 
additionally  as we expand our operations  sometimes rapidly  into non us jurisdictions  the rules and regulations of these non us jurisdictions become applicable  sometimes with short compliance deadlines  and add further regulatory complexity to our ongoing compliance operations 
in addition  we are a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve board  or frb  and are subject to the restrictions  limitations  or prohibitions of the bank holding company act of and the gramm leach bliley act 
the frb may impose additional limitations or restrictions on our activities  including if the frb believes that we do not have the appropriate financial and managerial resources to commence or conduct an activity or make an acquisition 
further  our subsidiary  fiduciary trust  is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the fdic and new york state banking department  while another of our subsidiaries is subject to oversight by the office of thrift supervision 
the laws and regulations of these regulators generally impose restrictions and requirements in connection with a variety of technical  specialized and recently expanding matters and concerns 
for example  compliance with anti money laundering requirements  both domestically and internationally  and the bank secrecy act has taken on heightened importance with regulators as a result of efforts to  among other things  limit terrorism 
as we continue to address these requirements or focus on meeting new or expanded ones  we may expend a substantial amount of time and resources  even though our banking finance business does not constitute our dominant business sector 
moreover  any inability to meet these requirements  within the timeframes set by regulators  may subject us to sanctions or other restrictions by the regulators that impact our broader business 
regulatory and legislative actions and reforms  particularly those specifically focused on the mutual fund industry  are making the regulatory environment in which we operate more costly and future actions and reforms could adversely impact our assets under management  increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and future financial results 
during the past five years  the federal securities laws have been augmented substantially and made significantly more complex by  among other measures  the sarbanes oxley act of and the usa patriot act of moreover  changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations have directly affected our business 
with new laws and changes 
table of contents in interpretation and enforcement of existing requirements  the associated time we must dedicate to  and related costs we must incur in  meeting the regulatory complexities of our business have increased and these outlays have also increased as we expand our business into various non us jurisdictions 
for example  in the past few years following the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of  new rules of the sec  the nyse  pcx and nasd were promulgated and other rules revised 
among other things  these new laws  rules and regulations have necessitated us to make changes to our corporate governance and public disclosure policies  procedures and practices and our registered investment companies and investment advisers have been required to make similar changes 
compliance activities to meet these new requirements have required us to expend additional time and resources  including without limitation substantial efforts to conduct evaluations required to ensure compliance with the management certification and attestation requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  and  consequently  we are incurring increased costs of doing business  which potentially negatively impacts our profitability and future financial results 
moreover  current and pending regulatory and legislative actions and reforms affecting the mutual fund industry  including compliance initiatives  may negatively impact revenues by increasing our costs of accessing or dealing in the financial markets 
any significant limitation or failure of our software applications and other technology systems that are critical to our operations could constrain our operations 
we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and third party software applications and other technology systems to operate our business 
we use our technology to  among other things  obtain securities pricing information  process client transactions and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage 
any inaccuracies  delays or systems failures in these and other processes could subject us to client dissatisfaction and losses 
although we take protective measures  our technology systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other events that have a security impact  such as an authorized employee or vendor inadvertently causing us to release confidential information  which could materially damage our operations or cause the disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information 
moreover  loss of confidential customer identification information could harm our reputation 
most of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from  and supported  upgraded and maintained by  third party vendors 
a suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support  upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruption 
in addition  we have outsourced to a single vendor management of our data center and distributed server operations  and this vendor also is responsible for our disaster recovery systems 
a failure by this vendor to continue to manage our data center or support our servers and our disaster recovery systems adequately in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business 
moreover  although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans  we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters  power failures  acts of war  and third party failures 
potential system failures or breaches and the cost necessary to correct them could result in material financial loss  regulatory actions  breach of client contracts  reputational harm or legal claims and liability  which in turn could negatively impact our revenues and income 
we face risks  and corresponding potential costs and expenses  associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous foreign countries 
we sell mutual funds and offer investment management and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world  and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally 
as we do so  we will continue to face various ongoing challenges to ensure that we have sufficient resources  procedures and controls in place to address and ensure that our operations abroad operate consistently and effectively 
local regulatory environments may vary widely  as may the adequacy and sophistication of each 
similarly  local distributors  and their policies and practices as well as financial viability  may be inconsistent or less developed or mature 
notwithstanding potential long term cost savings by increasing certain operations  such as transfer agent and other back office operations  in countries or regions of the world with lower operating costs  growth of our international operations may involve near term increases in expenses as well as additional capital costs  
table of contents such as information  systems and technology costs and costs related to compliance with particular regulatory or other local requirements or needs 
local requirements or needs may also place additional demands on sales and compliance personnel and resources  such as meeting local language requirements while also integrating personnel into an organization with a single operating language 
finding and hiring additional  well qualified personnel and crafting and adopting policies  procedures and controls to address local or regional requirements remain a challenge as we expand our operations internationally 
moreover  regulators in non us jurisdictions could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or register investment products in their respective markets 
any of these local requirements  activities or needs could increase the costs and expenses we incur in a specific jurisdiction without any corresponding increase in revenues and income from operating in the jurisdiction 
we depend on key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 
the success of our business will continue to depend upon our key personnel  including our portfolio and fund managers  investment analysts  investment advisers  sales and management personnel and other professionals as well as our executive officers and business unit heads 
in a tightening labor market  competition for qualified  motivated and highly skilled executives  professional and other key personnel in the asset management and banking finance industries remains significant 
our success depends to a substantial degree upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified individuals  including through competitive compensation packages  and upon the continued contributions of these people 
as our business grows  we are likely to need to increase correspondingly the overall number of individuals that we employ 
moreover  in order to retain certain key personnel  we may be required to increase compensation to such individuals  resulting in additional expense without a corresponding increase in potential revenue 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified individuals  and departure of key investment personnel  in particular  if not replaced  could cause us to lose clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
moreover  our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
the loss of the services of key personnel or our failure to attract replacement or additional qualified personnel could negatively affect our financial performance 
strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies with competing offerings and products could limit or reduce sales of our products  potentially resulting in a decline in our market share  revenues and net income 
we compete with numerous asset management companies  mutual fund  stock brokerage and investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  savings and loan associations and other financial institutions 
our investment products also compete with products offered by these competitors as well as real estate investment trusts  hedge funds and others 
over the past decade  a significant number of new asset management firms and mutual funds have been established  increasing competition 
at the same time  consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own 
competition is based on various factors  including  among others  business reputation  investment performance  product offerings  service quality  distribution relationships  and fees charged 
additionally  competing securities broker dealers whom we rely upon to distribute and sell our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products  which could limit the distribution of our investment products 
to the extent that existing or potential customers  including securities broker dealers  decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors  the sales of our products as well as our market share  revenues and net income could decline 
our ability to attract and retain assets under our management is also dependent on the relative investment performance of our funds and other managed investment portfolios and our ability to maintain our investment management services fees at competitive levels 
changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth 
we derive nearly all of our fund sales through broker dealers and other similar investment advisers 

table of contents increasing competition for these distribution channels and recent regulatory initiatives have caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future or could otherwise negatively impact the distribution of our products 
higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings 
additionally  if one or more of the major financial advisers who distribute our products were to cease operations or limit or otherwise end the distribution of our products  it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
there is no assurance we will continue to have access to the third party broker dealers and similar investment advisers that currently distribute our products  or continue to have the opportunity to offer all or some of our existing products through them 
a failure to maintain strong business relationships with the major investment advisers who currently distribute our products may also impair our distribution and sales operations 
because we use broker dealers and other similar investment advisers to sell our products  we do not control the ultimate investment recommendations given to clients 
any inability to access and successfully sell our products to clients through third party distribution channels could have a negative effect on our level of assets under management  related revenues and overall business and financial condition 
the amount or mix of our assets under management are subject to significant fluctuations and could negatively impact our revenues and income 
we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global financial and equity markets 
individual financial and equity markets may be adversely affected by political  financial or other instabilities that are particular to the country or regions in which a market is located  including without limitation local acts of terrorism  economic crises or other business  social or political crises 
declines in these markets have caused in the past  and would cause in the future  a decline in our revenues and income 
global economic conditions  exacerbated by war or terrorism or financial crises  changes in the equity market place  currency exchange rates  interest rates  inflation rates  the yield curve and other factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix  market values and levels of our assets under management 
our investment management services revenues are derived primarily from fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management and vary with the nature of the account or product managed 
a decline in the price of stocks or bonds  or in particular market segments  or in the securities market generally  could cause the value and returns on our assets under management to decline  resulting in a decline in our revenues and income 
moreover  changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix between international and us assets  potentially resulting in a decline in our revenue and income depending upon the nature of our assets under management and the level of investment management fees we earn based on them 
additionally  changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products and a related decline in our revenue and income  as we generally derive higher fee revenues and income from equity assets than from fixed income products we manage 
on the other hand  increases in interest rates  in particular if rapid  or high interest rates  as well as any uncertainty in the future direction of interest rates  may impact negatively on our fixed income products as rising interest rates or interest rate uncertainty typically decrease the total return on many bond investments due to lower market valuations of existing bonds 
any decrease in the level of assets under management resulting from price declines  interest rate volatility or uncertainty or other factors could negatively impact our revenues and income 
our increasing focus on international markets as a source of investments and sales of investment products subject us to increased exchange rate and other risks in connection with earnings and income generated overseas 
while we operate primarily in the united states  we also provide services and earn revenues in canada  the bahamas  europe  asia  south america  africa and australia 
as a result  we are subject to foreign exchange risk through our foreign operations 
while we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk  for example  by denominating a significant amount of our transactions in us dollars  the situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states 
stabilization or appreciation of the us dollar could moderate revenues from sales of investment products internationally 
separately  investment management fees that we earn tend to be higher in 
table of contents connection with international assets under management than with us assets under management 
consequently  a downturn in international markets could have a significant effect on our revenues and income 
poor investment performance of our products could affect our sales or reduce the level of assets under management  potentially negatively impacting our revenues and income 
our investment performance  along with achieving and maintaining superior distribution and client services  is critical to the success of our investment management and related services business 
strong investment performance often stimulates sales of our investment products 
poor investment performance as compared to third party benchmarks or competitive products could lead to a decrease in sales of investment products we manage and stimulate redemptions from existing products  generally lowering the overall level of assets under management and reducing the investment management fees we earn 
we cannot assure you that past or present investment performance in the investment products we manage will be indicative of future performance 
any poor future performance may negatively impact our revenues and income 
we could suffer losses in earnings or revenue if our reputation is harmed 
our reputation is important to the success of our business 
the franklin templeton investments brand has been  and continues to be  extremely well received both in our industry and with our clients  reflecting the fact that our brand  like our business  is based in part on trust and confidence 
if our reputation is harmed  existing clients may reduce amounts held in  or withdraw entirely from  funds that we advise or funds may terminate their investment management agreements with us  which could reduce the amount of assets under management and cause us to suffer a corresponding loss in earnings or revenue 
moreover  reputational harm may cause us to lose current employees and we may be unable to continue to attract new ones with similar qualifications  motivations or skills 
if we fail to address  or appear to fail to address  successfully and promptly the underlying causes of any reputational harm  we may be unsuccessful in repairing any existing harm to our reputation and our future business prospects would likely be affected 
our future results are dependent upon maintaining an appropriate level of expenses  which are subject to fluctuation 
the level of our expenses are subject to fluctuation and may increase for the following or other reasons changes in the level and scope of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions  variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  changes in expenses and capital costs  including costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure  and an increase in insurance expenses including through the assumption of higher deductibles and or co insurance liability 
our ability to successfully integrate widely varied business lines can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations 
our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business  both domestically and abroad  depends on our ability to integrate the varied accounting  financial  information and operational systems of our various businesses on a global basis 
moreover  adapting or developing our existing technology systems to meet our internal needs  as well as client needs  industry demands and new regulatory requirements  is also critical for our business 
the constant introduction of new technologies presents new challenges to us 
we have an ongoing need to continually upgrade and improve our various technology systems  including our data processing  financial  accounting and trading systems 
this need could present operational issues or require  from time to time  significant capital spending 
it also may require us to reevaluate the current value and or expected useful lives of our technology systems  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss  loss of human capital  regulatory actions  reputational harm or legal liability 
should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem  our 
table of contents continued success will depend  in part  on the availability of our personnel  our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer  telecommunication and other related systems and operations 
while our operational size  the diversity of locations from which we operate  and our redundant back up systems provide us with a strong advantage should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event  we could still experience near term operational challenges  in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular segments of our operations  such as key executive officers or personnel in our technology group 
recent disaster recovery efforts  such as in response to hurricane wilma on our fort lauderdale  florida operations  have demonstrated that even seemingly localized events may require broader disaster recovery efforts throughout our operations and  consequently  we are constantly assessing and taking steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession 
however  a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas across regions  or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem  could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss  loss of human capital  regulatory actions  reputational harm or legal liability 
our ability to meet cash needs depends upon certain factors  including our asset value  credit worthiness and the market value of our stock 
our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value  our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock 
similarly  our ability to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables  and to obtain continued financing for certain class c shares  is also subject to the market s perception of those assets  finance rates offered by competitors  and the general market for private debt 
if we are unable to obtain these funds and financing  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans 
certain of the portfolios we manage  including our emerging market portfolios  are vulnerable to market specific political  economic or other risks  any of which may negatively impact our revenues and income 
our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political  economic  and diplomatic developments  currency fluctuations  social instability  changes in governmental polices  expropriation  nationalization  asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership 
foreign trading markets  particularly in some emerging market countries  are often smaller  less liquid  less regulated and significantly more volatile than the us and other established markets 
our revenues  earnings and income could be adversely affected if the terms of our investment management agreements are significantly altered or these agreements are terminated by the funds we advise 
our revenues are dependent on fees earned under investment management and related services agreements that we have with the funds we advise 
these revenues could be adversely affected if these agreements are altered significantly or terminated 
the decline in revenue that might result from alteration or termination of our investment management services agreements could have a material adverse impact on our earnings or income 
diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans 
we compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans  which can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales or in some cases zero interest rates 
our inability to compete effectively against these companies or to maintain our relationships with the various automobile dealers through whom we offer consumer loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan business 
economic and credit market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans  which could cause losses to our consumer loan portfolio 
future sales of our common stock in the public market  such as upon conversion of our outstanding convertible securities  could adversely affect our stock price 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future 
table of contents sales of shares of our common stock or the availability for future sales of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time 
for example  in connection with our may offering of convertible notes  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec  which was subsequently declared effective  to register  among other things  approximately million shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes 
holders may convert their convertible notes prior to maturity into shares of our common stock per  principal amount at maturity of the convertible notes  subject to adjustment  following the occurrence of certain specified triggering events  including if  during any calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than a specified percentage  initially as of the third quarter of fiscal year and declining each quarter thereafter  of the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter 
based on this formula  holders may convert their convertible notes during the quarter ending december  because  during the quarter ended september   the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarter was more than of  which was the accreted conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the quarter 
sale  or the availability for sale  of substantial amounts of common stock by our existing stockholders pursuant to an effective registration statement or under rule  through the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options or the conversion of convertible securities  such as our convertible notes  or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
civil litigation arising out of or relating to previously settled governmental investigations or other matters  governmental or regulatory investigations and or examinations and the legal risks associated with our business could adversely impact our assets under management  increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and or our future financial results 
we have been named in shareholder class action and other lawsuits  many of which arise out of or relate to previously settled governmental investigations 
while management believes that the claims made in these lawsuits are without merit  and while we intend to vigorously defend against them  litigation typically is an expensive process 
risks associated with legal liability often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time 
moreover  settlements or judgments against us have the potential of being substantial if we are unsuccessful in settling or otherwise resolving matters early in the process and or on favorable terms 
it is also possible that we may be named in additional civil or governmental actions similar to those already instituted 
from time to time we may receive requests for documents or other information from governmental authorities or regulatory bodies or we also may become the subject of governmental or regulatory investigations and or examinations 
moreover  governmental or regulatory investigations or examinations that have been inactive could become active 
we may be obligated  and under our standard form of indemnification agreement with certain officers and directors in some instances we are obligated  or we may choose  to indemnify directors  officers or employees against liabilities and expenses they may incur in connection with such matters to the extent permitted under applicable law 
eventual exposures from and expenses incurred relating to current and future litigation  investigations  examinations and settlements could adversely impact our assets under management  increase costs and negatively impact our profitability and or our future financial results 
judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities or in civil litigation against us could affect our reputation  increase our costs of doing business and or negatively impact our revenues  any of which could have a material negative impact on our financial results

in our banking finance operating segment  we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets  as well as funding sources 
our investment management and related services operating segment is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily through its investment in debt securities and its outstanding debt 
we minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities  and through diversification

we are subject to foreign exchange risk through our foreign operations 
we operate primarily in the united states  but also provide services and earn revenues in canada  the bahamas  europe  asia  south america  africa and australia 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimized since a significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states 
we are exposed to equity price fluctuations through securities we hold that are carried at fair value and through investments held by majority owned sponsored investment products that we consolidate 
to mitigate this risk  we maintain a diversified investment portfolio 
our exposure to equity price fluctuations is also minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions
