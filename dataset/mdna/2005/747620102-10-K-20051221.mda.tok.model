overview fiscal was a record year 
record net sales of  million was an increase of over the previous record level in fiscal the net sales increases over the last several years is attributable to strong demand in  increased average selling prices in  and improved mix for both and coupled with the addition of acquisitions during both fiscal and fiscal excluding the impact of the recent acquisitions macsteel monroe  truseal and mikron  net sales increased and in fiscal and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal were  almost triple year ago results of per share 
fiscal diluted earnings per share were per share 
fiscal results benefited from particularly strong demand that was offset by significant raw material increases  whereas fiscal was a year of somewhat weaker demand with margin expansion due to higher base prices coupled with a decline of ferrous and aluminum scrap costs 
business segments business segments are reported in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas 
sfas requires that the company disclose certain information about its operating segments where operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
quanex has two market focused segments vehicular products and building products 
the vehicular products segment produces engineered steel bars for the light vehicle  heavy duty truck  agricultural  defense  capital goods  recreational and energy markets 
the vehicular products segment s primary market drivers are north american light vehicle builds and  to a lesser extent  heavy duty truck builds 
the building products segment produces engineered products and components serving the window and door industry  and mill finished and coated aluminum sheet serving the broader building products markets 
the main market drivers of this segment are residential housing starts and remodeling expenditures 
vehicular products three years ended october  the vehicular products segment reported record net sales and operating income in fiscal the segment s primary market drivers are north american light vehicle production approximately of sales and class heavy duty truck production approximately of sales 
vehicle builds have ranged from million to million over the last several years 
calendar vehicle builds are expected to be some million 
the segment experienced excellent customer demand in  particularly in the first half of the year  when demand for the segment s engineered steel bar products outstripped our ability to fully supply customers 
the segment also benefited from higher base selling prices and falling steel scrap costs for much of the year 
the following table sets forth selected operating data for the vehicular products segment years ended october  change dollars in millions vs 
vs 
net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income operating income margin all periods presented exclude piper impact and temroc  which are included in discontinued operations 
fiscal includes macsteel monroe s operations as of january  net sales for fiscal were higher than fiscal by due to the combination of a increase in average selling prices including surcharges  increased sales as a result of two additional months of business at macsteel monroe during fiscal  offset by a decline in volume excluding macsteel monroe 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal is made up of a increase as a result of the macsteel monroe acquisition coupled with an increase in volume and a increase in average prices including surcharges 
fiscal volumes dropped from the strong levels that had persisted for several years primarily as a result of reduced end use demand and inventory drawdowns 
over time  end use demand is expected to increase  influenced  in part  to overall driver aged population growth 
the company continues to focus on consistently improving productivity as well as enhancing its value added offerings in an effort to meet the anticipated higher demand over time 
future volume increases will also be based upon the company s ability to increase content per vehicle as well as continued sales growth with the new american manufacturers nams which continue to take share from the big manufacturers 
the average price increases realized over the last three years are primarily the result of three items 
first  the company is focused on continuing to increase sales of the segment s value added products 
as the mix of value added sales increases  so does the average sales price 
the second contributing factor to the average price increases are underlying base price increases that were realized in the largest contributing factor for the increase from fiscal to and from fiscal to is the overall price increases from higher steel scrap surcharges 
steel scrap prices increased dramatically over the latter half of calendar and all of fiscal as a result of the steel scrap price increases  surcharges began on january  and have been adjusted quarterly since then see further discussion of surcharge lag in commodity price risk of item a 
steel scrap price surcharges have been a component of the company s macsteel sales contracts for many years and will remain in effect as long as steel scrap prices remain at current levels 
the and increases in operating income from fiscal to and fiscal to  respectively  resulted from the increases in average selling prices offset by higher raw material costs 
at macsteel  average selling prices increased as raw material costs fell during fiscal  whereas in fiscal raw material costs increased more than average selling prices 
volume increases in fiscal were able to offset the higher raw material price increases 
raw material costs increased significantly during fiscal during fiscal raw material costs steadily declined for the first three fiscal quarters followed by an increase during the fiscal fourth quarter 
fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were higher primarily due to increased incentives resulting from the improved return on net assets rona level achieved for the year coupled with a million increase in the reserve for doubtful accounts receivable due to jernberg industries  inc and delphi  which filed for bankruptcy during the year 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily related to the addition of macsteel monroe 
operating income margin variation from fiscal to and was greatly impacted by the dramatic rise and fall of raw material prices and the timing and magnitude of scrap surcharges 
raw material prices increased sharply throughout fiscal which compressed the segment s margins  while in fiscal raw material prices declined during the first three quarters of the year 
as raw material prices rise  the company experiences short term compression of the operating margin since the surcharges are adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon raw material indexes from the previous three months 
as raw material prices level off  the company would expect the vehicular products segment s operating income margin to improve initially 
declines in raw material costs will increase the margin in the short term as the surcharge reductions lag behind 
based upon the inherent lag of surcharge pricing  the company s margins were compressed during fiscal and expanded during fiscal the operating income margins realized during fiscal are not sustainable over the long term 
in fact  margins experienced compression during the latter months of the company s fiscal building products three years ended october  the building products segment reported record net sales and operating income in fiscal the segment s primary market drivers are north american new housing starts and remodeling activity  and both drivers continue to perform at high levels 
for example  new housing starts are expected to exceed million for calendar year  a best ever year 
the building products segment s process business  nichols aluminum  benefited from higher selling prices and very robust demand  particularly in the first half of the year  when customer demand for the segment s mill finished and painted sheet outstripped our ability to supply 
the segment s window and door components business benefited from both healthy demand through the year and the addition of mikron industries  a leading supplier of vinyl window profiles  which was acquired in december the business was negatively impacted late in the fiscal year from a sharp rise in the cost of raw materials at its mikron and truseal businesses  the result of hurricane katrina and its impact on major suppliers located along the gulf coast 
the following table sets forth selected operating data for the building products segment years ended october  change dollars in millions vs 
vs 
net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income operating income margin all periods presented exclude nichols aluminum golden which is included in discontinued operations 
fiscal includes mikron s operations as of december  fiscal and include truseal s operations as of january  the fiscal net sales increase resulted from a increase from the acquisition of mikron and a increase at the other businesses within the segment 
the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal was comprised of a increase from the acquisition of truseal and a increase at the other businesses within the segment 
the increase in net sales over the three year period was a result of increased volumes across the entire segment during fiscal combined with a and increase in aluminum sheet selling prices for and  respectively 
the volume increase in fiscal was driven by strong demand in the building products market and new programs with fenestration customers 
volume in fiscal declined slightly due to inventory drawdowns of aluminum sheet that resulted from prebuying that occurred early in the year 
fenestration component sales remained robust as a result of increased housing starts as well as strong remodeling and renovation activity 
fiscal housing starts were also fueled by relatively low mortgage rates 
mortgage rates are increasing and expected to rise further during fiscal  which could slow the pace of housing starts 
the segment is expected to benefit from continued steady demand from remodeling and renovation activity which comprises an estimated of the segment s sales 
the company is focused on working closely with customers to be a part of their new product development which is an important component to increasing revenue 
generally  demographics for long term housing demand are favorable when factoring the population increase  immigration and an increase in vacation homes 
these coupled with an increase in the average sized home should benefit the segment over the long term 
furthermore  the company s presence in the vinyl and composite window market  which represents the fastest growing window segment  should continue to fuel growth 
the increased aluminum sheet selling prices during fiscal and was a result of reduced industry capacity which combined with strong demand during fiscal and the first half of to put upward pressure on pricing 
the company continues to increase the mix of value added products across the segment which should mitigate the expected margin pressure due to moderation in demand 
excluding mikron  net sales increased in fiscal compared to a increase in cost of sales 
the spread between the company s selling price and raw material price expanded in fiscal over fiscal even with the rise in raw material costs 
this increase in spread was the primary contributor to the increase in operating income from in fiscal to in fiscal the increased spread was partially offset by more incentives from higher rona levels 
operating income for fiscal increased from the acquisition of truseal and primarily due to margin expansion 
during fiscal demand increased such that the upward price pressure realized in the market was able to stay ahead of the increasing raw material costs 
the associated margin expansion realized during fiscal coupled with volume increases resulted in further expansion of the operating income margin 
while the spreads realized during fiscal are not expected to continue  the spreads are anticipated to remain at more favorable levels than had been realized historically 
corporate and other three years ended october  years ended october  change dollars in millions vs 
vs 
cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization gain on sale of land operating income expense corporate and other operating expenses  not included in the two operating segments mentioned above  include the consolidated lifo inventory adjustments calculated on a combined pool basis and corporate office expenses 
as a result of raw material cost increases during fiscal and fiscal  the company incurred expense of million and million in the form of a lifo inventory adjustment 
the pool of average raw material costs was only slightly lower at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal and as a result the company recognized million of income due to the reduction of the lifo inventory adjustment 
fluctuations associated with the lifo inventory adjustment tend to comprise a majority of the change from year to year in corporate and other expenses 
for the year ended october   the company incurred million of external consulting fees and external audit fees associated with the sarbanes oxley act 
other items three years ended october  interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase from to is a result of an increase in the average debt outstanding for the comparative period that is primarily attributable to the acquisitions that were completed in the first quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal the company borrowed against the revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of mikron 
the borrowings and subsequent debt repayment followed a similar pattern to what occurred in the difference in interest expense is related to a full year of interest on the company s convertible senior debentures combined with higher interest rates incurred during fiscal other  net on the income statement for fiscal was income of million compared to income of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the change from to is due to a million reduction associated with the cash surrender value of life insurance  net of the change for the supplemental retirement liability  combined with million of additional expenses recognized in fiscal for deferred compensation 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes for fiscal was a loss of million compared to a loss of million for fiscal and a loss of million for fiscal the increased loss from fiscal to fiscal is related to the million loss on the sale of nichols aluminum golden  combined with the net million write down of piper impact 
during fiscal  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge for temroc of million 
the temroc impairment combined with an additional loss on the sale of piper impact comprised the difference between fiscal and fiscal see note for further information regarding the composition of discontinued operations 
outlook for  north american light vehicle builds for the calendar year are expected to be about million units  down slightly from s estimated million units 
big light vehicle builds are expected to be down  roughly offset by an increase in builds at the transplant companies 
the company s market response to a fall off in builds is to continue to increase our content per vehicle with both the big and the transplants 
one major area of content growth lies within the conversion of automotive crankshafts from a cast iron product to a steel application  which represents a  ton opportunity 
in  the company produced approximately  tons of bars for crankshaft applications  and for  the company expects that tonnage to reach  tons 
the production of heavy duty trucks is expected to remain quite strong in  with builds topping  as manufacturers attempt to beat the deadline for new epa emission mandates for class engines 
for fiscal  the company believes that the bulk of the industry wide steel inventory drawdowns are behind us 
the significant production cutbacks the company experienced over the last couple of quarters of fiscal seem to be over  which should result in our bar production being more in line with normalized demand 
looking at the first quarter  macsteel has seen a recent up tick in customer activity and the plants today are collectively running at about capacity 
in addition  the pace is expected to pick up after the holidays based on the current backlog 
in the building products segment  both housing starts and remodeling activity are expected to remain at historically high levels 
for  housing starts hovered around million units  which will make it the best year ever 
for  the company is expecting a modest slowdown  but is looking for starts to stay around million while remodeling activity is expected to remain at high levels 
the segment will also benefit this year from both lower costs and higher sales associated with our relatively new hood river and dubuque fenestration facilities 
expectations for the mikron business and the vinyl window market they serve appear excellent 
the company expects the vinyl window market to experience growth approaching for the new construction market and closer to for the remodeling market 
the company believes that the outlook for nichols aluminum remains favorable as well 
supply and demand fundamentals have shifted considerably over the last year as the industry experienced mergers  downsizing and price increases  and we will continue to benefit from that transition 
near term  the company does expect shipments to trail year ago figures as customers continue to work off high inventories 
given these sound fundamentals  an end to the sharp spike in raw material costs experienced this year  some catch up in pricing  and the growth the company expects to see from its vinyl window profile sales  the company believes will be a better year for our fenestration business 
in fact  quanex expects to substantially outperform the market with growth exceeding combining the anticipated operating results of the two operating segments  quanex expects to report diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal in a range of to 
the company cautions that its combination of short cycle businesses and volatile raw material costs  particularly for scrap  makes forecasting problematic 
for the first quarter of  both macsteel and nichols aluminum were running at unsustainably high operating rates  they were aggressively raising prices  their customers were on allocation and their backlogs were at record levels 
adding to these positive factors was that macsteel was experiencing a significant over recovery on their actual scrap costs in the first quarter of as well 
these factors combined to give the company a huge first quarter in  with earnings over times higher than the first quarter of  along with record net sales and record income from continuing operations 
unfortunately  these earnings cannot reasonably be duplicated in what looks to be a much more normal first quarter of at this time  quanex is not providing annual guidance for the company is still finalizing contract talks with its customers at macsteel  the volatility of steel scrap continues  and the company wants to experience the volume rebound for aluminum sheet it expects to see after the holiday 
for these reasons  the company expects to give guidance when it announces first quarter results in february in the meantime  the company s first quarter guidance cannot be multiplied by four to estimate the full fiscal year as there is considerable seasonality to the company s earnings 
in recent years  first quarter earnings have typically been approximately of the company s annual earnings per share 
liquidity and capital resources sources of funds the company s principal sources of funds are cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under its secured million revolving credit agreement bank agreement 
on december   the company executed an agreement with our credit facility banks to increase the bank agreement from million to million to provide the funds necessary for acquisitions 
on april   the company requested and received consent from its credit facility bank group to extend the maturity date of the bank agreement from november   to february  in december  the company borrowed million under the bank agreement to fund the acquisition of mikron 
since then  the company has paid off all million of the borrowings 
at october   the company had no borrowings under the bank agreement and million outstanding senior convertible debentures due may  the debentures 
this represents no change from october   borrowing levels 
the aggregate availability under the bank agreement was million at october   which is net of million of outstanding letters of credit 
the company believes that it has sufficient funds and adequate financial resources available to meet its anticipated liquidity needs 
the company also believes that cash flow from operations  cash balances and available borrowings will be sufficient in the foreseeable future to finance anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  environmental expenditures  dividends and the stock buyback program 
the company s working capital was million on october  compared to million on october   a million reduction 
excluding the impact of the acquisitions and the impact of discontinued operations  working capital increased million from october   to october  the most significant changes were a million reduction in accounts receivable and a million reduction in accounts payable 
accounts receivable declined because of two items 
the accounts receivable balance as of october  represented fewer days of sales outstanding than the balance as of october   which accounts for million of the reduction  with million attributable to the vehicular products segment 
the remaining difference is a result of the fact that net sales for the fourth quarter of were lower than net sales in the fourth quarter of  excluding the acquisitions 
the reduction in accounts payable is directly related to lower raw material prices coupled with lower purchase volumes across both segments 
the cash and equivalents balance increased million to million as the company ended fiscal with nothing outstanding under the bank agreement 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities during the year ended october  was million compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the million increase in operating cash flows from fiscal to is primarily attributable to the million increase in income from continuing operations 
similarly  the increase of million from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to the million increase in income from continuing operations 
accounts receivable and accounts payable decreased in fiscal as a result of the weaker demand experienced during the year 
accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable were impacted significantly by the increase in raw material prices experienced throughout fiscal and while the run up in raw material costs increased inventory prices  the company was successful in reducing overall inventory volumes  which helped to keep total working capital in line with the previous year 
the company continues to focus on working capital consistent with improving its business processes 
investment activities net cash used for investment activities during the year ended october  was million compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
investment activities for the year ended october  included the acquisition of mikron and besten for million 
the cost of the acquisitions was partially offset by the million received from the sale of piper impact as well as proceeds received as a working capital adjustment from the sale of nichols aluminum golden 
the company expects to receive proceeds from the sale of temroc in fiscal see note for further explanation 
capital expenditures increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal of this increase  million is attributable to the expansion of value added capabilities and caster upgrades within the company s vehicular products segment phase viii and phase ix expansions at macsteel 
in addition  mikron s capital spending totaled million for capacity expansion 
capital expenditures had been relatively steady in previous years at million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company expects capital expenditures to increase to range from approximately million to million as both macsteel and mikron continue with their respective expansions 
at october   the company had commitments of approximately million for the purchase or construction of capital assets 
the company plans to fund these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
financing activities cash from financing activities was a million use of cash  a million source of cash and a million use of cash for the years ended october   and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company borrowed approximately million to fund the acquisition of mikron 
by the end of fiscal  all million had been repaid 
the amount of dividends paid was offset by the amount of cash received associated with the issuance of stock upon exercise of stock options 
during fiscal  the primary reason for the source was the issuance of the debentures 
fiscal resulted in a use of cash as the company repaid bank borrowings and repurchased some of the company s common stock 
debt structure and activity refer to note long term debt and financing arrangements for a discussion of the company s debt structure 
stock purchase program on august   the board of directors authorized the company to reload its stock buy back program  increasing the existing authorization up to million shares 
during fiscal  the company may purchase shares  from time to time  on the open market or in negotiated transactions  as circumstances warrant  depending upon market conditions and other factors 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual cash obligations the following tables set forth certain information concerning the company s unconditional obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts with remaining terms in excess of one year  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments 
payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt  including interest operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the long term debt is primarily comprised of the million of debentures due in and million of various revenue bonds 
the debenture obligation is based on the stated maturity  and the debt interest amounts are based on rates as of october  operating leases cover a range of items from facilities  fork trucks and cars to fax machines and other miscellaneous equipment 
the unconditional purchase obligations are made up of million of natural gas contracts and million of aluminum scrap contracts along with other miscellaneous repair and maintenance items 
other commercial commitments the following table reflects other commercial commitments or potential cash outflows that may result from a contingent event  such as a need to borrow short term funds for liquidity purposes 
amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year years years more than years in thousands standby letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in the rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on earnings and other financial statement items 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information becomes available and as the company s operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from estimates 
the company believes the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue when the products are shipped and the title and risk of ownership pass to the customer 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual agreements 
inherent in the company s revenue recognition policy is the determination of collectibility 
this requires management to make frequent judgments and estimates in order to determine the appropriate amount of allowance needed for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to accounts receivable 
this allowance is maintained at a level the company considers appropriate based on historical and other factors that affect collectibility 
these factors include historical trends of write offs  recoveries and credit losses  the careful monitoring of portfolio credit quality  and projected economic and market conditions 
different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance 
inventory the company records inventory valued at the lower of cost or market value 
inventories are valued using both the first in first out fifo and last in  first out lifo methods 
the company adopted the link chain lifo method in fiscal since then  acquisitions were integrated into the company s operations with some valuing inventories on a lifo basis and others on a fifo basis 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the company s forecast of future demand and market conditions 
significant unanticipated changes to the company s forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory 
environmental contingencies quanex is subject to extensive laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment and the remediation of chemical contamination 
to satisfy such requirements  quanex must make capital and other expenditures on an ongoing basis 
the company accrues its best estimates of its remediation obligations and adjusts such accruals as further information and circumstances develop 
those estimates may change substantially depending on information about the nature and extent of contamination  appropriate remediation technologies  and regulatory approvals 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to their present value  unless the amount and timing of the expenditures are fixed or reliably determinable 
when environmental laws might be deemed to impose joint and several liability for the costs of responding to contamination  the company accrues its allocable share of liability taking into account the number of parties participating  their ability to pay their shares  the volumes and nature of the wastes involved  the nature of anticipated response actions  and the nature of the company s alleged connections 
unanticipated changes in circumstances and or legal requirements could result in expenses being incurred in future periods in addition to an increase in actual cash required to remediate the contamination 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment and intangibles the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  other intangibles  and other assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment and further reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may be impaired 
the carrying values are compared with the fair value of such assets calculated based on the anticipated future cash flows related to those assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which such review is performed 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and future market conditions 
future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
goodwill the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
the company performs a goodwill impairment test annually as of august in addition  goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists 
the impairment test requires the company to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value including assigned goodwill 
the company primarily uses the present value of future cash flows to determine fair value and validates the result against the cost and market approaches 
future cash flows are typically based upon a five year future period for the businesses and an estimated residual value 
management judgment is required in the estimation of future operating results and to determine the appropriate residual values 
the residual values are determined from comparable industry transactions 
future operating results and residual values could reasonably differ from the estimates and could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
income taxes the company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the company s consolidated balance sheet  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax liability reflects the company s assumption that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize its deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets 
this could result in additional income tax expense in a future period in the consolidated statement of income 
retirement and pension plans the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded postretirement plan that provides health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate  which is determined using a model that matches corporate bond securities  is applied against the projected pension and postretirement disbursements 
actual pension plan asset investment performance will either reduce or increase unamortized pension losses at the end of any fiscal year  which ultimately affects future pension costs 
the effects of the decrease in selected assumptions  assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for the pension plans in fiscal  is shown below effect on all defined benefit pension plans october  assumption percentage point change increase decrease in projected benefit obligation increase decrease in pension expense in thousands discount rate pts assumed return on plan assets pts n a accounting guidance applicable to pensions does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience and the revision of an estimate 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss in the footnotes 
at october  and  there were unrecognized losses of million and million  respectively 
a portion of the loss will be amortized in fiscal year the effect on fiscal years after will depend on the actual experience of the plans 
postretirement plan assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgments regarding future expectations 
assumed health care cost trend rates could have an effect on the amounts reported for post retirement benefit plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects one percent increase one percent decrease in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation mortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are related to the experience of the plans and to our third party actuary s best estimate of expected plan mortality 
the mortality assumptions for fiscal valuation purposes will be based on different mortality tables 
the selected mortality tables for fiscal are among the most recent tables available 
the effect of the change is expected to increase the projected benefit obligation and pension expense for fiscal by approximately million and million  respectively 
discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas the company presents the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of operations that have either been sold or that meet the criteria for held for sale accounting as discontinued operations 
at the time an operation qualifies for held for sale accounting  the operation is evaluated to determine whether or not the carrying value exceeds its fair value less cost to sell 
any loss as a result of carrying value in excess of fair value less cost to sell is recorded in the period the operation meets held for sale accounting 
management judgment is required to assess the criteria required to meet held for sale accounting  and estimate fair value 
changes to the operation could cause it to no longer qualify for held for sale accounting and changes to fair value could result in an increase or decrease to previously recognized losses 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of sfas r are effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after june  the company will adopt this standard at the beginning of fiscal and will elect the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
awards that are granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas except that stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the income statement 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted in the future  the market value of the company s common stock as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s stock price  volatility  and employee stock option exercise behaviors and the related tax impact
