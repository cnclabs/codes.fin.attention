item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general frontier operates the refineries in cheyenne  wyoming and el dorado  kansas as previously discussed in part i  item of this form k 
we focus our marketing efforts in the rocky mountain and plains states regions of the united states 
we purchase the crude oil to be refined and market the refined petroleum products produced  including various grades of gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel  asphalt and other by products 
results of operations to assist in understanding our operating results  please refer to the operating data in part i  item of this form k  which provides key operating information for our combined refineries 
data for each refinery is included in part i  item of this form k  our quarterly reports on form q and on our web site address http www

com 
the three significant indicators of our profitability reflected in the operating data of the analysis referred to above are the gasoline and diesel crack spreads  the light heavy crude oil differential and the wti wts crude oil differential 
other significant factors that influence our results are refinery utilization  crude oil price trends  asphalt and by product margins and refinery operating expenses including natural gas prices and turnaround  or planned maintenance activity 
we typically do not use derivative instruments to offset price risk on our base level of operating inventories 
under our fifo inventory accounting method  crude oil price trends can cause significant fluctuation in the inventory valuation of our crude oil  unfinished products and finished products resulting in fifo inventory gains when crude oil prices increase and fifo inventory losses when crude oil prices decrease during the reporting period 
see price risk management activities under item a for a discussion of our utilization of derivative contracts 
the price of crude oil on the new york mercantile exchange was very volatile during the price began the year at per barrel  reached a yearly high of per barrel in october  and then declined to per barrel by december  the price of crude oil increased during as the oil market supply demand fundamentals continued to support higher prices 
demand for crude oil continued to increase throughout the world in  especially in china  because of improved economic growth 
excess supply capability within both opec and non opec countries has declined significantly in recent years 
industry experts estimate that excess supply capacity for opec is currently less than million bpd compared to estimated world oil demand of nearly million bpd in these factors  along with others such as geopolitical risk  have resulted in higher oil prices and opec s increased ability to manage prices 
the increase in crude oil prices  along with additional crude oil production in being primarily heavy and or sour crude oil  increased our crude oil differentials during in the us  gasoline demand increased approximately  bpd  or  in production of gasoline in the us and imports of gasoline into the us were required to comply with the new low sulfur gasoline requirements  and production was reduced by the elimination of mtbe blending in major markets 
at times during  production was unable to meet supply  thereby resulting in low levels of gasoline inventories during the driving season 
these factors led to higher spring and summer gasoline crack spreads than we had received in prior years 
diesel crack spreads improved later in the year  as diesel inventories were below five year averages entering the heating oil season 
we believe that many of the market fundamentals that caused higher crude oil prices and wider crude oil differentials in will continue into although we believe that gasoline and diesel crack spreads will remain attractive because of increasing demand  they may not meet or exceed gasoline and diesel crack spreads due to higher inventories of gasoline entering the spring and summer driving seasons of and less planned turnaround activity in the industry in early compared to the same period in compared with overview of results we had net income for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the same period in our operating income of million for the year ended december  was an increase of million from the million operating income for the comparable period in the average diesel crack spread was significantly higher during per barrel than in per barrel 
the average gasoline crack spread was also higher during per barrel than in per barrel  and both the light heavy and wti wts crude oil differentials improved 
our net income for the year ended december  was reduced by million pretax million after tax in additional costs associated with the redemption of our senior notes 
we used available cash and proceeds from a new million senior notes offering to redeem the senior notes 
this refinancing will reduce interest expense in future years by million per year 
our net income for the year ended december  was also reduced by the legal costs associated with the termination of the holly merger and the beverly hills litigation 
on march   we announced that we had entered into an agreement with holly pursuant to which the two companies would merge 
on august   we announced that holly had advised us that it was not willing to proceed with our merger agreement on the agreed terms 
as a result  we filed suit against holly for damages in delaware 
merger termination and legal costs reduced earnings in the year ended december  by million pretax million after tax  and costs related to the beverly hills litigation reduced earnings in the year ended december  by an additional million pretax million after tax 
our net income for the year ended december  was increased by million pretax million after tax from the gain on involuntary conversion of assets related to the fire that occurred on january  in the furnaces of the cheyenne refinery coker 
specific variances refined product revenues increased million  or  from billion to billion for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was due to increased sales prices higher average per sales barrel  and slightly higher sales volumes in more bpd 
sales prices increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil prices and net improvements in the gasoline and diesel crack spreads 
average gasoline prices increased from per sales barrel in to per sales barrel in sales volumes of gasoline increased from  bpd in to  bpd in average diesel and jet fuel prices increased from per sales barrel in to per sales barrel during however  sales volumes of diesel and jet fuel decreased bpd from  bpd during the year ended december  to  bpd during the same period in total product sales volumes overall increased only slightly from  bpd in the year ended december  to  bpd in the same period in yields of gasoline decreased bpd  or less than  from  bpd in the year ended december  to  bpd in the same period in yields of diesel and jet fuel remained fairly flat year to year  decreasing only bpd  from  bpd in the year ended december  to  bpd in the same period in yields for the year ended december  for the el dorado refinery were nearly flat  increasing just bpd from the year ended december  yields for the year ended december  for the cheyenne refinery were lower than in the same period in primarily because of the coker furnace fire see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the cheyenne refinery coking unit was out of service for one month in the first quarter of other revenues decreased million to a million loss for the year ended december  compared to income of nearly million for the same period in due to million in net losses from derivative contracts accounted for using mark to market accounting in the year ended december   compared to net losses of  for the same period in see price risk management activities under item a for a discussion of our utilization of commodity derivative contracts 
processing income from our cheyenne refinery coker was  less during the year ended december   compared to the same period in due to the july conclusion of the long term resid processing agreement with suncor energy usa inc suncor  and the coker being out of service for a portion of from the previously mentioned fire 
the processing agreement entitled suncor to process in the cheyenne refinery coker up to  bpd of resid  a heavy end by product of the refining process 
raw material  freight and other costs include crude oil and other raw materials used in the refining process  purchased products and blendstocks  freight costs for fob destination sales  as well as the impact of changes in inventory under the fifo inventory accounting method 
the average price of crude oil was higher in the year ended december  than in the same period in the average price of wti crude oil priced at cushing  oklahoma was per barrel in the year ended december  compared to per barrel in the same period in raw material  freight and other costs increased by million  or per sales barrel  during the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the increase in raw material  freight and other costs was due to higher average crude prices and more crude oil charges  offset by higher inventory gains from rising prices in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we also benefited from improved crude oil differentials during the year ended december  when compared to the same period in for the year ended december   we realized a reduction in raw material  freight and other costs as a result of inventory gains of approximately million after tax million pretax  comprised of million at the cheyenne refinery and million at the el dorado refinery because of increasing crude oil and refined product prices 
for the year ended december   we realized a reduction in raw material  freight and other costs as a result of inventory gains of approximately million after tax million pretax  comprised of a million gain for the el dorado refinery and a million gain for the cheyenne refinery 
the cheyenne refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  increased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to higher crude oil prices offset by higher inventory gains and an improved light heavy crude oil differential 
the heavy crude oil utilization rate at the cheyenne refinery expressed as a percentage of the total crude oil charge decreased to in the year ended december  from in  as we processed more light crude oil due to the coker being out of service for approximately one month 
the light heavy crude oil differential for the cheyenne refinery averaged per barrel in the year ended december  compared to per barrel in the same period in the el dorado refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel for the year ended december  increased from per sales barrel in the same period in due to higher average crude oil prices offset by higher inventory gains and an improved wti wts crude oil differential 
the wti wts crude oil differential increased from an average of per barrel in the year ended december  to per barrel in the same period in refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  include both the variable costs energy and utilities and the fixed costs salaries  taxes  maintenance costs and other of operating the refineries 
refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million  or per sales barrel  in the year ended december  compared to million  or per sales barrel  in the comparable period of the cheyenne refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million  or per sales barrel  in the year ended december  compared to million  or per sales barrel  in the comparable period of the increased expenses included higher costs in natural gas million  maintenance million  salaries million  a bonus accrual million and increased environmental expenses million 
the higher natural gas costs resulted primarily from an average increase in price of per mmbtu  along with also utilizing approximately more volumes of natural gas during the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the el dorado refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million  or per sales barrel  in the year ended december   increasing from million  or per sales barrel  for the year ended december  primarily due to higher costs in natural gas million  a bonus accrual million and higher salaries and benefits million  offset by reduced costs in consulting and legal million 
the higher natural gas costs resulted primarily from an average increase in price of per mmbtu  along with also utilizing approximately more volumes of natural gas during the year ended december  when compared to the same period in selling and general expenses  excluding depreciation  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to increased costs related to the beverly hills litigation and increases in salaries 
costs related to the beverly hills litigation during the year ended december  were million million in legal costs  substantially all of which have been paid or will be paid from the commutation account  and million amortization of the previously purchased loss mitigation insurance premium  as opposed to million in the same period in salaries increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to million in bonuses being accrued in  while none were accrued in merger termination and legal costs of million for the year ended december  include legal costs associated with the termination of the anticipated holly merger and resulting lawsuit  compared to million in merger termination and legal costs for the comparable period in depreciation and amortization increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in because of increased capital investment in our refineries 
interest expense and other financing costs of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the comparable period in interest expense and other financing costs for the year ended december  included million in costs related to the redemption of our senior notes and subsequent reduced interest expense on our new million senior note debt issuance 
this refinancing will reduce interest expense in future years by million per year 
the million in redemption related costs includes million of premium  the write off at redemption of the remaining unamortized million of issue discount  million for the write off at redemption of the remaining unamortized debt issue costs  and million of legal and administrative costs to facilitate the tender offer and redemption 
we also had no interest on the senior notes during the year ended december   as they were redeemed in december million in interest expense for the year ended december  
interest expense and other financing costs for the year ended december  also included million of premium paid upon redemption of our senior notes in december average debt outstanding decreased to million during the year ended december  from million excluding merger debt for the same period in capitalized interest  which reduced interest expense and other financing costs  was  during the year ended december  compared to  in the comparable period of interest income increased  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   as we had more cash available to invest 
the gain on involuntary conversion of assets relates to the fire that occurred on january  in the furnaces of the coking unit at the cheyenne refinery 
for the year ended december   the gain represents the settlement proceeds of million from our insurers less million of expenses related to clean up costs and million of net property  plant and equipment written off due to the fire 
the merger financing termination costs  net  during the year ended december  were million  which related to the senior notes issued to finance the contemplated holly merger and included interest expense  issue discount  financing issue costs and redemption premium  net of  interest income earned on the escrow account 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million on pretax income of million or reflecting the net benefit of releasing our deferred tax valuation allowance offset by the effect of the permanent book versus tax differences and prior year adjustments from our current estimated effective tax rate of 
as of december   we have no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on our deferred tax assets 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million on pretax income of million or due to one time adjustments for permanent book versus tax differences related to and expenses and an increase of  in the income tax provision for the year ended december  resulting from an adjustment to the tax provision 
the new american jobs creation act of the act provision providing tax relief for manufacturers should result in reduced effective federal income tax rates beginning in in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb staff issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas to provide guidance on the application of fas to the provision within the act that provides tax relief to us domestic manufacturers 
the fsp states that the manufacturers deduction set forth in the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with fas and not as a tax rate reduction 
a special deduction is accounted for by recording the benefit of the deduction in the year in which it can be taken in our tax return  and not by adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of the act s enactment 
the fsp was effective upon issuance  and we have properly accounted for our deferred taxes at december  in accordance with the fsp 
other certain provisions of the act should benefit frontier by allowing us an accelerated depreciation deduction of of qualified capital costs incurred to achieve low sulfur diesel fuel requirements and by providing a per gallon credit on compliant diesel fuel up to an amount equal to the remaining of these qualified capital costs for federal income tax purposes 
see environmental under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
compared with overview of results we had net income for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for our net income was negatively impacted by the termination of the holly merger 
merger termination and legal costs and merger termination financing costs  net of interest income  reduced earnings by million pretax million after tax 
the merger related costs were on an accrual basis and did not include bank facility charges related to the merger 
despite the negative impact of the terminated holly merger  our operating income of million for increased million from million for the major factors improving operating income were improved gasoline and diesel crack spreads  increases in the light heavy crude oil differential and wti wts crude oil differential and improved yields and sales from our cheyenne refinery 
yields and sales were down in at our el dorado refinery due to a major crude unit turnaround  or planned maintenance  in the spring of results were also negatively impacted by higher refinery operating expenses at both refineries  primarily due to higher natural gas costs 
specific variances refined product revenues increased million  or  from billion to billion for the year ended december  compared to due to increased sales prices resulting from higher crude oil prices and higher gasoline and diesel crack spreads on nearly flat sales volumes 
our gasoline and diesel crack spreads averaged per barrel and per barrel  respectively  in  compared to per barrel and per barrel  respectively  in average gasoline prices increased from per sales barrel in to per sales barrel in sales volumes of gasoline decreased  bpd from  bpd during to  bpd in average diesel and jet fuel prices increased from per sales barrel in to per sales barrel during sales volumes of diesel and jet fuel increased bpd from  bpd during to  bpd in total product sales volumes overall decreased less than from  bpd in to  bpd in yields of gasoline decreased  bpd  or  from  bpd in to  bpd in  and yields of diesel and jet fuel decreased bpd  or less than  from  bpd in compared to  bpd in sales and yield volumes for for the el dorado refinery were lower than during primarily because of the crude unit turnaround at the el dorado refinery  which commenced on march  and was completed on march  during the first quarter of  the el dorado refinery s charge and yield volumes were  bpd and  bpd less respectively  than the first quarter of  however upon completion of the turnaround  the el dorado refinery operations were very strong during the remainder of  ending the year at only  fewer bpd of charges and  fewer bpd of yields than the cheyenne refinery operations were very strong all year resulting in both increased charge and yield volumes sufficient to offset the reduced charges and yields at the el dorado refinery resulting in aggregate small increases in charge volumes of  bpd and yield volumes of bpd 
other revenues decreased  to  for the year ended december  compared to revenues of million for the same period in due to  in net losses from derivative contracts accounted for using mark to market accounting in the year ended december   compared to net income of  for the same period in see price risk management activities in item a  offset by increased processing income from our cheyenne refinery coker 
the average price of crude oil was substantially higher in than in the average price of wti crude oil priced at cushing  oklahoma was per barrel in compared to per barrel in raw material  freight and other costs increased million  or per sales barrel  from due to higher average crude oil prices and a smaller amount of inventory gains from rising prices during than during  offset by improved crude oil spreads 
for the year ended december   we realized a decrease in raw material  freight and other costs as a result of inventory gains of approximately million after tax million pretax  comprised of million at the cheyenne refinery and million at the el dorado refinery because of the increasing crude oil prices 
the price of crude oil on the new york mercantile exchange was very volatile in the crude price began the year at per barrel  reached a high of per barrel in march  dropped to a low of per barrel in april and closed the year at per barrel 
for the year ended december   we realized a decrease in raw material  freight and other costs as a result of inventory gains of approximately million after tax million pretax  comprised of million at the cheyenne refinery and million at the el dorado refinery because of increasing crude oil prices 
the price of crude oil on the new york mercantile exchange increased during from per barrel to per barrel by year end 
the cheyenne refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel in increased from per sales barrel in due to higher crude oil prices and less inventory gains  offset by an improved light heavy crude oil differential 
the heavy crude oil utilization rate at the cheyenne refinery expressed as a percentage of the total crude oil charge decreased to in from in  as we utilized slightly more light crude oil 
the light heavy crude oil differential for the cheyenne refinery averaged per barrel in compared to per barrel in the el dorado refinery raw material  freight and other costs of per sales barrel in increased from per sales barrel in due to higher average crude oil prices and less inventory gains  offset by an improved wti wts crude oil differential 
the wti wts crude oil differential increased from an average of per barrel in to per barrel in refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation  were million  or per sales barrel  in compared to million  or per sales barrel  in the cheyenne refinery operating expense  excluding depreciation  was million  or per sales barrel  in compared to million  or per sales barrel  in primarily due to higher natural gas and other utility costs million  salaries million  consulting and legal  and additives and chemicals 
the el dorado refinery operating expense  excluding depreciation  was million  or per sales barrel  in  increasing from million  or per sales barrel  in primarily due to higher natural gas costs million  salaries million  chemicals million and excess turnaround costs million 
the per barrel refinery operating expense variance was exacerbated by lower sales volumes in than in selling and general expenses  excluding depreciation  increased million  or  for the year ended december  because of million in legal costs related to the beverly hills lawsuits  increases in other legal costs and salaries  and travel  engineering and other consulting services related to evaluating potential acquisitions and possible refinery improvements 
merger termination and legal costs of million for the year ended december  included transaction and ongoing legal costs on an accrual basis associated with the termination of the anticipated merger and resulting lawsuit with holly 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to because of increases in capital investment at our refineries 
the interest expense and other financing costs excluding costs relating to the senior notes issued and redeemed in connection with the terminated holly merger of million for increased million from million in primarily due to the premium of million paid upon redemption of our senior notes in december average debt outstanding excluding the senior notes decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest income excluding interest income earned on the senior notes escrow account decreased  from million in to million in due to less cash available to invest and lower interest rates 
the merger financing termination costs  net were million and included interest expense  issue discount  financing issue costs and a redemption premium  net of  interest income earned on the escrow account  related to the million principal senior notes 
these costs did not include bank facility charges related to the merger 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million on pretax income of million or due to one time adjustments for permanent book versus tax differences related to and expenses and an increase of  in the income tax provision for resulting from a true up of the tax provision 
our current estimated effective tax rate was 
our effective income tax rate for the book provision of income taxes for the year ended december  of was also greater than our estimated statutory rate due to one time adjustments for permanent book versus tax differences and an increase in the state deferred income tax provision due to a revised estimate of state apportionment factors based on actual allocation factor data 
an  canadian income tax payment for an audit settlement related to our canadian oil and gas operations sold in june also increased our income tax provision in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  compared to net cash used by operating activities of million during the year ended december  our improved result of operations was the largest contributor to improved cash flow  along with working capital changes 
working capital changes provided a total of million of cash flows in the year ended december  while using million of cash flows in the comparable period in the most significant provider of cash for working capital changes during the year ended december  was the increase in accounts payable of million and the increase in accrued liabilities and other of million compared to a decrease in accounts payable of million and an increase in accrued liabilities and other of only million in the comparable period 
the increase in accounts payable was due to the significant increase in crude oil prices during the increase in accrued liabilities and other was primarily due to million for bonuses accrued as of december   which were based on operating results and will be paid during the first quarter of  compared to no accrued bonuses as of december  the most significant working capital item offsetting the positive cash flow impacts during the year ended december  was an increase in inventories  which utilized cash of million in the period 
this was due to higher crude oil prices and resulting higher product prices 
during the year ended december   we made net estimated federal and state income tax payments of approximately million million payments  net of a federal tax refund received of million 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  working capital of million and million of borrowing base availability for additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have a board of director approved stock repurchase program to repurchase up to eight million shares of our common stock 
through december    shares of common stock had been purchased under the stock repurchase program 
we did not initiate any additional purchases of common stock under the stock repurchase program in  nor in we received  shares in and  shares in of our common stock  now held as treasury stock  from employees in cashless stock option exercises 
we received  shares in and  shares in of our common stock  now held as treasury stock  from employees to cover withholding taxes on stock option exercises 
we also received  shares in   shares in  and  shares in of our common stock  now held as treasury stock  from employees to cover withholding taxes on vested restricted stock 
capital expenditures during the year ended december  were million 
these capital expenditures included approximately million for the el dorado refinery  million for the cheyenne refinery  and  of capital for expenditures in our denver and houston offices  our asphalt terminal in nebraska and for our share of crude pipeline projects 
the approximately million of capital expenditures for our el dorado refinery included approximately million to begin the ultra low sulfur diesel compliance project  as well as operational  payout  safety  administrative  environmental and optimization projects 
the approximately million of capital expenditures for our cheyenne refinery included million of capital incurred due to the cheyenne refinery coker fire  million incurred on the low sulfur gasoline project   to begin the ultra low sulfur diesel compliance project  as well as environmental  operational  safety  administrative and payout projects 
compliance with the upcoming ultra low sulfur diesel requirements at our refineries will require additional capital expenditures through mid the total capital  including capitalized interest that we will utilize to comply with the regulations is estimated to be approximately million at the cheyenne refinery and approximately million at the el dorado refinery 
the expenditures for the ultra low sulfur diesel projects for were  at the cheyenne refinery and million at the el dorado refinery 
the remaining costs for the ultra low sulfur diesel projects at both refineries are expected to be spent in and the recently enacted american jobs creation act of will allow us  as a small business refiner  to deduct for federal income tax purposes of the qualified costs related to these low sulfur diesel expenditures in the years incurred as well as provide tax credits based on the resulting production of ultra low sulfur diesel up to of the remaining qualified costs 
capital expenditures aggregating approximately million are currently planned for  and include million at our el dorado refinery  million at our cheyenne refinery  and  for capital expenditures in our denver and houston offices  our asphalt terminal in nebraska and for our share of crude pipeline projects 
the million of planned capital expenditures for our el dorado refinery includes approximately million for the ultra low sulfur diesel project discussed above  nearly million of capital on the fccu  to be done in conjunction with the turnaround  as well as environmental  operational  safety  administrative and payout projects 
the million of planned capital expenditures for our cheyenne refinery includes approximately million for the ultra low sulfur diesel project discussed above  as well as environmental  operational  safety  administrative and payout projects 
our capital expenditures will be funded with cash generated by our operations and the utilization of a portion of our existing cash balance 
as of december   we had received payments of million from our insurers for reimbursement of costs related to the coker fire at the cheyenne refinery 
additional proceeds of million were received in early and were accrued as of december  as of december   we had million principal of total consolidated debt  of which all was long term debt  as we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we also had million outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
under the provisions of the purchase agreement with shell for our el dorado refinery  we have made  or may be required to make  contingent earn out payments for each of the years through equal to one half of the excess over million per year of the el dorado refinery s annual revenues less material costs and operating costs  other than depreciation 
the total amount of these contingent payments is capped at million  with an annual cap of million 
based on results  no payment was necessary in a payment of million was paid in early  based on results  and was accrued as of december  such contingency payments are recorded as additional acquisition costs 
including the payment we made in early  we have paid a total of million to date for contingent earn out payments 
our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of

we have a five year crude oil supply agreement  which began in  with baytex marketing ltd 
baytex  a canadian crude oil producer 
this agreement provides for us to purchase  bpd of a lloydminster crude oil blend  a heavy canadian crude  at a price equal to of the simple average of the near month settlement prices of the nymex light sweet crude oil contracts during the month of delivery  plus the cost of transportation based on the express pipeline tariff  less per barrel 
we have two contracts that obligate us for crude oil pipeline capacity into on the express pipeline from hardisty  alberta to guernsey  wyoming from which we then have pipeline access to take the crude oil to our cheyenne refinery

we were allowed to assign a portion of our capacity in earlier years for additional capacity in later years with this first contract 
our crude oil supply agreement with baytex includes an assignment of a portion of our pipeline capacity obligation to it 
in december  we entered into an expansion capacity agreement on the express pipeline for an additional  bpd of crude oil starting in april through of the additional  bpd  we assigned  bpd to another party starting in april through march our remaining express pipeline commitments range from a high of  bpd in  then reducing to  bpd in through early  and then reducing to  bpd through the amounts shown below for transportation  terminalling and storage contractual obligations are net of million  the approximate cost of the pipeline capacity assigned to other parties for the initial term of that agreement

critical accounting policies turnarounds 
the costs for turnarounds scheduled and required shutdowns of refinery operating units for significant overhaul and refurbishment are ratably accrued over the period from the prior turnaround to the next scheduled turnaround 
since utilizing this policy relies on estimated costs for the next turnaround  adjustments occur as the estimate changes or even when the turnaround is in progress should more or less extensive work be necessary than was anticipated 
these accruals are included in our consolidated balance sheets in the accrued turnaround cost and long term accrued turnaround cost 
the turnaround accrual  any turnaround costs in excess of accrual incurred at the time of turnaround  or reductions of expenses when the actual costs are less than the estimate are included in refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation in our consolidated statements of income 
turnaround costs include contract services  materials and rental equipment 
inventories 
inventories of crude oil  unfinished products and all finished products are recorded at the lower of cost on a fifo basis or market 
crude oil includes both domestic and foreign crude oil volumes at its cost and associated freight and other cost 
unfinished products work in process include any crude oil that has entered into the refining process  and other feedstocks that are not finished as far as refining operations are concerned 
these include unfinished gasoline and diesel  blendstocks and other feedstocks 
finished product inventory includes saleable gasoline  diesel  jet fuel  chemicals  asphalt and other finished products 
unfinished and finished products inventory values have components of raw material  the associated raw material freight and other costs  and direct refinery operating expense allocated when refining begins relative to their proportionate market values 
the fifo method of accounting for inventories sometimes results in frontier recognizing substantial gains in periods of rising prices or losses in periods of falling prices from our inventories of crude oil and products 
while we believe that this accounting method more accurately reflects the results of our operations  since many other refining companies instead utilize the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories  comparison of our results to other refineries must take into account the impact of the inventory accounting differences 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation is measured in accordance with accounting principles board apb no 
under this intrinsic value method  compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the quoted market value of frontier s common stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we have a stock option plan which authorizes the granting of options to employees to purchase shares 
options under the plan are granted at fair market value on the date of grant 
no entries are made in the accounts until the options are exercised  at which time the proceeds are credited to common stock and paid in capital 
no compensation expense is recorded

r which will require a change in our method of accounting for stock based compensation in this will require us to record compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date and will result in increased expenses  however  it is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements

when we make the decision to manage our price exposure  we neither incur losses from negative price changes nor do we obtain the benefit of positive price changes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk impact of changing prices 
our revenues and cash flows  as well as estimates of future cash flows  are very sensitive to changes in energy prices 
major shifts in the cost of crude oil  and the prices of refined products and natural gas can result in large changes in the operating margin from refining operations 
these prices also determine the carrying value of the refineries inventories 
price risk management activities 
at times  we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions  purchases of foreign crude oil and consumption of natural gas in the refining process or to fix margins on certain future production 
gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts accounted for as hedges are recognized in the consolidated statements of income as raw material  freight and other costs or refinery operating expenses  excluding depreciation when the associated transactions are consummated  while gains and losses on transactions accounted for using mark to market accounting are reflected in other revenues in the consolidated statements of income at each period end
