recent highlights throughout fiscal  we have continued to pursue our strategy of focusing on our analog product capabilities  particularly in the standard linear segments 
the world semiconductor trade statistics wsts define standard linear as amplifiers  data converters  regulators and references power management products  and interface 
as a part of this focus  we periodically identify opportunities to divest or reduce involvement in product areas that are not in line with our business objectives 
during fiscal  we completed the sales of our imaging business in september and the pc super i o business in may we entered into an agreement to sell our cordless business in may  and that sale was closed in june in addition  following our announcement in march to seek a buyer for our assembly and test facility in singapore  we announced in july that we now plan to close this facility and consolidate its production volume into our other assembly and test facilities in malaysia and china 
the majority of closure activities is expected to take place over the next nine to twelve months 
we achieved higher gross margins and profit in fiscal than in the prior fiscal year  despite some mid year market weakness that was caused by excess inventory levels in the supply chain 
this improved operating performance reflects our shift toward a richer analog product mix  combined with ongoing cost controls 
in january  we initiated a program to reduce expenses and streamline manufacturing operations as we saw wafer fabrication utilization rates decline in the second quarter of fiscal to the mid s due to significant inventory reductions in the distribution channel and lower demand than expected in some markets 
as we enter fiscal  we are continuing our focus on gross margin relative to sales and we are directing our research and development investments primarily at high value analog growth areas 
we continued our stock repurchases in fiscal under the million stock repurchase program originally announced in march and another million stock repurchase program that was approved by our board of directors in march under these programs we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal of these shares  million shares were repurchased in the open market for million 
the other million shares were repurchased through privately negotiated transactions with a major financial institution and include the repurchase of million shares for million in june upon the settlement of an advance repurchase contract entered into in april these stock repurchase activities comprise one element of our overall effort to consistently generate a high return on invested capital  which we believe improves shareholder value 
as of may   we had million remaining for future common stock repurchases under approved programs 
we also paid cash dividends of million during fiscal in june  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock 
the dividend totaling million was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  products semiconductors are integrated circuits in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated circuit or discrete devices such as individual transistors 
in an integrated circuit  various components are fabricated in a small area or chip of silicon  which is then encapsulated in plastic  ceramic or other advanced forms of packaging and connected to a circuit board or substrate 
we manufacture an extensive range of analog intensive and mixed signal integrated products  which are used in numerous applications 
while no precise industry definition exists for analog and mixed signal devices  we consider products which process analog information or convert analog to digital or digital to analog as analog and mixed signal devices 
we are a leading supplier of analog and mixed signal products  serving both broad based markets such as the industrial  communications  computing  consumer  medical and automotive markets  and more narrowly defined markets such as wireless handsets  lcd monitors  personal computers and hdtvs 
our analog and mixed signal devices include o operational and audio amplifiers  o communication interface o power references  regulators circuits  and switchers  o radio frequency integrated o analog to digital converters  circuits  and o flat panel display drivers and signal processors 
other products with significant analog content include products for local area and wireless networking and wireless communications  as well as products for personal systems and personal communications 
other product offerings that are not analog or mixed signal include microcontrollers  advanced input output pc products  connectivity processors and embedded bluetoothtm solutions that serve a wide variety of applications in the personal computer  industrial  automotive  consumer and communication markets 
during fiscal we pursued a strategy to divest certain businesses that were not core analog such as our pc super i o business and the cordless business unit 
our core analog and mixed signal products typically generate higher gross margins than the products of these businesses that we divested 
corporate organization  product line business units we are organized by various product line business units which are combined to form groups 
during fiscal  our operations were organized in the following five groups the analog group  the displays and wireless group  the pc and networking group  the custom solutions group  and the imaging group which was ultimately disbanded after the sale of its assets in september 
analog group analog products provide the vital technology link that allows the physical world to connect with digital information 
they are used to enable and enrich the experience of sight and sound of many electronic applications 
in addition to the real world interfaces  analog products are used extensively in power management and signal conditioning applications 
we continue to maintain a leadership position in power management technology 
our diverse portfolio of innovative intellectual property enables us to develop building block products  application specific standard analog products and full custom large scale integrations for our key customers in applications such as wireless handsets and flat panel displays 
in signal path applications  our innovative and high performance building blocks and application specific standard products allow our customers to differentiate their systems 
the analog group designs  develops and manufactures a wide range of products including o power management products power conversion  regulation and conservation  o high performance operational amplifiers  o high performance analog to digital converters and digital to analog converters  o high efficiency audio amplifiers  and o thermal management products 
with our leadership in innovative analog packaging and process technology  we are focused on high growth markets that depend upon portability and efficiency 
we are continuing to focus on servicing top tier original equipment manufacturers in the wireless and display markets and also expanding our presence in broader markets which are often served through distributors 
in fiscal  nearly percent of the analog group s revenues were derived from original equipment manufacturers  while the remaining percent came from our worldwide authorized distributors 
we also use our analog expertise to develop high performance analog products serving targeted applications in the broad consumer  industrial  medical  automotive and information infrastructure markets 
our growing portfolio of high performance analog building blocks includes high voltage regulators  high speed and precision op amps  and high speed  low power analog to digital converters 
these building block products can serve as the starting point for the development of highly integrated application specific standard products such as our current d audio subsystems 
the hi rel formerly enhanced solutions business unit of the analog group supplies integrated circuits and contract services to the high reliability market  which includes avionics  defense  space and the federal government 
displays and wireless group the displays and wireless group consists of two separate business groups displays and wireless 
we are a leader in analog video processing solutions for the displays market 
the displays group develops and manufactures products that provide higher resolution  brighter color and or better power efficiency for flat panels  crt monitors  notebook computer displays  lcd tv displays and personal client device displays 
the displays group consists of the following business units o flat panel displays  o crt  and o adaptive video converter 
the flat panel displays business unit provides a variety of innovative products for notebook thin film transistor tft displays  flat panel monitors  and lcd tv displays 
these include timing controllers  low voltage differential signal lvds data receivers  lvds transmitters and column drivers 
we have a significant market share in integrated lvds receivers and timing controllers that serve the notebook tft displays market while continuing to expand our position in the discrete lvds market 
we continue to solidify our position as a leading innovator in the displays space through a proliferation of display architecture standards we have developed advanced bus systems interface absi and point to point differential signal ppds 
absi driver technology supports chip on glass notebook and monitor panels 
ppds enables cinema quality display performance and small bezels for lcd tv applications 
the crt business unit offers a variety of video drivers and pre amplifiers that go into crt monitors and digital tvs 
because the overall market unit volume of crt monitors is expected to decline over time due to the increasing penetration of flat panel displays  this business unit s leading edge capabilities  including our high voltage processes  are being channeled toward opportunities in the fast growing digital tv market 
our product offerings include an integrated family of pre amplifiers with on screen display  and clamp and video drivers for a wide variety of crt display types 
the adaptive video converter business unit is targeting the emerging markets for digital television  hdtv  audio video receivers  up conversion dvd players and hd recorders 
the business s portfolio includes a family of products with a universal front end accepting standard and high definition video formats integrated with d video channels  flexible scaling  multi picture functions and advanced video enhancements to generate high quality output across a range of desired standard video formats 
the wireless group delivers solutions that perform the radio and other functions for handsets and base stations in the cellular and cordless telephone markets 
the wireless group leverages a number of technologies and standards o code division multiple access cdma  o personal digital cellular pdc  o personal handy system phs  o global systems for mobile communications gsm  and o digital cordless telephone technology dct there are two business units in the wireless group rf component and digital cordless 
the rf component business unit offers radio frequency components that address the synthesizer block of the radios in cdma and pdc handsets and gsm basestations and complete radio solutions for the phs handset space 
the digital cordless business unit referred to as our cordless business  which offered dect and dct based solutions for digital cordless voice and data applications  was sold in june we sold the business unit because it no longer aligned with our core analog strategy 
pc and networking group the pc and networking group consists of the networking business unit and the pc super i o business unit 
the networking business unit is made up of three divisions that address opportunities in the enterprise  communications infrastructure and embedded markets 
the enterprise division provides mixed signal solutions for switches and routers 
the communications infrastructure division provides high speed physical interconnect products for wireless  telecom  data networking and professional video applications 
the embedded division provides products used in networked peripherals in certain enterprise and consumer markets 
the pc super i o business unit was sold in may this business unit provided mixed signal i o products for servers  desktops  mobile and storage computing and focused on solutions for connectivity  security and manageability 
we sold the business unit because we determined that it no longer fit with our core analog strategy 
custom solutions group the custom solutions group primarily consists of the following two business units device connectivity and asic telecom 
the device connectivity business unit supplies connectivity processors  embedded bluetoothtm solutions  general purpose microcontrollers and dvd chipset solutions 
our connectivity processors are marketed under the cp family and are based on our cr core integrated with advanced connectivity peripherals  and are combined with optimized application software to address applications needing device connectivity 
applications include bluetoothtm accessories  telematics automotive and industrial equipment 
our general purpose and bit microcontrollers address a wide variety of applications in the industrial  automotive  consumer and communication markets 
the asic telecom business unit supplies user designed application specific products in the form of standard cells and gate arrays  key telecommunications components for analog and digital line cards  as well as ac compliant audio codecs for consumer and automotive applications 
this business unit also handles the logistics for providing materials and services to third parties in support of the transitional service agreements associated with businesses that we have divested 
imaging group we completed the sale of certain intellectual property  inventory and equipment of our imaging business to eastman kodak company in september during our second fiscal quarter 
our imaging group was disbanded in fiscal following this sale of assets 
worldwide marketing and sales and central technology and manufacturing group separate from our business operating groups  our corporate structure in fiscal includes a centralized worldwide marketing and sales group and a central technology and manufacturing group ctmg 
worldwide marketing and sales is structured around the four major regions of the world where we operate the americas  europe  japan and asia pacific and unites our worldwide sales and marketing organization 
ctmg manages all production  including outsourced manufacturing and central support technology 
central support technology includes process technology  which consists of research and process development necessary for many of our core production processes  packaging technology and research 
ctmg provides a range of process libraries  product cores and software that are shared among our product lines 
this group is also responsible for the selection and usage of common support tools  including integrated computer aided design for design  layout and simulation 
at the beginning of fiscal  we re organized our operations to combine the office of the chief operating officer together with the office of the president and promoted donald macleod to president and chief operating officer 
in connection with this change  we re organized our product lines into two product groups as follows o analog signal path group o power management group o amplifier division  o power management products division  o audio division  o portable power systems division  o data conversion division  o flat panel display and avc divisions  o interface division  o device connectivity division  and o emerging products division  o asic telecom 
and o hi rel operations 
in addition  we disbanded ctmg and separated its functional groups into a different reporting structure 
the product groups  worldwide marketing and sales and the former ctmg operations now all report to the president and chief operating officer 
segment financial information and geographic information for segment reporting purposes  each of our product line business units represents an operating segment as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
business units that have similarities  including economic characteristics  underlying technology  markets and customers  are aggregated into larger segments 
under the criteria in sfas no 
 analog is our only reportable segment for fiscal the remaining business units that are not included in the analog reportable segment are grouped as all other 
for further financial information on this segment  as well as geographic information  refer to the information contained in note  segment and geographic information  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item marketing and sales we market our products globally to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers through a direct sales force 
some of our major oems include o apple computer  o lm ericsson  o sharp  o robert bosch  o matsushita electric  o siemens  o delphi  o motorola  o sony  o kyocera  o nokia  o sony ericsson mobile o lg electronics  o samsung  communication  and o toshiba 
there is a prevalent trend in the technology industry where oems use contract manufacturers to build their products and odms to design and build products 
as a result  our design wins with major oems  particularly in the personal computer and cellular phone markets  can ultimately result in sales to a third party manufacturer 
in addition to our direct sales force  we use distributors in our four business regions  and approximately percent of our fiscal net sales were generated through distributors 
in line with industry practices  we generally credit distributors for the effect of price reductions on their inventory of our products and  under specific conditions  we repurchase products that we have discontinued 
distributors do not have the right to return product except under customary warranty provisions 
the programs we offer to our distributors include the following o allowances involving pricing and volume 
we refer to this as the contract sales debit program  o discount for early payment 
we refer to this as the prompt payment program  and o allowance for inventory scrap 
we refer to this as the scrap allowance program 
under the contract sales debit program  products are sold to distributors at standard published prices that are contained in price books that are broadly provided to our various distributors 
distributors are required to pay for this product within our standard commercial terms 
after the initial purchase of the product  the distributor has the opportunity to request a price allowance for a particular part number depending on the current market conditions for that specific part as well as volume considerations 
this request is made prior to the distributor reselling the part 
once we have approved an allowance to the distributor  the distributor proceeds with the resale of the product and credits are issued to the distributor in accordance with the specific allowance that we approved 
periodically  we issue new distributor price books 
for those parts for which the standard prices have been reduced  we provide an immediate credit to distributors for inventory quantities they have on hand 
under the prompt payment program  certain distributors are granted a fixed percentage discount off the invoice price for payment earlier than our standard commercial terms 
under the scrap allowance program  certain distributors are given a contractually defined allowance to cover the cost of any scrap they might incur 
the amount of the allowance is specifically agreed upon with each distributor 
our regional facilities in the united states  europe  japan and asia pacific handle local customer support 
these customer support centers respond to inquiries on product pricing and availability  pre sale customer technical support requests  order entry and scheduling  and post sale support under our product warranty provisions 
the technical support provided to our customers consists of marketing activities that occur prior to sale of product to our customers and for which we have no contractual obligation and no fees are charged 
technical support consists primarily of aiding customers in product selection and answering questions about our products 
we augment our sales effort with application engineers based in the field 
these engineers are specialists in our product portfolio and work with customers to identify and design our integrated circuits into customers products and applications 
these engineers also help identify emerging markets for new products and are supported by our design centers in the field or at manufacturing sites 
we also provide web based  online tools that allow customers and potential customers to select our devices  create a design using our parts  and simulate performance of that design 
customers the distributor avnet accounted for percent of our net sales in fiscal and  and percent of our net sales in fiscal in addition  the distributor arrow accounted for percent of our net sales in fiscal  and although we do not have any other customers with sales greater than percent  we do have several large oem customers that manufacture and market wireless handsets  among other electronic products 
these customers typically purchase a variety of different products from us 
if any one of these customers were to cease all purchases from us within a very short timeframe  such as within one quarter  it could have a negative impact on our financial results for that period 
however  we have not had any such experience to date 
backlog in accordance with industry practice  we frequently revise semiconductor backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders to reflect changes in customer needs 
we rarely formally enforce binding agreements for the sale of specific quantities at specific prices that are contractually subject to price or quantity revisions  consistent with industry practice 
for these reasons  we do not believe it is meaningful to disclose the amount of backlog at any particular date 
seasonality we are affected by the seasonal trends in the semiconductor and related industries 
we typically experience sequentially lower sales in our first and third fiscal quarters  primarily due to customer vacation and holiday schedules 
sales usually reach a seasonal peak in our fourth fiscal quarter 
quarterly seasonality in fiscal  especially in the second quarter  was not consistent with these trends as our business was affected by excess inventories in the supply chain 
as a result  sales in our second fiscal quarter were down from the preceding first quarter and sales in our third fiscal quarter were flat with the second quarter 
manufacturing the design of semiconductor and integrated circuit products is shaped by general market needs and customer requirements 
following product design and development  we generally produce integrated circuits in the following steps o wafer fabrication 
product designs are compiled and digitized by state of the art design equipment and then transferred to silicon wafers in a series of complex precision processes that include oxidation  lithography  chemical etching  diffusion  deposition  implantation and metallization 
o wafer sort 
the silicon wafers are tested and separated into individual circuit devices 
o product assembly 
tiny wires are used to connect the electronic circuits on the device to the stronger metal leads of the package in which the device is encapsulated for protection 
o final test 
the devices are subjected to a series of vigorous tests using computerized circuit testers and  for certain applications  environmental testers such as burn in ovens  centrifuges  temperature cycle or moisture resistance testers  salt atmosphere testers and thermal shock testers 
o coating 
certain devices in the analog portfolio are designed to be used without traditional packaging 
in this case  the integrated circuit is coated with a protective material and mounted directly onto the circuit board 
wafer fabrication is concentrated in two facilities in the united states and one in scotland 
during fiscal  nearly all product assembly and final test operations were performed at our three facilities located in malaysia  singapore and china 
in july  we announced that we plan to close our assembly and test facility in singapore and consolidate its production volume into our other assembly and test facilities in malaysia and china 
the majority of closure activities is expected to take place over the next nine to twelve months 
we use subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing functions in the united states  europe  israel  southeast asia  china and japan to address capacity and other economic issues 
our wafer manufacturing processes include bipolar  metal oxide silicon  complementary metal oxide silicon and bipolar complementary metal oxide silicon technologies  including silicon germanium 
our efforts are heavily focused on processes that support our analog portfolio of products  which address wireless handsets  displays  computers and a broad variety of other electronic applications 
bipolar processes primarily support our standard products 
the width of the individual transistors on a chip is measured in microns  one micron equals one millionth of a meter 
as products decrease in size and increase in functionality  our wafer fabrication facilities must be able to manufacture integrated circuits with sub micron circuit pattern widths 
this precision fabrication carries over to assembly and test operations  where advanced packaging technology and comprehensive testing are required to address the ever increasing performance and complexity embedded in integrated circuits 
raw materials our manufacturing processes use certain key raw materials critical to our products 
these include silicon wafers  certain chemicals and gases  ceramic and plastic packaging materials and various precious metals 
we also rely on subcontractors to supply finished or semi finished products which we then market through our sales channels 
we obtain raw materials and semi finished or finished products from various sources  although the number of sources for any particular material or product is relatively limited 
we feel our current supply of essential materials is adequate 
however  shortages have occurred from time to time and could occur again 
significant increases in demand  rapid product mix changes or natural disasters could affect our ability to procure materials or goods 
research and development our research and development efforts consist of research in metallurgical  electro mechanical and solid state sciences  manufacturing process development and product design 
research and development of most process and packaging technologies are conducted by our process technology group 
specific product design and development is generally done in our business units 
total r d expenses were million for fiscal  or percent of net sales  compared to million for fiscal  or percent of net sales  and million for fiscal  or percent of net sales 
these amounts exclude an in process r d charge of million related to the acquisition of digitalquake in fiscal in process r d charges are included in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of other operating expense  net 
total company spending through fiscal for new product development was down percent  and for process and support technology was down percent from fiscal primarily because of expenses we eliminated in the business areas we have exited 
although research and development spending was down as a whole and as a percentage of sales  research and development spending for our analog segment increased as we continue to invest in the development of our analog capabilities to address a variety of markets 
a significant portion of our research and development is directed at power management technology 
patents we own numerous united states and non us patents and have many patent applications pending 
we consider the development of patents and the maintenance of an active patent program advantageous to the conduct of our business 
however  we believe that continued success will depend more on engineering  production  marketing  financial and managerial skills than on our patent program 
we license certain of our patents to other manufacturers and participate in a number of cross licensing arrangements and agreements with other parties 
each license agreement has unique terms and conditions  with variations as to length of term  royalties payable  permitted uses and scope 
the majority of these agreements are cross licenses in which we grant a broad license to our intellectual property in exchange for receiving a similar corresponding license from the other party  and none are exclusive 
the amount of income we have received from licensing agreements has varied in the past  and we cannot precisely forecast the amount and timing of future income from licensing agreements 
on an overall basis  we believe that no single license agreement is material to us  either in terms of royalty payments due or payable or intellectual property rights granted or received 
employees at may   we employed approximately  people of whom approximately  were employed in the united states  in europe   in southeast asia  in china and in other areas 
we believe that our future success depends fundamentally on our ability to recruit and retain skilled technical and professional personnel 
our employees in the united states are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations worldwide to be favorable 
competition competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
with our focus on analog  our major competitors include analog devices  linear technology  maxim  st microelectronics  and texas instruments that sell competing products into some of the same markets that we target 
in some cases  we may also compete with our customers 
competition is based on design and quality of products  product performance  price and service  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products and markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
environmental regulations to date  our compliance with foreign  federal  state and local laws or regulations that have been enacted to regulate the environment has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  competitive or financial position 
for more information  see item  legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item however  we could be subject to fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of our operations if we fail to comply with present or future statutes and regulations governing the use  storage  handling  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
item properties we conduct manufacturing  as well as process research and product development  in our wafer fabrication facilities located in arlington  texas  south portland  maine  and greenock  scotland 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization during fiscal averaged percent  based on wafer starts  compared to percent for fiscal we exited fiscal with average wafer fabrication capacity utilization in the high percent range during the fourth quarter 
we expect our captive manufacturing capacity together with our third party subcontract manufacturing arrangements to be adequate to supply our needs in the foreseeable future 
our assembly and test functions are performed primarily in southeast asia and china 
these facilities are located in melaka  malaysia and toa payoh  singapore  as well as our new assembly and test facility in suzhou  china that began operation in fiscal in july  we announced that we plan to close our assembly and test facility in singapore and consolidate its production volume into our other assembly and test facilities in malaysia and china 
the majority of closure activities is expected to take place over the next nine to twelve months 
our principal administrative and research facilities are located in santa clara  california 
our regional headquarters for worldwide marketing and sales are located in santa clara  california  munich  germany  tokyo  japan  and kowloon  hong kong 
we maintain local sales offices and sales service centers in various locations and countries throughout our four business regions 
we also operate small design facilities in various locations in the us  among which include arlington  texas  indianapolis  indiana  salem  new hampshire  calabasas  california  longmont  colorado  san diego  california  federal way  washington  norcross  georgia  south portland  maine  fort collins  colorado  phoenix  arizona  and grass valley  california  rochester  new york  tucson  arizona  and at overseas locations including china  estonia  finland  germany  india  japan  the netherlands  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we own our manufacturing facilities and our corporate headquarters 
in general  we lease most of our design facilities and our sales and administrative offices 
as we described in the business section under item  our manufacturing operations are centralized and shared among our product lines and no individual facility is dedicated to a specific operating segment 
we believe our facilities are suitable and have adequate capacity for our current needs 
further  we believe space and capacity will be available if needed in the future 
item legal proceedings we currently are a party to various legal proceedings  including those noted below 
while we believe that the ultimate outcome of these various proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations  litigation is always subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from selling one or more products 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in which the ruling occurs  and future periods 
tax matters the irs has completed its field examination of our tax returns for fiscal years through and on july  issued a notice of proposed adjustment seeking additional taxes of approximately million exclusive of interest for those years 
the issues giving rise to most of the proposed adjustments relate to r d credits  inventory and depreciation deductions 
we are contesting the adjustments through the irs administrative process 
we are undergoing tax audits in several international locations and from time to time our tax returns are audited in the us by state agencies and at international locations by local tax authorities 
during fiscal  we resolved a tax audit at one of our international locations  which resulted in a million reduction in our fiscal tax expense 
we believe we have made adequate tax payments and or accrued adequate amounts such that the outcome of these audits will have no material adverse effect on our financial statements 
environmental matters we have been named to the national priorities list superfund for our santa clara  california site and we have completed a remedial investigation feasibility study with the regional water quality control board rwqcb  which is acting as agent for the epa 
we have agreed in principle with the rwqcb on a site remediation plan  and we are conducting remediation and cleanup efforts at the site 
in addition to the santa clara site  we have been designated from time to time as a potentially responsible party by international  federal and state agencies for certain environmental sites with which we may have had direct or indirect involvement 
these designations are made regardless of the extent of our involvement 
these claims are in various stages of administrative or judicial proceedings and include demands for recovery of past governmental costs and for future investigations and remedial actions 
in many cases  the dollar amounts of the claims have not been specified and the claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same cost recovery or other relief as is sought from us 
we have also retained liability for environmental matters arising from our former operations of dynacraft  inc and the fairchild business  but we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings relating to those liabilities 
we accrue costs associated with environmental matters when they become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of all environmental charges to earnings  including charges relating to the santa clara site remediation  excluding potential reimbursements from insurance coverage  has not been material during each of the last three fiscal years 
we believe that the potential liability for environmental matters  if any  in excess of amounts already accrued in our financial statements will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other in november  a derivative action was filed in the us district court in delaware against us  fairchild semiconductor international  inc and sterling holding company  llc  by mark levy  a fairchild stockholder 
the action was brought under section b of the securities exchange act of and the rules issued under that act by the securities and exchange commission 
the plaintiff seeks disgorgement of alleged short swing insider trading profits 
we had originally acquired fairchild common and preferred stock in march at the time we disposed of the fairchild business 
prior to its initial public offering in august  fairchild had amended its certificate of incorporation to provide that all fairchild preferred stock would convert automatically to common stock upon completion of the initial public offering 
as a result  our shares of preferred stock converted to common stock in august plaintiff has alleged that our acquisition of common stock through the conversion constituted an acquisition that should be matched against our sale in january of fairchild common stock for purposes of computing short swing trading profits 
the action seeks to recover from us on behalf of fairchild alleged recoverable profits of approximately million 
in february  the district court granted the motion to dismiss filed by us and our co defendants and dismissed the case  ruling that the conversion was done pursuant to a reclassification which is exempt from the scope of section b 
plaintiff appealed the dismissal of the case and upon appeal  the us court of appeals for the third circuit reversed the district court s dismissal 
our petition for a panel rehearing and or rehearing en banc was denied by the appeals court in april our petition to the us supreme court for a writ of certiorari was denied in october the case has completed discovery in the district court 
in june   the securities and exchange commission proposed clarifying amendments to its section b rules which we believe would be dispositive of the case 
in september  the district court ordered a stay of the case pending the sec s adoption of the proposed amendments 
in june  plaintiff filed a writ of mandamus with the us court of appeals for the third circuit seeking an order requiring the district court to lift its stay 
in july  the sec informed the appeals court that the sec was actively considering the proposed rule amendment and in august  announced the adoption of the amendments which we believe exempt us from liability in this case 
nevertheless  we intend to continue to contest the case through all available means 
in january  a class action suit was filed against us and a number of our suppliers in california superior court by james harris and other former and present employees claiming damages for personal injury 
the complaint alleges that cancer and or reproductive harm were caused to employees as a result of alleged exposure to toxic chemicals while working at our company 
plaintiffs claim to have worked at sites in santa clara and or in greenock  scotland 
in addition  one plaintiff claims to represent a class of children of company employees who allegedly sustained developmental harm as a result of alleged in utero exposure to toxic chemicals while their mothers worked at the company 
although no specific amount of monetary damages is claimed  plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of the classes for personal injuries  nervous shock  physical and mental pain  fear of future illness  medical expenses and loss of earnings and earnings capacity 
the court has required the scottish employees to seek their remedies in scottish courts 
the court has also denied plaintiffs motion for certification of a medical monitoring class 
discovery in the case is proceeding and we intend to defend this action vigorously 
in september  itech group  inc brought suit against us in california superior court alleging a number of contract and tort claims related to a software license agreement we entered into earlier in and the proposed sale of one of our business units 
the case began trial in may and the jury in the case found for itech group  inc on claims of breach of contract  promissory fraud and unjust enrichment  awarding plaintiff compensatory damages of approximately thousand and punitive damages of million 
in post trial motions heard by the court in july  the court ordered the verdict of punitive damages to be reduced to million  subject to plaintiff itech s approval of the reduction 
the court also found us liable for approximately thousand in attorneys fees 
plaintiff has until the close of business on august  to accept the reduction 
at the time of the filing of this form k  we do not know what itech will do 
we intend to contest the case through all available means  including appeal  if necessary

item selected financial data the following selected financial information has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements 
the information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in item five year selected financial data years ended in millions  except per share amounts and may  may  may  may  may  employee figures operating results net sales      operating costs and expenses      operating income loss interest income  net other non operating expense income  net income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income tax benefit expense income loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net income loss earnings loss per share income loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle basic diluted net income loss basic diluted weighted average common and potential common shares outstanding basic diluted financial position at year end working capital  total assets      long term debt total debt shareholders equity      other data research and development capital additions number of employees in thousands during fiscal  we paid cash dividends of million on our common stock 
we did not pay cash dividends on our common stock in any of the previous years presented above 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements relate to  among other things  sales  gross margins  operating expenses  capital expenditures  r d efforts and asset dispositions and are indicated by words or phrases such as anticipate  expect  outlook  foresee  believe  could  intend  and similar words or phrases 
these statements are based on our current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations 
these forward looking statements should not be relied upon as predictions of future events as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur 
the following are among the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements general business and economic conditions in the semiconductor industry and the economy generally and in various markets such as wireless  pc and displays  pricing pressures and competitive factors  delays in the introduction of new products or lack of market acceptance for new products  risks of international operations  our success in acquisitions and or dispositions and achieving the desired improvements associated with those acquisitions and or dispositions  legislative and regulatory changes  the outcome of legal  administrative and other proceedings that we are involved in  the results of our programs to control and reduce costs  and the general worldwide geopolitical situation 
for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements  see the discussion on risk factors that appears below and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this and our other reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof and disclaim any obligation to do so 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto o critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies are those policies that have a significant effect on the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies also require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments a revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of semiconductor products upon shipment  provided we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement typically in the form of a purchase order  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the amount is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated future returns at the time of shipment 
approximately percent of our semiconductor product sales were made through distributors in fiscal we have agreements with our distributors that cover various programs  including pricing adjustments based on resale pricing and volume  price protection for inventory  discounts for prompt payment and scrap allowances 
the revenue we record for these distribution sales is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net distribution revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
our estimates are based upon historical experience rates by geography and product family  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  and other related factors 
actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our estimates 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results are dependent on our ability to make reliable estimates  and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results 
service revenues are recognized as the services are provided or as milestones are achieved  depending on the terms of the arrangement 
these revenues are included in net sales and are not a material component of our total net sales 
certain intellectual property income is classified as revenue if it meets specified criteria established by company policy that defines whether it is considered a source of income from our primary operations 
these revenues are included in net sales and are not a material component of our total net sales 
all other intellectual property income that does not meet such criteria is not considered a source of income from primary operations and is therefore classified as a component of other operating income  net  in the consolidated statement of operations 
intellectual property income is recognized when the license is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is reasonably assured and no further obligations to the other party exist 
b valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount that is the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
reductions in carrying value are deemed to establish a new cost basis 
therefore  inventory is not written up if estimates of market value subsequently improve 
our products are classified as either custom  which are those products manufactured with customer specified features or characteristics  or non custom  which are those products that do not have customer specified features or characteristics 
we evaluate obsolescence by analyzing the inventory aging  order backlog and future customer demand on an individual product basis 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than what we have estimated  we may be required to write inventory down below the current carrying value 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the end markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reliable estimates 
the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory has been materially consistent with previously estimated write downs we have recorded 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory for lower of cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are intended to identify any difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is determined as the selling price of the product less the estimated cost of disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than what we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
c impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
amortizable intangible assets subject to this evaluation include developed technology we have acquired  patents and technology licenses 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include o significant decrease in the market value of an asset o significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition o a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset o significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions o current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset our impairment evaluation of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
if  as a result of our analysis  we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value of our reporting units with goodwill 
the fair value of a reporting unit is measured at the business unit level using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs for those business units 
our reporting units in fiscal with goodwill include our wireless  displays  power management  non audio amplifier and communications interface business units  which are operating segments within our analog reportable segment  and our device connectivity business unit  which is included in all others 
our estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
if we fail to deliver new products for these business units  or if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or market conditions for these businesses fail to sustain improvement  our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur charges for goodwill impairment  which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our net equity and results of operations 
d income taxes we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using the enacted tax rate expected to be applied when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider past performance  expected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is based on historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods that the deferred tax assets are deductible 
changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the us and international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income 
these changes  if any  may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we currently have recorded  such adjustment could have a material impact on the tax expense for the fiscal year 
we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations 
o overview throughout fiscal  we have continued to pursue our strategy of focusing on our analog product capabilities  particularly in the standard linear segments 
the world semiconductor trade statistics wsts define standard linear as amplifiers  data converters  regulators and references power management products  and interface 
as a part of this focus  we periodically identify opportunities to divest or reduce involvement in product areas that are not in line with our business objectives 
during fiscal  we completed the sale of our imaging business in september and the pc super i o business in may we entered into an agreement to sell our cordless business in may  and that sale was closed in june in addition  following our announcement in march to seek a buyer for our assembly and test facility in singapore  we announced in july that we now plan to close this facility and consolidate its production volume into our other assembly and test facilities in malaysia and china 
the majority of closure activities is expected to take place over the next nine to twelve months 
we achieved higher gross margins and profit in fiscal over the last fiscal year  despite some mid year market weakness 
this improved performance reflects our shift toward a richer analog product mix  combined with ongoing cost controls 
in january  we initiated a program to reduce expenses and streamline manufacturing operations as we saw wafer fabrication utilization rates decline in the second quarter of fiscal to the mid s due to significant inventory reductions in the distribution channel and lower demand than expected in some markets 
as we enter fiscal  we are continuing our focus on gross margin relative to sales with research and development investments aimed primarily at high value analog growth areas 
in reviewing our performance we consider several key financial measures 
when reviewing our net sales performance  we look at sales growth rates  new order rates including turns orders  blended average selling prices  sales of new products and market share in the standard linear category as defined by wsts 
we generally define new products as those introduced within the last three years 
we gauge our operating income performance based on gross margin trends  product mix  blended average selling prices  factory utilization rates and operating expenses relative to sales 
we are focused on generating a consistently high return on invested capital by concentrating on operating income  working capital management  capital expenditures and cash management 
we determine return on invested capital based on net operating income after tax divided by invested capital  which generally consists of total assets less goodwill and non interest bearing liabilities 
we continued our stock repurchases in fiscal under the million stock repurchase program originally announced in march and another million stock repurchase program that was approved by our board of directors in march under these programs we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal of these shares  million shares were repurchased in the open market for million 
the other million shares were repurchased through privately negotiated transactions with a major financial institution and include the repurchase of million shares for million in june upon the settlement of an advance repurchase contract entered into in april these stock repurchase activities comprise one element of our overall effort to consistently generate a high return on invested capital  which we believe improves shareholder value 
as of may   we had million remaining for future common stock repurchases under approved programs 
we also paid cash dividends of million during fiscal in june  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock 
the dividend totaling million was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  the following table and discussion provide an overview of our operating results for fiscal years  and years ended may  may  may  in millions change change net sales    operating income loss as a of net sales net income loss as a of net sales net sales in fiscal were percent lower than net sales in fiscal although sales in the first half of fiscal were higher compared to sales in the first half of fiscal  we experienced sequential quarterly sales declines in the first two quarters of the fiscal year due to excess inventories in the supply chain along with slower end market growth rates compared to the last half of fiscal consequently  sales were much lower in the second half of fiscal compared to sales in the second half of fiscal for the company overall  our unit shipments were down percent in fiscal from unit shipments in fiscal however  our blended average selling prices were up in fiscal by percent over fiscal these blended average selling prices are affected by product mix as well as changes in product prices 
our improvement in net income was driven by these higher blended average selling prices  higher gross margin and lower operating expenses 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a slight favorable impact on our foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal net income for fiscal includes an million impairment loss on goodwill of the wireless reporting unit as a result of our annual assessment of goodwill impairment and a million charge for cost reduction actions taken during the year see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income for fiscal also includes an million gain from the sale of assets associated with our imaging business in september and a million gain from the sale of assets associated with our pc super i o business in may see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other operating income  net for fiscal includes a credit of million related to the zf micro solutions  inc litigation that was settled in december see note to the consolidated financial statements  a net reimbursement of million for litigation costs  a refund of million from the california manufacturer s investment credit  and net intellectual property income of million 
these credits were partially offset by a charge of million related to the itech litigation and a million charge related to settlement of an intellectual property matter 
fiscal net income also includes a tax benefit of million arising from income tax expense of million offset by a benefit from the change in the beginning of the year valuation allowance of million 
net sales were greater in fiscal than in fiscal the sales increases were attributable to both higher industry demand and our market share gains in key standard linear markets  particularly for power management products 
unit shipments for the company were up percent in fiscal from unit shipments in fiscal  while blended average selling prices were flat 
the improvement in net income in fiscal over fiscal was driven by higher gross margin on higher sales  as well as lower operating expenses 
net income for fiscal included a net charge of million for cost reduction actions and the exit and sale of the information appliance business  consisting primarily of the geodetm family of integrated processor products  completed in august see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other operating expense  net for fiscal included charges of million arising from a lawsuit brought against us by zf micro solutions  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements and million for the settlement of certain patent infringement claims  which were partially offset by million of net intellectual property income 
fiscal net income also included a million charge including a tax effect of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
o net sales years ended may  may  may  in millions change change analog segment as a of net sales all others as a of net sales total net sales    the chart above and the following discussion are based on our reportable segments described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the analog segment represented percent of our total sales compared to percent in fiscal analog segment sales in the first half of fiscal grew percent over sales in the first half of fiscal however  efforts by distributors and customers to reduce inventories combined with lower than expected demand patterns as we exited the summer quarter caused sales for the second half of fiscal to decline percent compared to sales in the second half of fiscal although distributors continued to reduce inventories during the second half of fiscal  we have seen these activities at distributors stabilize in the most recently completed fourth quarter as our sales grew sequentially over the previous third quarter 
our analog unit shipments were down percent in fiscal from fiscal  but blended average analog selling prices were up by percent in fiscal over fiscal  reflecting both a mix of higher value products as well as some actual price increases 
within the analog segment  sales from the power management area continued to grow for fiscal with a percent increase over fiscal this was driven mainly by increased activity in wireless handsets 
sales from both the audio amplifier and data conversion business units increased by percent in fiscal over fiscal however  sales from the application specific wireless including radio frequency building blocks and non audio amplifier business units declined in fiscal by percent and percent  respectively  from fiscal the decrease in radio frequency chip sales was due to a trend in cellular handsets in which the radio function is migrating from discrete building block solutions to more highly integrated chips 
phones that utilize integrated radios typically do not need discrete pll building block chips  such as those sold by national 
for fiscal  sales decreased in all geographic regions compared to fiscal the decreases were percent in the americas and percent in the asia pacific region while both europe and japan each decreased percent 
sales in fiscal as a percentage of total sales remained flat at percent in europe and percent in japan  while the asia pacific region increased to percent and the americas decreased to percent 
foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal were favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the japanese yen  pound sterling and euro all strengthened against the dollar 
however  the impact was minimal since only percent of our total sales was denominated in a foreign currency 
beginning in fiscal  product families within the standard analog business unit  which was previously a separate business unit of the analog segment  were reassigned to the other business units within the analog segment 
the corresponding sales information presented below for fiscal compared to fiscal has been reclassified to reflect this change 
our sales growth in fiscal was essentially all due to the analog segment 
growth in analog segment sales was driven by higher consumer demand for products such as wireless phones and notebook computers  and also because of a general trend towards increased analog semiconductor content in a variety of electronic products 
unit volume was up percent over the prior year and blended average selling prices for fiscal as a whole grew slightly at percent over fiscal blended average selling prices were higher in the second half of fiscal  reflecting both a richer mix of products as well as actual price improvements  as we actively strived to increase our sales of high value  high performance analog products 
within the analog segment  sales of power management products led the growth in sales with an increase of percent from sales in fiscal where we continued to grow at a faster rate than the overall market 
also contributing to the growth in fiscal were sales of audio amplifier products with an increase of percent and sales of data conversion and application specific wireless including radio frequency building blocks products each with increases of percent over sales in fiscal for fiscal  sales increased in all geographic regions compared to fiscal the increases were percent in japan  percent in the asia pacific region  percent in europe and percent in the americas 
as a percentage of total sales  the asia pacific region remained at percent and europe remained at percent  while japan increased to percent of total sales and the americas decreased to percent 
foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal were favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the japanese yen  pound sterling and euro all strengthened against the dollar  but the impact on overall fiscal sales was minimal since only a quarter of our total sales was denominated in foreign currency 
o gross margin years ended may  may  may  in millions change change net sales    cost of sales gross margin   as a of net sales the increase in gross margin percentage in compared to was mainly driven by improvements in product mix and blended average selling prices 
our wafer fabrication capacity utilization based on wafer starts was actually down year over year at percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal because of this lower utilization  we implemented mandatory factory shutdowns and initiated an action in january to eliminate manufacturing personnel positions 
our product mix has improved through active efforts to increase the portion of our business that comes from high value  higher performance analog products  which are more proprietary in nature and can generate higher margins than products that are less proprietary or are multi sourced 
since these analog products generally have higher margins than non analog products  the growth in analog segment sales to percent of total net sales in fiscal from percent of total net sales in fiscal also had a positive impact on gross margin  despite lower factory utilization 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal over fiscal was driven by a combination of higher factory utilization and improvement in product mix 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization during fiscal was percent  based on wafer starts  compared to percent for fiscal the product mix improvements discussed above  combined with higher factory utilization and an increase in analog segment sales to percent of total sales in fiscal as compared to percent in fiscal all contributed to the gross margin increase in fiscal as noted above  our analog products generally have higher margins than non analog products 
o research and development years ended may  may  may  in millions change change research and development as a of net sales research and development expenses shown in the table above exclude an in process r d charge of million in fiscal lower research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal reflect full year cost savings from our sale and exit of the information appliance business in august and the completion in fiscal of other actions aimed at reducing our research and development expenses as a percentage of sales 
r d expenses for fiscal also reflect reductions due to the sale of the imaging and pc super i o businesses that occurred during the fiscal year 
we are continuing to concentrate our ongoing research and development spending on analog products and underlying analog capabilities 
total company spending in fiscal compared to fiscal was down percent for new product development and percent for process and support technology 
although research and development spending for the year is down as a whole and as a percentage of sales  research and development spending on our key focus areas in the analog segment increased as we continued to invest in the development of new analog and mixed signal technology based products for wireless handsets  displays  notebook pcs  other portable devices  as well as applications for the broader markets requiring analog technology 
a significant portion of our research and development is directed at power management technology 
lower research and development expenses in fiscal from fiscal reflect the full year impact of actions we initially launched in february to reduce our research and development expenses as a percentage of sales 
these actions included exits of businesses  headcount reductions and restructuring of a licensing agreement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company 
total company spending through fiscal for new product development was down percent 
fiscal spending on process and support technology was down percent from fiscal primarily because the business areas we exited had been incurring proportionally higher process and support technology related expenditures 
o selling  general and administrative years ended may  may  may  in millions change change selling  general and administrative as a of net sales the reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal reflect our continuing efforts to manage our cost structure more efficiently 
in addition  we implemented discretionary cost control programs during fiscal in response to the industry wide sales declines we saw in the early part of the fiscal year that was driven by excess inventories in the supply chain 
although to a much lesser extent than r d expenses  sg a expenses for fiscal also reflect some reductions due to the sale of the imaging and pc super i o businesses that occurred during the fiscal year 
the sg a expenses in fiscal are down from fiscal not only in actual dollars  but also as a percent of sales 
the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal over fiscal were consistent with increased business levels and were mainly due to higher costs in fiscal related to employee compensation and benefits  as well as incremental costs for outside services 
although sales levels increased substantially in fiscal  we focused on controlling our cost structure in a way that allowed sales to rise faster than expenses 
as a result  sg a expenses as a percent of sales declined from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal o cost reduction programs and restructuring of operations our fiscal results include net charges of million for cost reduction and restructuring charges related to several actions taken during fiscal these actions include workforce reductions connected with the divestiture of the imaging business  the streamlining of manufacturing to address the lower utilization of manufacturing facilities experienced during the fiscal year and a reorganization of our business operations effective at the beginning of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges  as well as a discussion of fiscal activity related to previously announced actions 
during fiscal  we substantially completed all cost reduction actions related to our strategic profit improvement actions initially launched in february these actions included the exit and sale of the information appliance business  and other actions aimed at improving profitability and return on invested capital 
net charges in fiscal for cost reduction programs and restructuring of operations were million 
o interest income and interest expense years ended may  may  may  in millions interest income interest expense interest income  net the increase in interest income  net  for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates 
interest expense in fiscal also includes the accretion of interest associated with software license obligations 
the decrease in interest income  net for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower average interest rates on lower average cash balances in fiscal although we generated positive cash flow from operations  our cash balances in fiscal were lower mainly as a result of the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million 
offsetting interest expense was lower during fiscal compared to fiscal as we reduced our outstanding debt 
o other non operating expense  net years ended may  may  may  in millions share in net losses of equity method investments net gain loss on marketable and other investments  net other total other expense  net the components of other non operating expense  net are primarily derived from activities related to our investments 
net gain on investments in fiscal relates to the sale of shares in a nonpublicly traded company 
the share of net losses in equity method investments was lower in fiscal than in fiscal and because we now hold fewer equity method investments in nonpublic companies 
net gain on investments for fiscal was primarily from the sale of shares in two nonpublicly traded companies upon their acquisitions by third parties 
net loss on investments in fiscal was the result of impairment losses for other than temporary declines in fair value of nonmarketable investments that more than offset gains from the sale of marketable investments 
o income tax expense we recorded an income tax benefit of million on income before taxes in fiscal this compares to income tax expense of million in fiscal and income tax expense of million in fiscal while the income before taxes was higher in fiscal than it was in fiscal and  an income tax benefit arose primarily due to the recognition of additional tax benefits that had not been previously recognized 
the annual effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately a percent benefit 
this included fiscal tax expense of million  which consisted of us and us income taxes  offset by a benefit from the change in the beginning of the year valuation allowance of million 
the increase in deferred tax assets during fiscal of million is from a million release of a valuation allowance to equity and benefits of million to continuing operations and million to other comprehensive income 
the deferred tax benefit of million to continuing operations arises from a million change in the beginning of the year valuation allowance and utilization of million of deferred tax assets during fiscal excluding tax effect on other comprehensive income items 
fiscal tax expense consisted primarily of us income tax  net of benefits related to prior period net operating losses and tax credits  and non us income taxes 
the fiscal tax expense represented non us income taxes on international income 
our ability to realize the net deferred tax assets million at may  is primarily dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these tax assets 
because our ability to utilize these tax assets is dependent on future results  it is possible that we will be unable to ultimately realize some portion or all of the benefits of recognized tax assets 
this could result in additions to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and an increase to tax expense 
o foreign operations our foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in the asia pacific region and europe and sales offices throughout the asia pacific region  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities is denominated in local currency  which exposes us to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities during fiscal was concentrated in uk pound sterling  singapore dollar  malaysian ringgit and chinese rmb 
where practical  we hedge net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
our exposure from foreign currency denominated revenue is limited to the japanese yen  pound sterling and the euro 
we hedge up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency  using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is at times hedged using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
at some of our international locations  we maintain defined benefit pension plans that are operated in accordance with local statutes and practices 
as required by the pension accounting standards  we record an adjustment for minimum pension liability to adjust the liability related to one of these plans to equal the amount of the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
for fiscal  the adjustment was million and a corresponding amount  net of a million tax effect  is reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the unfunded benefit obligation decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily because of contributions paid to the plans totaling million 
as we have done in the past  we plan to continue to fund the plan in the future to adequately meet the minimum funding requirements under local statutes 
o financial market risks we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we use derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
due to the short term nature of the major portion of our cash portfolio  a series of severe cuts in interest rates does have a significant impact on the amount of interest income we earn from our cash portfolio 
an increase in interest rates benefits us due to our large net cash position 
an increase in interest rates would not necessarily immediately increase interest expense due to the fixed rates of our existing debt obligations 
a substantial majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen  pound sterling  euro and certain other asian currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established programs to hedge our exposure to these changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change defined as percent in all currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our balances as of may  o liquidity and capital resources years ended may  may  may  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by provided by financing activities the primary factors contributing to the changes in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  and are described below the improvement in net income has been the primary contributor to the increase in cash generated from operating activities in both fiscal and fiscal in fiscal  cash from operating activities was generated primarily from net income  adjusted for noncash items primarily depreciation and amortization  which substantially offset the negative impact that came from changes in working capital components  primarily from decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the decrease in the allowance for receivables in fiscal comes from activity under distributor incentive programs and lower receivables associated with reduced sales levels 
we also generated cash from operating activities in fiscal the positive impact from net income  when adjusted for noncash items primarily depreciation and amortization  was greater than the negative impact from changes in working capital components 
in fiscal  we generated cash from operating activities because the impact from the net loss  adjusted for noncash items primarily depreciation and amortization  was greater than the negative impact from changes in working capital components 
major uses of cash for investing activities during fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million  primarily for the purchase of machinery and equipment  purchases of available for sale securities of million  and payments for security deposits on leased equipment of million 
these were partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of assets associated with the imaging and pc super i o businesses 
major uses of cash for investing activities during fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million  primarily for the purchase of machinery and equipment  net purchases of available for sale securities of million and payments for security deposits on leased equipment of million 
major uses of cash for investing activities for fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million  primarily for machinery and equipment  the acquisition of digitalquake for million  net of cash acquired see note to the consolidated financial statements and investment in nonpublicly traded companies of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the net sale and maturity of marketable securities of million the primary use of cash from our financing activities in fiscal was for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million 
of these shares  million shares were repurchased in the open market for million and the remaining million shares were repurchased through privately negotiated transactions with a major financial institution 
we also used cash to make payments of million on software license obligations and million for cash dividends 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
the primary use of cash from our financing activities in fiscal came from our repurchase of a total of million shares of our common stock for million  net advances of million to acquire our common stock and payments of million on software license obligations 
a portion million shares of the stock repurchase was transacted directly with a major financial institution and the remainder in the open market 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
the primary source of cash from financing activities during fiscal came from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans of million  which was partially offset by payments of million on software license obligations and million for repayment of our outstanding debt balances 
in march  we announced that our board of directors had approved a new million stock repurchase program similar to the previous two programs approved in fiscal the stock repurchase program is consistent with our current business model which focuses on higher value analog products and  therefore  is less capital intensive than it has been historically 
as of may   we had million remaining available for future common stock repurchases under this program 
we also paid cash dividends of million during fiscal in june  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock 
the dividend totaling million was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  we foresee continuing cash outlays for plant and equipment in fiscal  with our primary focus on analog capabilities at our existing sites 
capital expenditures for fiscal were considerably lower than what we typically expect as a result of our efforts to control costs and respond to reduced utilization 
we currently expect fiscal capital expenditures to return to a more typical level and to be higher than the fiscal level 
we will continue to manage the level of capital expenditures in light of sales levels  capacity utilization and industry business conditions 
we expect existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit and cash generated by operations  to be sufficient to finance the planned capital investments in fiscal  as well as the declared dividend and the stock repurchase program 
our cash and investment balances are dependent in part on continued collection of customer receivables and the ability to sell inventories 
although we have not experienced major problems with our customer receivables  significant declines in overall economic conditions could lead to deterioration in the quality of customer receivables 
in addition  major declines in financial markets would most likely cause reductions in our cash equivalents and marketable investments 
the following table provides a summary of the effect on liquidity and cash flows from our contractual obligations as of may  fiscal year and in millions thereafter total contractual obligations debt obligations accrued software license obligations noncancelable operating leases other purchase obligations total commercial commitments standby letters of credit under bank multicurrency agreement in addition  as of may   capital purchase commitments were million 
we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might be established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we do not believe we are materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
o recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on emerging issues task force issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides new guidance for evaluating impairment losses on debt and equity investments  as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
in september  the financial accounting standards board approved the issuance of a fasb staff position which delays the requirement to record impairment losses under eitf the delay applies to all securities within the scope of eitf and is expected to end when new guidance is issued and comes into effect 
pending issuance of new guidance  we have not yet evaluated the requirements of eitf nor determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb  chapter  which amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this statement is the result of a broader effort by the fasb working with the international accounting standards board to reduce differences between us and international accounting standards 
sfas no 
eliminates the so abnormal criterion in arb no 
and companies will no longer be permitted to capitalize inventory costs on their balance sheets when the production defect rate varies significantly from the expected rate 
it also makes clear that fixed overhead should be allocated based on normal capacity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred beginning with our fiscal year we are currently analyzing this statement and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the amendments made by this statement are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
this statement also eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges that occur beginning in our second fiscal period of fiscal and we will apply its provisions prospectively upon adoption 
we currently expect that the adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
this statement is effective beginning with our fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and although we have not yet determined the precise impact to our financial statements and how similar it may be to the amounts currently presented in our pro forma information under the current sfas no 
 we believe the adoption of sfas no 
r will materially increase expenses and reduce profits in the reported results of our operations 
in march  the us securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  which expresses the view of the sec staff regarding the application of sfas no 
r 
sab provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations 
it also provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
the interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of sfas no 
r and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided 
we are currently analyzing staff accounting bulletin no 
to determine the impact of implementation of sfas no 
r 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp provides companies with additional time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the act on their plans for repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we are currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the act  which if implemented by us would affect our tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
however  given the early stage of our evaluation  we are unable to determine the exact amount that may be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation 
based on the analysis to date  however  it is reasonably possible that as much as million could be repatriated  which would then require a corresponding tax liability of up to million 
we expect to be in a position to finalize our analysis by march in march  the financial accounting standards board published fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies that the term  conditional asset retirement obligation  as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation is effective no later than the end of our fiscal we are currently analyzing the interpretation and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement establishes new standards on accounting for changes in accounting principles 
pursuant to the new rules  all such changes must be accounted for by retrospective application to the financial statements of prior periods unless it is impracticable to do so 
this statement replaces apb no 
and sfas no 
 although it carries forward the guidance in those pronouncements with respect to accounting for changes in estimates  changes in the reporting entity and the correction of errors 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in our fiscal year we currently do not expect the adoption of this statement to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
o outlook our business during much of fiscal was affected by a slowdown in order rates  particularly from our distributors 
this was primarily caused by a combination of shorter lead times and excess inventory levels in the supply chain  especially in the first half of the fiscal year 
turns orders in fiscal  which are orders received with delivery requested in the same quarter  were unusually low relative to past history 
however  turns orders were higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal because distributor resales were higher in the fourth quarter and distributor inventories were at much lower levels than a few quarters ago 
total new orders also grew sequentially in the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to the same reasons 
our orders for products in key analog standard linear market areas grew at rates higher than the company s overall average 
historically  order patterns during our first quarter are generally lower than in the preceding fourth quarter due to lower manufacturing activity at our customers that is typical over the summer season  particularly in the european region 
as we ended fiscal  although we saw indications that the excess inventory conditions that persisted for much of the year were largely behind us  the overall economic conditions of the semiconductor industry continued to be difficult to predict 
entering our first quarter of fiscal  we assumed that distributor resales will be flat to slightly down  which is the typical summer pattern based on past years 
we also assumed a drop off in sales due to the sale of our pc super i o business  which was completed in may  and the sale of our cordless business  which was announced in may and completed in june our opening week backlog entering the first quarter of fiscal was slightly higher than it was at the beginning of the previous quarter 
considering all factors  including those discussed above  we provided guidance for net sales in the first quarter of fiscal to be flat to down percent compared to the level achieved in our fiscal fourth quarter  with gross margin percentage to be comparable to the percentage achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal in july  we announced that we plan to close our assembly and test facility in singapore and consolidate its production volume into our other assembly and test facilities in malaysia and china 
the majority of closure activities is expected to take place over the next nine to twelve months 
although we expect some future reduction in our manufacturing costs once the closure is completed  manufacturing costs during the interim may be unfavorably affected 
during fiscal  the american jobs creation act of was signed into law  creating a one time incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
as we are currently evaluating the provision of the act  we have not yet determined its impact to our income tax expense for fiscal if we were to repatriate foreign earnings  we would incur incremental income tax expense for those repatriated amounts 
our overall income tax expense may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures  the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  changes in estimates of credits and deductions  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities  the finalization of various tax returns and changes in our ability to realize deferred tax assets 
o risk factors conditions inherent in the semiconductor industry cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results 
rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new technology leading to more complex and integrated products characterize the semiconductor industry 
the result is a cyclical environment with short product life cycles  price erosion and high sensitivity to the overall business cycle 
although less capital investment is needed for analog products than for many other semiconductor products  substantial capital and r d investment are required to support products and manufacturing processes in the semiconductor industry 
we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future periodic fluctuations in our operating results 
market shifts in product mix toward  or away from  higher margin products can also have a significant impact on our operating results 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
our business will be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully in our markets 
competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
our major competitors include analog devices  linear technology  maxim  st microelectronics and texas instruments 
these companies sell competing products into some of the same markets that we target 
in some cases  we may also compete with our customers 
competition is based on design and quality of products  product performance  price and service  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products  markets and customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 
the wireless handset market continues to drive a significant portion of our overall sales 
new products are being developed to address new features and functionality in handsets  such as color displays  advanced audio  lighting features and battery management that can adequately handle the demands of these advanced features 
due to high levels of competition  as well as complex technological requirements  there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in this targeted market 
although the worldwide handset market is large  near term growth trends are often uncertain and difficult to predict with accuracy 
since the wireless handset market is a consumer market  downturns in the economy that affect consumer demand will impact our business and results 
if our development of new products is delayed or market acceptance is below our expectations  our future operating results may be unfavorably affected 
we believe that continued focused investment in research and development  especially the timely development and market acceptance of new analog products  is a key factor to our successful growth and our ability to achieve strong financial performance 
successful development and introduction of new products are critical to our ability to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace 
we will continue to invest resources to develop more highly integrated solutions and building block products  both primarily based on our analog capabilities 
these products will continue to be targeted towards applications such as wireless handsets  displays  other portable devices and applications in other broad markets that require analog technology 
we cannot assure you that we will develop and introduce successful new products and our failure to bring these products to market may harm our operating results 
we face risks from our international operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our operations outside the united states 
our new assembly and test facility in china that commenced operations in fiscal has expanded our international operations to include china  where we had not previously conducted manufacturing operations 
international operations subject our business to risks associated with many factors beyond our control 
these factors include fluctuations in foreign currency rates  instability of foreign economies  emerging infrastructures in foreign markets  support required abroad for demanding manufacturing requirements  foreign government instability and changes  and us and foreign laws and policies affecting trade and investment 
although we did not experience any materially adverse effects from our foreign operations as a result of these factors in the last year  one or more of these factors has had an adverse effect on us in the past and could adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  although we have a program to hedge our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  our competitive position relative to non us suppliers can be affected by the exchange rate of the non us dollar against other currencies  particularly the japanese yen  euro and pound sterling 
investments  acquisitions and divestitures 
we have made and will continue to consider making strategic business investments  alliances and acquisitions we consider necessary to gain access to key technologies that we believe augment our existing technical capability and support our business model objectives which include gross margin  operating margin  and return on invested capital objectives 
acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties that may unfavorably impact our future financial performance 
we may not be able to integrate and develop the technologies we acquire as expected 
if the technology is not developed in a timely manner  we may be unsuccessful in penetrating target markets 
in addition  with any acquisition there are risks that future operating results may be unfavorably affected by acquisition related costs  including in process r d charges and incremental r d spending 
we have made and will continue to consider making strategic business divestitures 
with any divestiture  there are risks that future operating results could be unfavorably impacted if targeted objectives  such as cost savings  are not achieved or if other business disruptions occur as a result of the divestiture or activities related to the divestiture 
taxes 
from time to time  we have received notices of tax assessments from certain governments of countries in which we operate 
these governments or other government entities may serve future notices of assessments on us and the amounts of these assessments or our failure to favorably resolve such assessments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
current world events 
terrorist activities worldwide and hostilities in and between nation states cause uncertainty on the overall state of the world economy 
we have no assurance that the consequences from these events will not disrupt our operations in the us or other regions of the world in the future 
the emergence of varying illnesses that have the potential for becoming pandemic could also adversely affect our business 
although oil is not a major factor in our cost structure  continued wide fluctuations and large increases in oil prices may affect our future costs and revenues
