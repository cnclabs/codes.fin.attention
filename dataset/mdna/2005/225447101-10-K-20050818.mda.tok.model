item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we develop and manufacture semiconductor materials and electronic devices made from sic  gan and related compounds 
the majority of our products are manufactured at our main production facility in durham  north carolina 
we generate revenues from the following product lines led chips and packaged products we derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of blue  green and near uv led chips 
some of our customers package our blue leds in combination with phosphors to create white leds 
our led chips are packaged by our customers and used by manufacturers as a light source for mobile phones  entertainment devices  indoor and outdoor full color displays  automotive interior lighting  miniature white lights  and other lighting applications 
in fiscal  we released a family of high power packaged leds called our xlamp products that are designed to compete with conventional lighting technology for certain specialty lighting applications 
we currently are marketing these products for use in architectural lighting  appliance lighting  flashlights and reading lamps 
sales of led products represented of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal materials products our customers purchase our sic and gan wafers for use in manufacturing leds and power devices or for research and development 
sales of sic and gan wafers represented of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal we also sell sic materials in bulk crystal form for use in gemstone applications 
sales of sic crystals for use in gemstone applications represented of our revenue for both fiscal and  respectively 
high power products these products include sic power devices  wide bandgap rf and microwave devices and silicon based rf products 
our customers purchase schottky diode products for use in power factor correction circuits for power supplies in computer servers 
we also provide discrete sic rf transistors  as well as a foundry service for wide bandgap mmics  for use in communication applications  high power radar amplifiers  electronic warfare and wireless infrastructure 
sales of power devices and sic based rf devices represented of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal in june  we announced plans to close our silicon based rf and microwave business known as our cree microwave segment that was producing semiconductor components for power amplifiers for analog and digital base stations 
this business  which is located in sunnyvale  california  is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal sales of rf devices from our cree microwave segment represented of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal we also generate revenue under contracts with government agencies 
government entities assist us in the development of new technology by funding our research and development efforts 
revenue from contract research funding represented of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal industry dynamics our business is affected by a number of industry factors  including trends in mobile phone designs and sales  competitive led pricing pressures and the strength of intellectual property that supports our products 
the most significant market currently for our blue and green leds  and white leds made by our customers using our blue chips is for illumination purposes in mobile phones  including lcd backlighting and keypad illumination 
industry publications estimate that overall unit sales of mobile phones for calendar year may increase up to and that the full color adoption rate for mobile phones is expected to increase  but at a slower rate than in the past few years 
led sales for mobile phone applications are impacted by the number of leds used in an application  which may vary depending on trends in the features of the application and the brightness of the leds used 
competitive led pricing pressures in the blue and green industry arise because average led sales prices typically decline each year as new products are introduced in key markets 
table of contents and dominant market players may accelerate this trend by implementing aggressive pricing strategies to strengthen or protect market share 
to remain competitive  led producers generally must reduce the average sales price at or above the market rate 
finally  vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights characterize the semiconductor industry because customers purchasing decisions can be influenced by whether a product is supported by valid intellectual property rights 
highlights and outlook financial highlights from fiscal during fiscal  we reported the highest revenue and earnings in our history 
unit sales increased due to new products focused on high brightness markets 
we continued to face intense competition in our led markets  and as a result our average sales price declined in fiscal we were able to offset lower prices by reducing our average selling costs by due to improved yield and our migration from two inch to three inch wafers  which increased our profitability 
the following is a summary of our financial results we reported our highest annual revenue in fiscal primarily due to our led revenue  which increased while our units sold increased over fiscal revenue from high brightness leds increased from to of total led revenue from fiscal to fiscal we estimate that these products were used mostly for white backlighting for keypads and lcds in mobile phones and for blue and green leds used in gaming applications such as pachinko machines and full color displays 
revenue from our mid brightness chips also increased in fiscal due to the introduction of the ut chip targeting blue keypad backlighting applications for cost sensitive markets 
our gross margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal product costs per unit were lower as a result of yield and process improvements and our manufacturing migration from two inch to three inch wafers that began in the first quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal more than of our led chips were made from three inch wafers 
our net income increased by from fiscal and was the highest in our history at million 
gross profit increased by million due to higher revenue and the successful execution of our cost reduction programs 
research and development expenses increased due to our focus on developing even brighter led chips as well as products for our emerging business areas such as high power packaged leds and power devices 
net income benefited from a lower tax provision rate of due primarily to tax benefits associated with our investment in a public company and other adjustments 
other factors included in the tax provision rate resulted from two offsetting tax adjustments related to the cree microwave subsidiary 
one adjustment was a million favorable permanent tax deduction  which was offset by a million increase in our tax reserve 
we achieved record cash flow from operations of million in fiscal due to higher profitability 
capital expenditures were million 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock under an authorized share repurchase program at a cost of million 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal outlook for fiscal in fiscal  we anticipate that selling blue led chips for white led lamps in mobile phones will continue to be an important growth opportunity 
we also are working to increase the brightness of the xthin family of products 
if we are successful in developing brighter leds  we believe that we will have an opportunity to continue to gain market share in the lcd backlight market for mobile phones that use white leds 
we believe that we currently have low penetration in this particular market due to nichia s dominant share of the market 
with our higher performance xthin chips  we target that white led products packaged by our customers can be as bright or brighter than products sold by nichia  but we must continue to work with our customers to optimize package designs 
based on conversations with our customers  we also believe markets for other high brightness led applications  such as specialty lighting  gaming machine designs  displays and other applications  will continue to grow in fiscal we continue to expand our product offerings of our xlamp family of high power packaged led products 
we are aiming to increase sales of xlamp products in the specialty lighting markets  including channel letters  appliance lights  flashlights and reading lights 
despite the evolving competitive pressures  we expect that our business will increase if we are successful in developing higher performance  low cost led chips 
we believe our proprietary sic platform and vertically integrated factory provides us with the opportunity to lower our cost by scaling to larger sized wafers 
some of our significant challenges for fiscal include increasing the output from our factory in north carolina and our subcontractor s facility in asia  continuing the migration of our led production to three inch wafers and developing brighter xthin and other led products 
we are planning to invest million during fiscal in capital equipment additions to expand our factory output and to improve our yields 
we plan to continue to migrate more of our led production from two inch to three inch sic wafers during fiscal  which we target will greatly increase the number of yielded led chips per wafer and therefore lower our overall led chip cost 
we also are focusing on increasing the brightness for the xthin family of products in fiscal  and we must work with our customers to get these and other products designed into key applications so that we can assist them to gain market share with these products 
we also may increase our research and development spending as a percentage of revenue over our fiscal level 
with the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flows  we also are evaluating strategic investments and relationships to expand and strengthen our product portfolio and to better position us in terms of access to markets and distribution channels 
we do not need these investments to meet our operating goals for fiscal  but we see potential opportunities to accelerate our growth longer term and we plan to actively explore our options
