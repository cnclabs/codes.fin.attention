item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we transferred our axsys product line  our operator training business  and rights to the intellectual property of the hyprotech product line 
the ability of honeywell to compete against our hyprotech engineering product  the loss of our operator training business  the ability of bentley systems to compete against our zyqad product line  and the increased costs of our support obligations to honeywell under the two year support agreement may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the hyprotech engineering products are material to our current business and strategy  and any decrease in our revenues from these products may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
because honeywell may license the hyprotech engineering products on more favorable terms than we may offer  sell the hyprotech engineering products to companies that are customers of both honeywell and us  and bundle the hyprotech engineering products with its other products for the process industries  honeywell may harm our ability to compete in the marketplace  including our ability to negotiate license renewals with our current customers 
in addition  as part of our settlement with kbc advanced technologies  we agreed to recognize kbc s right to develop  market and license hysys 
refinery  kbc s refinery wide simulation product which competes with our refinery wide simulation product  aspen refsys 
as a result of this settlement  increased competition from kbc may harm our market share and our revenues 
in addition  our markets in general are highly competitive 
our engineering software competes with products of other businesses such as abb  aveva group formerly cadcentre  bentley systems  chemstations  mdc technology  process systems enterprise  simulation sciences a division of invensys and winsim formerly chemshare 
our plant operations software competes with products of companies such as abb  honeywell  invensys  osisoft  rockwell  components of sap s offering and siemens 
our supply chain management software competes with products of companies such as honeywell  i technologies  manugistics and components of sap s supply chain offering 
as we expand our engineering solutions into other markets we may face competition from companies that we have not typically competed against in the past or competition from companies in areas where we have not competed in the past  such as abb  agile  eds  honeywell  invensys  parametric technology  sap and siemens 
we also face competition in all areas of our business from large companies in the process industries that have internally developed their own proprietary software solutions 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have established  and may in the future continue to establish  cooperative relationships with third parties to improve their product offerings and to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace 
in addition  competitors may make strategic acquisitions to increase their ability to gain market share or improve the quality or marketability of their products 
these cooperative relationships and strategic acquisitions could reduce our market share  require us to lower our prices  or both 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
if economic conditions and the markets for our products do not continue to improve  sales of our product lines  particularly our manufacturing and supply chain product suites  will be adversely affected 
adverse changes in the economy and global economic and political uncertainty have previously caused delays and reductions in information technology spending by our customers and a consequent deterioration of the markets for our products and services  particularly our manufacturing supply chain product suites 
if adverse economic conditions worsen or do not continue to improve  we will experience further reductions  delays  and postponements of customer purchases that will negatively impact our revenue and operating results 
if economic and political conditions and the market for our products do not continue to improve and our revenues decline  our business could be harmed  and we may not be able to further reduce our costs to align them with these decreased revenues 
if we do not continue to make the technological advances required by the marketplace  our business could be seriously harmed 
enterprises are requiring their application software vendors to provide greater levels of functionality and broader product offerings 
moreover  competitors continue to make rapid technological advances in computer hardware and software technology and frequently introduce new products  services and enhancements 
we must continue to enhance our current product line and develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and the technological developments of our competitors 
our business and operating results could suffer if we cannot successfully respond to the technological advances of others or if our new products or product enhancements and services do not achieve market acceptance 
under our business plan  we are investing significantly in the development of new business process products that are intended to anticipate and meet the emerging needs of our target markets 
we have initiated implementation of a product strategy that would unify our software solutions under the aspenone brand with differentiated aspenone vertical solutions targeted at specific process industries 
we cannot assure you that our new product development will result in products that will meet market needs and achieve significant market acceptance 
if we are unable to successfully market our products to senior executives of potential customers  our revenue growth may be limited 
with the development of our integrated manufacturing supply chain solutions and our eom solutions  we frequently must focus on selling the strategic value of our technology to the highest executive levels of customer organizations  typically the chief executive officer  chief financial officer or chief information officer 
if we are not successful at selling and marketing to senior executives  our revenue growth and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
if we are unable to develop or maintain strategic alliance relationships  our revenue growth may be harmed 
an element of our growth strategy is to establish strategic alliances with a selected third party systems integrators that market and integrate our products 
if our current systems integrators terminate their existing relationships with us  or if we do not adequately train a sufficient number of other systems integrators  or if potential systems integrators focus their efforts on integrating or co selling competing products to the process industries  our future revenue growth could be limited and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
if our systems integrators fail to implement our solutions for our customers properly  the reputations of our products and services and our company could be harmed and we might be subject to claims by our customers 
we intend to continue to establish business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our products and services 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in maintaining our existing relationships and developing new relationships  our revenue growth may be materially and adversely affected 
we may suffer losses on fixed price engagements 
we derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from service engagements and a significant percentage of these engagements have been undertaken on a fixed price basis 
under these fixed price engagements  we bear the risk of cost overruns and inflation  and as a result  any of these engagements may be unprofitable 
in the past  we have had cost overruns on fixed price service engagements 
in addition  to the extent that we are successful in shifting customer purchases to our integrated suites of software and services and we price those engagements on a fixed price basis  the size of our fixed price engagements may increase  which could cause the impact of an unprofitable fixed price engagement to have a more pronounced impact on our operating results 
our business may suffer if we fail to address the challenges associated with international operations 
we derived approximately of our total revenues from customers outside the united states in the fiscal years ended june  and  and approximately of our total revenues from customers outside the united states in the fiscal year ended june  we anticipate that revenues from customers outside the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
our operations outside the united states are subject to additional risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  less effective protection of intellectual property  difficulties in managing distributors and representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  difficulties and delays in translating products and product documentation into foreign languages  difficulties and delays in negotiating software licenses compliant with accounting revenue recognition requirements in the united states  difficulties in collecting trade accounts receivable in other countries  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results cannot be accurately predicted 
in recent years  we have increased the extent to which we denominate arrangements with international customers in the currencies of the countries in which the software or services are provided 
from time to time we have engaged in  and may continue to engage in  hedges of a significant portion of installment contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
any hedging policies implemented by us may not be successful  and the cost of these hedging techniques may have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights  which could make us less competitive and cause us to lose market share 
we regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  license and confidentiality agreements  and software security measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we have registered or have applied to register several of our significant trademarks in the united states and in certain other countries 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and customers  and historically have restricted access to our software products source codes  which we regard as proprietary information 
in a few cases  we have provided copies of the source code for some of our products to customers solely for the purpose of special product customization and have deposited copies of the source code for some of our products in third party escrow accounts as security for ongoing service and license obligations 
in these cases  we rely on non disclosure and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of our technology or independent development by others of technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
any misappropriation of our technology or development of competitive technologies could harm our business  and could force us to incur substantial costs in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
the laws of some countries in which our products are licensed do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
third party claims that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others may be costly to defend or settle and could damage our business 
we cannot be certain that our software and services do not infringe issued patents  copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the software industry  and we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time  including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees concerning their use of our software products and integration technologies and services 
although we believe that our intellectual property rights are sufficient to allow us to market our software without incurring liability to third parties  third parties may bring claims of infringement against us 
because our software is integrated with our customers networks and business processes  as well as other software applications  third parties may bring claims of infringement against us  as well as our customers and other software suppliers  if the cause of the alleged infringement cannot easily be determined 
such claims may be with or without merit 
claims of alleged infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business and may discourage potential customers from doing business with us on acceptable terms  if at all 
defending against claims of infringement may be time consuming and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  including our management s attention to our business 
furthermore  a party making an infringement claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our software or require that we re engineer some or all of our products 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter costly royalty or license agreements 
we may be unable  however  to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed significantly if any of these events occurred  and the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
furthermore  former employers of our current and future employees may assert that our employees have improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us 
in addition  we have agreed  and may agree in the future  to indemnify certain of our customers against claims that our software infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against infringement claims 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we  as well as our customers  may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties  which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required licenses could harm our business  operating results and financial condition and the price of our common stock 
in addition  although we carry general liability insurance  our current insurance coverage may not apply to  and likely would not protect us from  all liability that may be imposed under these types of claims 
because some of our software products incorporate technology licensed from  or provided by  third parties  the loss of our right to use that technology or defects in that third party technology could harm our business 
some of our software products contain technology that is licensed from  or provided by  third parties 
any significant interruption in the supply or support of any such third party software could adversely affect our sales  unless and until we can replace the functionality provided by the third party software 
because some of our software incorporates software developed and maintained by third parties  we depend on these third parties to deliver and support reliable products  enhance our current software  develop new software on a timely and cost effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
in other instances we provide third party software with our current software  and we depend on these third parties to deliver reliable products  provide underlying product support and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
the failure of these third parties to meet these criteria could harm our business 
our software is complex and may contain undetected errors 
like many other complex software products  our software has on occasion contained undetected errors or bugs 
because new releases of our software products are initially installed only by a selected group of customers  any errors or bugs in those new releases may not be detected for a number of months after the delivery of the software 
these errors could result in loss of customers  harm to our reputation  adverse publicity  loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased insurance costs or claims against us by customers 
we may be subject to significant expenses and damages because of liability claims 
the sale and implementation of certain of our software products and services  particularly in the areas of advanced process control and optimization  may entail the risk of product liability claims 
our software products and services are often integrated with our customers networks and software applications and are used in the design  operation and management of manufacturing processes at large facilities  often for mission critical applications 
any errors  defects  performance problems or other failure of our software could result in significant claims against us for damages or for violations of environmental  safety and other laws and regulations 
in addition  the failure of our software to perform to customer expectations could give rise to warranty claims 
our agreements with our customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions in our agreements may not be effective as a result of federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
a substantial product liability claim against us could materially and adversely harm our operating results and financial condition 
even if our software is not at fault  a product liability claim brought against us could be time consuming  costly to defend and harmful to our operations 
in addition  although we carry general liability insurance  our current insurance coverage may be insufficient to protect us from all liability that may be imposed under these types of claims 
implementation of our products can be difficult and time consuming  and customers may be unable to implement our products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to our products 
our products are intended to work with complex business processes 
some of our software  such as customized scheduling applications and integrated supply chain products  must integrate with the existing computer systems and software programs of our customers 
this can be complex  time consuming and expensive 
as a result  some customers may have difficulty in implementing or be unable to implement these products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to these products 
customers may also make claims against us relating to the functionality  performance or implementation of this software 
delayed or ineffective implementation of the software products or related services may limit our ability to expand our revenues and may result in customer dissatisfaction  harm to our reputation and may result in customer unwillingness to pay the fees associated with these products 
if we are not successful in attracting and retaining management team members and other highly qualified individuals in our industry  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership in the highly competitive software market depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial  sales and technical personnel 
we have recently had a number of changes in our senior management 
we announced the resignation of our senior vice president of global sales in august and the resignation of our president and chief executive officer in november  and we also announced the retirement from our board of directors of lawrence b 
evans  our founder who was serving as chairman of our board  in january mark fusco  who became our president and chief executive officer on january   had been serving as a member of our board of directors for one year and has not previously served as the chief executive officer of a publicly traded company 
in addition  several of our executive officers have not entered into employment agreements with us 
in the future  we may experience the departure of senior executives due to competition for talent from start ups and other companies 
our future success depends on a continued  successful management transition and will also depend on our continuing to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in our industry is intense 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act  which became law in july  and new rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq national market have imposed various new requirements on public companies  including requiring changes in corporate governance practices 
our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives 
moreover  these rules and regulations have increased our annual legal and financial compliance costs  have made some activities more time consuming and costly  and could expose us to additional liability 
in our fiscal year ended june   we incurred approximately million in sarbanes oxley related expenses 
in addition  these rules and regulations may make retention and recruitment of qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or executive management more difficult 
we continue to evaluate and monitor regulatory and legislative developments and cannot reliably estimate the timing or magnitude of all costs we may incur as a result of the sarbanes oxley act or other related legislation or regulation 
risks related to our common stock our common stock may experience substantial price and volume fluctuations 
the equity markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in the high technology sector  and those fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  factors such as our financial performance  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  as well as market conditions in the computer software or hardware industries  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a public company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies 
we currently have a putative class action lawsuit pending against us in us district court  district of massachusetts  as described above under we face risks related to securities litigation and investigations that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
our common stockholders may experience further dilution as a result of provisions contained in our outstanding series d convertible preferred stock and warrants 
the terms of our outstanding securities may result in substantial dilution to existing common stockholders 
in august  we issued  shares of series d convertible preferred stock  or series d preferred  and delivered cash and  shares of series d convertible preferred stock  or series d preferred  in consideration for the surrender of all of our outstanding series b i and b ii convertible preferred stock  or series b preferred 
each share of our series d preferred and series d preferred  which we refer to collectively as series d preferred  is currently convertible  at the holder s option  into shares of our common stock and may be converted into additional shares of our common stock upon certain events as a result of antidilution provisions in our charter 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  which we refer to as the wd warrants  and exchanged existing warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  which we refer to as the wb warrants 
the wd warrants and wb warrants are currently exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and may be converted into additional shares upon certain events as a result of antidilution provisions in the warrants 
the series d preferred  together with the wd warrants and wb warrants  were issued to several investment partnerships managed by advent international corporation and to holders of our series b preferred 
we refer to these transactions as the series d financing 
in addition to the series d preferred and the wd and wb warrants  we currently have additional warrants outstanding that are exercisable to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and  shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
our common stockholders would be subject to substantial dilution if the series d preferred is converted into common stock or if our outstanding warrants are exercised for common stock 
each share of series d preferred is entitled to a cumulative dividend of of the stated value per share of such series d preferred per year  payable at the discretion of the board of directors or upon conversion of the series d preferred to common stock or redemption of the series d preferred 
accumulated dividends  when and if declared by our board  could be paid in cash or  subject to specified conditions  common stock 
if we elect to pay dividends in shares of common stock  we will issue a number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the dividend payment by the volume weighted average of the sale prices of the common stock on the nasdaq national market for consecutive trading days  ending on the fourth trading day prior to the required dividend payment date 
we are obligated to register for public sale shares of common stock issuable pursuant to our outstanding series d preferred and warrants  and sales of those shares may result in a decrease in the price of our common stock 
we have granted rights to require that we register under the securities act the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of  or as dividends on  the series d preferred and upon the exercise of either the wb warrants or wd warrants series d preferred 
the holders of the series d preferred have the right to demand that we file on their behalf up to four registration statements covering shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion of the series d preferred and b exercise of the wd warrants issued to the holders of the series d preferred 
series d preferred 
we previously filed a registration statement that covers all of the shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion of the series d preferred and b exercise of the wb and wd warrants issued to the initial holders of the series d preferred 
in addition  to the extent we elect to pay dividends on the series d preferred in shares of our common stock  we are required to register such shares 
any sale of common stock into the public market by the holders of the series d preferred pursuant to a registration statement could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
we may need to raise capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect that our current cash balances  cash equivalents  short term investments  proceeds from the anticipated increased sale of installment contracts  funds available under our bank line of credit  and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to obtain additional financing thereafter or earlier  however  if our current plans and projections prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of lower than expected revenues  fewer sales of installment contracts  unanticipated expenses  including those related to the class action lawsuits or their outcome or settlement  or other unforeseen difficulties 
our sales of receivables are an important part of our cash management program 
we currently have arrangements to sell long term contracts to three financial institutions  general electric capital corporation  bank of america and silicon valley bank 
these contracts represent amounts due over the life of existing term licenses 
under the three arrangements  we sold installments receivable of million during the fiscal year ended june  in addition  on june   we securitized outstanding installment software license receivables totaling million 
such securitization was structured in manner so that the securitization qualified as a sale 
we received million of cash and retained an interest in the sold receivables valued at million 
the proceeds of this transaction were used to retire a portion of our convertible subordinated debentures due june   which we refer to as the convertible debentures 
during the fiscal year ended june   our installments receivable balance decreased to million at june  from million at june  our ability to continue these arrangements or replace them with similar arrangements is important to maintain adequate funding 
if there is insufficient interest from third parties in purchasing our installments receivable contracts  our ability to generate cash required to meet our financial obligations may be impaired 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations through the sales of our installments receivable contracts  we may be required to incur additional indebtedness or raise additional capital 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
in addition  the uncertain outcome of the class action lawsuit impairs our ability to obtain additional financing 
until this lawsuit is resolved  or if any resolution is materially adverse to us  we expect our ability to obtain additional financing will be substantially impaired 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  reduce or defer our development activities  or delay our introduction of new products and services 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results 
the holders of our series d preferred and wb and wd warrants own a substantial portion of our capital stock that may afford them significant influence over our affairs 
as of june   the series d preferred as converted to common stock represented of our outstanding common stock and the wb and wd warrants were exercisable for a number of shares representing of our outstanding common stock ignoring certain limitations on the ability to convert such shares or exercise such warrants 
as a result  the holders of the series d preferred and the wb and wd warrants  if acting together  would have the ability to delay or prevent a change in control of our company that may be favored by other stockholders and otherwise exercise significant influence over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote  including any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  the approval of some mergers and other significant corporate transactions  including a sale of substantially all of our assets  or the defeat of any non negotiated takeover attempt that might otherwise benefit the public stockholders 
in addition  the holders of the series d preferred have elected three of our non employee board members 
accordingly  the holders of our series d preferred may be able to exert substantial influence over matters submitted for board approval 
our corporate documents and provisions of delaware law may prevent a change in control or management that stockholders may consider desirable 
section of the delaware general corporation law and our charter and by laws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of our company or a change in our management that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item properties our principal offices occupy approximately  square feet of office space in cambridge  massachusetts 
the lease of this office space expires on september  we have agreements to sub lease approximately  square feet of this space that expire throughout we are actively seeking to sub lease an additional  square feet of this space 
we also lease space for our houston  texas facilities 
this lease encompasses approximately  square feet and expires in july in addition to these two facilities we and our subsidiaries also lease office space in gaithersburg  maryland  lawrenceville  new jersey  new providence  new jersey  midlothian  virginia  bothell  washington  buenos aires  argentina  lahulpe  belgium  sao paulo  brazil  calgary  alberta  canada  beijing  china  cambridge  england  warrington  england  dusseldorf  germany  wiesbaden  germany  pune  india  pisa  italy  tokyo  japan  kuala lumpur  malaysia  mexico city  mexico  best  the netherlands  singapore  seoul  south korea  barcelona  spain  and other locations where additional sales and customer support offices are located 
we believe that our existing and planned facilities are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future and that  if additional space is needed  such space will be available on acceptable terms 
item legal proceedings us attorney s office investigation on october   we announced that we had received a subpoena from the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york requesting documents relating to transactions to which we were a party during to  associated documents dating from january   and additional materials 
we have cooperated fully with the subpoena requests and in the investigation by the us attorney s office

we believe that plaintiffs claims lack merit and intend to litigate the dispute vigorously 
we are currently unable to determine whether resolution of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations  or reasonably estimate the amount of the loss  if any  that may result from resolution of these matters 
however  the ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

we moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to fed

we are currently unable to determine whether resolution of this matter will have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations  or reasonably estimate the amount of the loss  if any  that may result from resolution of this matter 
however  the ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition for both software licenses and fixed fee consulting services  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets  accrual of legal fees associated with outstanding litigation  accounting for income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  and accounting for securitization of installments receivable 
revenue recognition software licenses we recognize software license revenue in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
and sop no 
 as well as the various interpretations and clarifications of those statements 
these statements require that four basic criteria must be satisfied before software license revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between ourselves and a third party exists  delivery of our product has occurred  the sales price for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the sales price is probable 
our management uses its judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria  particularly the criteria relating to the determination of whether the fee is fixed and determinable and the criteria relating to the collectibility of the receivables  particularly the installments receivable  relating to such sales 
in addition  our management uses its judgment in applying these two criteria to reseller transactions where  specifically  revenue is only recognized upon delivery to the end user  since the determination of whether the fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection if probable is more difficult 
should changes and conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  all or substantially all of the software license revenue recognized for such transactions could be deferred 
revenue recognition fixed fee consulting services we recognize revenue associated with fixed fee service contracts in accordance with the proportional performance method  measured by the percentage of costs primarily labor incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs primarily labor for each contract 
when a loss is anticipated on a contract  the full amount of the anticipated loss is provided currently 
our management uses its judgment concerning the estimation of the total costs to complete the contract  considering a number of factors including the experience of the personnel that are performing the services and the overall complexity of the project 
we have a significant amount of experience in the estimation of the total costs to complete a contract and have not typically recorded material losses related to these estimates 
we do not expect the accuracy of our estimates to change significantly in the future 
should changes and conditions cause actual results to differ significantly from management s estimates  revenue recognized in future periods could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review the carrying value of long lived assets when circumstances dictate that they should be reevaluated  based upon the expected future operating cash flows of our business 
these future cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions  and are continuously reviewed based on actual operating trends 
historically  actual results have occasionally differed from our estimated future cash flow estimates 
in the future  actual results may differ materially from these estimates  and accordingly cause a full impairment of our long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we conduct at least an annual assessment on january st of the carrying value of our goodwill assets 
we obtain a third party valuation of the reporting units associated with the goodwill assets  which is based on either estimates of future income from the reporting units or estimates of the market value of the units  based on comparable recent transactions 
these estimates of future income are based upon historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions  and are continuously reviewed based on actual operating trends 
historically  actual results have occasionally differed from our estimated future cash flow estimates 
in the future  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
in addition  the relevancy of recent transactions used to establish market value for our reporting units is based on management s judgment 
during the year ended june   we recorded million in charges related to the impairment of certain long lived assets and technology related intangible and computer software development assets 
the timing and size of future impairment charges involves the application of management s judgment and estimates and could result in the impairment of all or substantially all of our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  which totaled million as of june  accrual of legal fees associated with outstanding litigation we accrue estimated future legal fees associated with outstanding litigation for which management has determined that it is probable that a loss contingency exists 
this requires management to estimate the amount of legal fees that will be incurred in the defense of the litigation 
these estimates are based heavily on our expectations of the scope  length to complete and complexity of the claims 
historically  as these factors have changed after our original estimates  we have adjusted our estimates accordingly 
in the future  additional adjustments may be recorded as the scope  length or complexity of outstanding litigation changes 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with the assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
tax assets also result from net operating losses  research and development tax credits and foreign tax credits 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  the impact will be included in the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against these amounts 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could result in a tax provision equal to the carrying value of our deferred tax assets 
during the year ended june   we recorded a million valuation allowance against our us domiciled net deferred tax assets 
this charge  however  had no impact on our cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables for which collection is doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
in determining these provisions  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be required for all or substantially all of certain receivable balances 
accounting for securitization of installments receivable we made judgments with respect to several variables associated with our june securitization transaction that had a significant impact on the valuation of our retained interest in the sold receivables  as well as the calculation of the loss on the transaction 
these judgments include the discount rate used to value the retained interest in the sold receivables and estimates of rates of default 
in determining these factors  we looked at comparable transactions with respect to fair market discount rates  and analyzed our historical collection experience to default rates and collection timing 
if the historical collection data do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  an impairment of a substantial portion of our retained interest may result 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended june  revenues software licenses service and other total revenues cost of revenues cost of software licenses cost of service and other amortization of technology related intangible assets impairment of technology related intangible and computer software development assets total cost of revenues gross margin operating costs selling and marketing research and development general and administrative long lived asset impairment charges restructuring charges and ftc legal costs loss gain on sales and disposals of assets total operating costs income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes and equity in earnings from joint ventures comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues 
revenues are derived from software licenses  consulting services and maintenance and training 
total revenues for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the geographical mix of revenues can vary from period to period 
software license revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal software license revenues are attributable to software license renewals covering existing users  the expansion of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products  and  to a lesser extent  to the addition of new customers 
we believe that the decrease was primarily due to distractions caused by the ongoing uncertainty of the ftc proceedings  our audit committee investigation  changes in sales management and delays in purchasing from customers 
revenues from service and other consist of consulting services  post contract support on software licenses  training and sales of documentation 
revenues from service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal these decreases were attributable primarily to the consulting services business 
consulting services decreased due to the general low level of licenses of our supply chain products during the two most recent fiscal years 
our consulting services are more heavily linked to the implementation of our supply chain products than they are to our other products 
we believe that the decrease was also due to distractions caused by the ongoing uncertainty of the ftc proceedings and our audit committee investigation 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists of royalties  amortization of previously capitalized software costs  costs related to delivery of software  including disk duplication and third party software costs  printing of manuals and packaging 
cost of software licenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the cost increase is primarily due to an increase in amortization of computer software development costs of million 
the increase in the amortization of computer software development costs is related to several significant product releases  including aspenone in december cost of service and other 
cost of service and other consists of the cost of execution of application consulting services  technical support expenses and the cost of training services 
cost of service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal cost of service and other  as a percentage of revenues from service and other  increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in cost is primarily due to decreased payroll costs of million related to reductions in headcount  as well as a decrease in reimbursable expenses of million 
amortization of technology related intangible assets 
amortization of technology related intangible assets consists of the amortization from intangible assets obtained in acquisitions 
these assets are generally being amortized over a period of three to five years 
amortization expense for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  while increasing as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decrease in cost is primarily due to a decrease in payroll and benefit costs of million attributable to the headcount reductions effected in the june restructuring plan  offset by an increase in advertising costs of million related to aspenworld  which took place in october research and development 
research and development expenses consist of personnel and outside consultancy costs required to conduct our product development efforts 
research and development expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in salary and benefit costs and a million decrease in facilities related costs associated with the june restructuring plan  and a million decrease in consulting costs 
we capitalized software development costs that amounted to of our total research and development costs during fiscal  as compared to in fiscal these percentages will vary from quarter to quarter  depending upon the stage of development for the various projects in a given period 
this increase is primarily due to the significant amount of effort associated with the development and release of aspenone in december and aspenone in may general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of administrative  executive  financial and legal personnel  and outside professional fees 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
this increase is due to a million increase in legal  accounting and consulting costs associated with the internal investigation by the audit committee  million in litigation defense and settlement costs related to kbc  a million increase in audit and consulting fees associated with the sarbanes oxley act  specifically our section efforts  and million in contract and employment termination costs 
long lived asset impairment charges 
in fiscal  this amount consisted of million in impairment charges based on our decision to discontinue certain internal capital projects that had previously been put on hold 
in addition  certain fixed assets that supported research and development efforts were considered impaired as a result of the product consolidation decisions made in the april product review 
restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
of this amount  million related to headcount reductions and facility consolidations associated with the june restructuring plan that did not qualify for accrual at june   million related to the may restructuring charge  million related to the accretion of discounted restructuring accruals  and million related to adjustments to prior restructuring accruals  all offset by million in legal costs related to the ftc challenge of our acquisition of hyprotech 
in may  we initiated a plan to consolidate several corporate functions and to reduce our operating expenses 
the plan to reduce operating expenses primarily resulted in headcount reductions  and also included the termination of a contract and the consolidation of facilities 
these actions resulted in an aggregate restructuring charge of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the components of the restructuring plan are as follows closure consolidation of facilities approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the termination of a facility lease 
the facility lease had a remaining term of two years 
the amount accrued is an estimate of the remaining obligation under the lease  reduced by expected income from the sublease of the underlying properties 
employee severance  benefits and related costs approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the reduction in headcount 
approximately employees  or of the workforce  were eliminated under the restructuring plan 
the employees were primarily located in north america and europe 
all business units were affected  including services  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
contract termination costs approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to charges associated with the termination of a contract for a future user conference 
the contract was terminated in june loss gain on sales of assets 
loss gain on sales of assets was a million loss in fiscal as compared to million gain in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the loss of million incurred on the securitization of installments receivable 
interest income 
interest income is generated from investment of excess cash and from the license of software pursuant to installment contracts 
under these installment contracts  we offer a customer the option to make annual payments for its term licenses instead of a single license fee payment at the beginning of the license term 
historically  a substantial majority of the asset optimization customers have elected to license these products through installment contracts 
included in the annual payments is an implicit interest rate established by us at the time of the license 
as we sell more perpetual licenses for value chain solutions  these sales are being paid for in forms that are generally not installment contracts 
if the mix of sales moves away from installment contracts  interest income in future periods will be reduced 
we sell a portion of the installment contracts to unrelated financial institutions 
the interest earned by us on the installment contract portfolio in any one year is the result of the implicit interest rate established by us on installment contracts and the size of the contract portfolio 
interest income was million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease primarily is due to the increased sale of receivables and lower license revenues  resulting in the decrease of installments receivable balance 
interest expense 
interest expense was incurred under our convertible debentures  amounts owed to accenture  and capital lease obligations 
interest expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease in interest expense results from the elimination of interest bearing debt  such as the retirement of a portion of the convertible debentures in january  march and may  and the retirement of the remaining portion in june foreign currency exchange gain loss 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily incurred through the revaluation of receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
in fiscal we recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of million  compared to a million gain in fiscal this increase was due to favorable exchange rate fluctuations and effective hedging of foreign receivable balances 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal  primarily related to foreign taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal the provision for fiscal includes a million valuation allowance against us domiciled net deferred tax assets and a million provision primarily related to foreign taxes 
additionally  as part of a change in the japan us tax treaty  the japanese withholding tax law was repealed effective july  and provided approximately million of income tax relief to the company as of the enactment date of the tax law change which occurred in the quarter ended march  we provided a full valuation allowance against the net operating losses generated during fiscal and under sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset related to the future benefit of a tax loss carryforward should be recorded unless we make a determination that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset would not be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance would be provided against the deferred tax asset to the extent that we cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
in determining the amount of valuation allowance required  we consider numerous factors  including historical profitability  estimated future taxable income  the volatility of the historical earnings  and the volatility of earnings of the industry in which we operate 
we periodically review our deferred tax asset to determine if such asset is realizable 
in fiscal  we concluded  in accordance with sfas no 
 that we should record a valuation allowance on a significant portion of our deferred tax asset under the more likely than not test and therefore increased the amount of the valuation allowance 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
equity in earnings from joint ventures 
equity in earnings from joint ventures was a million loss in fiscal these losses relate to net losses incurred by certain joint ventures in which we have an equity interest 
these investments were liquidated during fiscal  and there were no material gains or losses realized

total revenues for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
software license revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to a modest decrease in demand for products from our engineering product line 
revenues from service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal this decrease is attributable primarily to the consulting services business 
consulting services decreased due to a year over year million decline in reimbursable expenses  and due to the general low level of licenses of our manufacturing supply chain products during the two most recent fiscal years 
our consulting services are more heavily linked to the implementation of our manufacturing supply chain products than they are to our engineering products 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the cost increase is primarily due to an increase in royalty costs of million and amortization of computer software development costs of million 
the increase in royalties is attributable to higher license revenues and the increase in the amortization of computer software development costs is due to two significant product releases  aes and ams  during the first part of this fiscal year 
cost of service and other 
cost of service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal cost of service and other  as a percentage of revenues from service and other  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in cost is primarily due to decreased payroll costs of million related to reductions in headcount  as well as a decrease in reimbursable expenses of million 
the costs of service and other as a percentage of service and other revenues are generally consistent from period to period  showing a modest decrease as our utilization rates have increased 
amortization of technology related intangible assets 
amortization expense for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the discontinued amortization of million of intangible assets for which an impairment was recorded in the three months ended december  impairment of technology related intangible and computer software development assets 
impairment of technology related intangible and computer software development assets consists of impairment charges related to assets that are directly involved in the production of revenue 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to management s decision to discontinue development of certain next generation manufacturing supply chain products 
management s decision was based on concerns about the future revenue projections for these products  and the assessment of costs remaining to bring these products to market 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to computer software development costs and intangible assets that were related to products that management either decided would not be sold or determined that their carrying values were in excess of their fair values 
the assets that will no longer be used were identified by management s decisions to discontinue future development efforts associated with certain products 
the carrying values of the remaining assets were compared to the fair values of those assets resulting in an impairment 
the fair values were determined by forecasting the future net cash flows associated with the products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  while decreasing as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in advertising costs of million related to aspenworld  which took place in fiscal  and a decrease in payroll and benefit costs of million attributable to the headcount reductions effected in the october restructuring plan 
research and development 
research and development expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in depreciation and amortization related to assets written off in december  a million decrease in salary and benefit costs associated with the reductions in headcount from the october restructuring plan  a million decrease in consulting costs  and a million decrease in travel costs 
we capitalized software development costs that amounted to of our total research and development costs during fiscal  as compared to in fiscal these percentages will vary from quarter to quarter  depending upon the stage of development for the various projects in a given period 
this decrease is primarily due to the completion of product development activity related to two significant product releases during the first part of fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
this increase is due to a million increase in legal costs associated with legal defense and loss contingencies associated with the kbc litigation and with the settlement of other litigation 
this is offset by a million decrease in salary and benefit costs associated with the reductions in headcount from the october restructuring plan 
long lived asset impairment charges 
in fiscal  this amount consisted of million in impairment charges based on our decision to discontinue certain internal capital projects that had previously been put on hold 
in addition  certain fixed assets that supported research and development efforts were considered impaired as a result of the product consolidation decisions made in the april product review 
in october  we determined that the goodwill should be tested for impairment as a result of lowered revenue expectations and the overall decline in our market value 
this amounted to a million aggregate impairment charge  recorded in the fiscal consolidated statement of operations 
concurrent with the goodwill impairment review  we determined that several other assets were also impaired 
this resulted in an additional million in impairment charges in fiscal  related to the intellectual property purchased from accenture in february  internal capital projects and fixed assets 
restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
of this amount  million is associated with a june restructuring plan  which is offset by million in adjustments to prior restructuring accruals and deferred rent balances  and million consists of legal costs related to the ftc challenge of our acquisition of hyprotech 
in june  we initiated a plan to reduce our operating expenses in order to better align our expense structure with the current economic environment and to improve our operating margins 
this plan coincided with a reduction in our revenue projections for fiscal the plan to reduce operating expenses resulted in the consolidation of facilities  headcount reductions  and the termination of operating contracts 
these actions resulted in an aggregate restructuring charge of million 
this is offset by million in adjustments to the prior restructuring accruals and deferred rent balances  primarily related to the buy out of the remaining obligation for our houston  texas facility  of which portions had previously been vacated and included in previous restructuring plans 
the components of the restructuring plan are as follows closure consolidation of facilities approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the termination of facility leases and other lease related costs 
the facility leases had remaining terms ranging from several months to eight years 
the amount accrued is an estimate of the remaining obligation under the lease or actual costs to buy out leases  reduced by expected income from the sublease of the underlying properties 
employee severance  benefits and related costs approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the reduction in headcount 
approximately employees  or of the workforce  were eliminated under the restructuring plan 
a majority of the employees were located in north america  although europe was affected  as well 
all business units were affected  including services  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
impairment of assets approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to charges associated with the impairment of fixed assets associated with the closed consolidated facilities 
these assets were reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 and were considered to be impaired because their carrying values were in excess of their fair values 
the fair values were determined based on a quoted market price from a third party 
loss gain on sales of assets 
loss gain on sales of assets was a million gain in fiscal as compared to million gain in fiscal this increase is due primarily to a million gain on the sale of receivables and a million gain on the sale of land in houston  texas in fiscal interest income 
interest income was million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease primarily is due to the aggressive collection of receivables and the increased sale of receivables  resulting in the decrease of installments receivable balance 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease in interest expense results from the elimination of interest bearing debt  such as the payment of the obligation to accenture in august and the repurchase and retirement of a portion of the convertible debentures in september  january  march and may foreign currency exchange gain loss 
in fiscal we recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of million  compared to a million loss in fiscal this increase was due to favorable exchange rate fluctuations and effective hedging of foreign receivable balances 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal the provision for fiscal includes a million valuation allowance against us domiciled net deferred tax assets and a million provision primarily related to foreign taxes 
additionally  as part of a change in the japan us tax treaty  the japanese withholding tax law was repealed effective july  and provided approximately million of income tax relief to the company as of the enactment date of the tax law change which occurred in the quarter ended march  we provided a full valuation allowance against the net operating losses generated during fiscal and equity in earnings from joint ventures 
equity in earnings from joint ventures was a million loss in fiscal as compared to a million loss in fiscal these losses relate to net losses incurred by certain joint ventures in which we have an equity interest 
quarterly results our operating results and cash flow have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  including purchasing patterns  timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements by us and our competitors  and fluctuating economic conditions 
because license fees for our software products are substantial and the implementation of our solutions often involve the services of engineers over an extended period of time  the sales process for our solutions is lengthy and can exceed one year 
accordingly  software revenues are difficult to predict  and the delay of any order could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below expectations 
moreover  to the extent that we succeed in shifting customer purchases away from point solutions and toward integrated solutions  the likelihood of delays in ordering may increase and the effect of any delay may become more pronounced 
we ship software products within a short period after receipt of an order and usually do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders of software products 
consequently  revenues from software licenses  including license renewals  in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has been derived from license agreements that have been consummated in the final weeks of the quarter 
therefore  even a short delay in the consummation of an agreement may cause revenues to fall below expectations for that quarter 
since our expense levels are based in part on anticipated revenues  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall and any revenue shortfall would likely have a disproportionately adverse effect on net income 
we expect that these factors will continue to affect our operating results for the foreseeable future

in fiscal and  operating activities provided million and million of cash  respectively 
in fiscal  investing activities used million of cash primarily as a result of the capitalization of computer software development costs and the ordinary purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of a building in june in fiscal and  investing activities provided million of cash and used million of cash  respectively 
in fiscal  financing activities used million of cash primarily due to payment made to retire all of the outstanding principal amount of our convertible debentures  partially offset by by the proceeds from a securitization transaction  exercise of stock options and issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal and  financing activities used million of cash and provided million of cash  respectively 
historically  we have financed our operations principally through cash generated from public offerings of our convertible debentures and common stock  private offerings of our preferred stock and common stock  operating activities  and the sale of installment contracts to third parties 
on june   we paid million to retire all of the outstanding principal amount of our convertible debentures  together with interest accrued thereon 
we funded this payment with a million of our existing cash  b million obtained from our sales of installments receivable under our existing receivables programs with silicon valley bank and ge capital corporation  and c million through the sale of additional installments receivable under the arrangement described below 
on june   we securitized outstanding installment software license receivables totaling million 
such securitization was structured in manner so that the securitization qualified as a sale 
we received million of cash and retained an interest in the sold receivables valued at million 
we also retained certain limited recourse obligations relative to the receivables valued at approximately million 
overall  the transaction including million in aggregate fees and expenses  including fees of the lenders agent and fees of our outside legal counsel and financial advisors resulted in a loss of million in the quarter ended june  and was recorded as a loss on sales and disposals of assets 
we expect that we would have received approximately million  million and million of cash flows from these installments receivable during fiscal years  and  if not for the securtization of the receivables 
in august  we issued and sold  shares of series d preferred  along with wd warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
concurrently  we paid million and issued  shares of series d preferred  along with wb and wd warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  to repurchase all of the outstanding series b preferred 
the series d preferred earns cumulative dividends at an annual rate of  that are payable when and if declared by the board  in cash or  subject to certain conditions  common stock 
each share of series d preferred currently is convertible into shares of common stock  subject to anti dilution and other adjustments 
as a result  the shares of series d preferred currently are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the series d preferred is subject to redemption at the option of the holders as follows on or after august  and on or after august  we have had arrangements to sell installments receivable to three financial institutions  general electric capital corporation  bank of america and silicon valley bank 
we sold certain installment contracts for aggregate proceeds of approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
as of june   there was approximately million in additional availability under the arrangements 
we expect to continue to have the ability to sell receivables  as the collection of the sold receivables will reduce the outstanding balance  and the availability under the arrangements can be increased 
at june   we had a partial recourse obligation that was within the range of million to million 
in january  we executed a loan arrangement with silicon valley bank 
this arrangement provides a line of credit of up to the lesser of million or of eligible domestic receivables  and a line of credit of up to the lesser of million or of eligible foreign receivables 
the lines of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate at june  plus 
we are required to maintain a million compensating cash balance with the bank  or be subject to an unused line fee and collateral handling fees 
the lines of credit will initially be collateralized by nearly all of our assets  and upon achieving certain net income targets  the collateral will be reduced to a lien on our accounts receivable 
we are required to meet certain financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  minimum cash balances and an adjusted quick ratio 
as of june   there were million in letters of credit outstanding under the line of credit  and there was million available for future borrowing 
as of june   we were in default of the tangible net worth and adjusted quick ratio covenants 
on september   we executed an amendment to the loan arrangement that adjusted the terms of the financial covenants and cured the default as of june  the loan arrangement expires in july as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
our commitments as of june  consisted of debt obligations and leases for our headquarters and other facilities 
other than these  there were no other commitments for capital or other expenditures 
our obligations related to these items at june  are as follows in thousands thereafter total operating leases debt obligations total commitments we believe our current cash balances  together with availability of sales of our installment contracts and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least fiscal however  we may need to obtain additional financing thereafter or earlier  if our current plans and projections prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties 
in addition  we may seek to take advantage of favorable market conditions by raising additional funds from time to time through public or private security offerings  debt financings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
they may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  reduce or defer our development activities  or delay our introduction of new products and services 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operating results to date and we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact during fiscal new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r is effective for our first annual reporting period that begins after june  we expect to adopt sfas no 
r using its modified prospective application method 
adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to increase stock compensation expense 
assuming the continuation of current programs  our preliminary estimate is that additional stock compensation expense for fiscal will be in the range of million to million 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires that the excess tax benefits related to stock compensation be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash from operations

the translation of our foreign entities assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results 
foreign exchange forward contracts are only obtained to hedge certain customer installments receivable amounts or obligations denominated in a foreign currency 
foreign exchange hedging we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on customer installments receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
the objective of these contracts is to limit the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement on our operating results 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we had million of foreign exchange forward contracts denominated in japanese  british  swiss  canadian and euro currencies which represented underlying customer installments receivable transactions at the end of fiscal the underlying customer installments receivable transactions consist of assets carried on our balance sheet and assets that were transferred to our subsidiary as part of the securitization of installments receivable  for which we have assumed the exposure associated with changes in foreign exchange rates 
at each balance sheet date  the foreign exchange forward contracts and the related installments receivable denominated in foreign currencies are revalued based on the current market exchange rates 
resulting gains and losses are included in earnings or deferred as a component of other comprehensive income 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
gains and losses related to these instruments for fiscal were not material to our financial position
