item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions  as set forth under special note regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth in the following discussion and under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an online closeout retailer offering discount brand name merchandise  including bed and bath goods  furniture  kitchenware  watches  jewelry  computers and electronics  sporting goods  apparel and designer accessories and travel 
our company  based in salt lake city  utah  was founded in  and we launched our first website through which customers could purchase products in march our revenue is comprised of direct revenue and fulfillment partner revenue 
direct revenue includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses  which are fulfilled from our warehouse in salt lake city  utah or our outsourced warehouse located in plainfield  indiana  and sales from our warehouse store which we closed in january customers place orders through our main website  www 
overstock 
com 
although we historically operated a separate business to business bb website  our direct revenue has predominantly been based on purchases made directly through our main consumer website 
as a result  during the third quarter of  we integrated the bb website into our consumer website  and bb clients now buy products primarily through our club o frequent buyers club and our club o gold bulk purchase program 
during  safeway  inc accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
however  our relationship with safeway terminated in february during  no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenue 
our fulfillment partner revenue is generated when we sell merchandise of other retailers  cataloguers or manufacturers fulfillment partners through our website 
prior to july   we did not own or physically handle the merchandise we sold in these transactions  as the merchandise was shipped directly by a third party vendor  which also handled all customer returns related to those sales 
beginning july   we took responsibility for returned items relating to these sales and we now handle the resale of returned items 
as a result  beginning july   we are considered to be the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions  and we assume the risk of loss on returned items 
as a consequence  we now record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions involving our fulfillment partners excluding auction and travel products on a gross basis  rather than on a net basis as we did prior to july  similar to our direct segment  fulfillment partner products are available to both consumers and businesses through our club o frequent buyers club initiative and our club o gold bulk purchase initiative 
our use of the term partner or fulfillment partner does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our fulfillment partners 
during september  we added an online auction service to our website 
our auction service allows sellers to list items for sale  buyers to bid on items of interest  and users to browse through listed items online 
we are not the seller of the items sold on the auction site and we have no control over the pricing of those items 
therefore  for auctions  we record only our listing fees for items listed and commissions for items sold as revenue 
unless otherwise indicated or required by the context  the discussion herein of our financial statements  accounting policies and related matters pertains to our shopping site and not necessarily to our auction site 
revenue from our auctions business is included in the fulfillment partner segment in  as it is not material 
during the first quarter of  we reopened our discount travel store to our website  currently offering cruise packages 
in the future  we intend to offer other travel products such as flight  hotel  and rental car reservations 
for the products or services that we sell in our travel store  we do not currently have inventory risk or pricing control  and do not directly provide customer service 
therefore  for these sales we are not considered to be the primary obligor  and record only our commission as revenue 
our revenue is recorded net of returns  coupons and other discounts 
subject to some limitations  our returns policy for products other than those sold in our electronics and computers department provides for a restocking fee and the provision that we will not accept product returns initiated more than days after the shipment date 
we charge a restocking fee instead of the restocking fee on items returned for non defective reasons from the electronics and computers department 
cost of goods sold consists of the cost of the product  as well as inbound and outbound freight and fulfillment costs 
fulfillment costs include warehouse handling labor costs  fixed warehouse costs  credit card fees and customer service costs 
fulfillment costs represented  and of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  as noted in the following table in thousands year ended december  total revenue    cost of goods sold product costs and other cost of goods sold   fulfillment costs    total cost of goods sold    gross profit    this table has been included to provide investors additional information regarding our classification of fulfillment costs and gross margins  thus enabling investors to better compare our fulfillment costs and gross margins with others in our industry 
we believe that some companies in our industry  including some of our competitors  account for fulfillment costs within operating expenses  and therefore exclude fulfillment costs from gross margins 
as a result  our gross margins may not be directly comparable to others in our industry 
our gross margins on sales through our club o frequent buyers club  our club o gold bulk purchases program and our bmv products tend to be lower than margins on our other sales  and our overall gross margins will be impacted by the blend of club o  club o gold  and bmv sales as a percentage of our total revenue 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising  public relations and promotional expenditures  as well as payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities 
advertising expense is the largest component of our sales and marketing expenses and is primarily attributable to expenditures related to online marketing activities and our offline national radio and television advertising 
for the years ended december   and  our advertising expenses totaled approximately million  million and million  which represents  and  respectively  of our sales and marketing expenses 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in future periods on an absolute dollar basis as we expect to continue to increase our advertising in our efforts to continue to grow the business 
general and administrative expenses consist of wages and benefits for executive  accounting  technology  merchandising and administrative personnel  rents and utilities  legal and accounting fees  travel and entertainment  depreciation and amortization and other general corporate expenses 
we adopted sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning january  under this pronouncement  any remaining goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated at least annually for impairment 
there were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended december   and we have recorded no provision or benefit for federal and state income taxes as we have incurred net operating losses since inception 
as of december  and  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be used to offset future taxable income 
an additional million of net operating losses are limited under internal revenue code section to  a year 
these carryforwards begin to expire in we have provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  because of uncertainty regarding its realizability 
both direct and fulfillment partner revenue are seasonal  with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter  reflecting higher consumer holiday spending 
we anticipate this will continue in the foreseeable future 
with the exception of our acquisition of gear 
com  we have achieved our historical growth from internal operations

this executive commentary includes forward looking statements  and investors are cautioned to read the special note regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this report 
commentary increases in gross bookings 
management believes that to understand our business and our financial statements  investors should understand the difference between total revenue and gross bookings 
gross bookings represents the gross selling price of all transactions  including those for which we only record a commission  before returns  sales discounts  and before payments to fulfillment partners prior to july   and therefore differs from total revenue 
we sustained year over year growth in gross bookings for s four quarters of    and  respectively  compared to s respective quarters 
for the year  gross bookings grew from million to million in our bc business  which excludes safeway and our bb business  grew in this growth was due to the continued expansion of our customer base of our million customers were added during from our online and offline marketing efforts 
we consider the growth in gross bookings especially noteworthy  because we ended our arrangement with safeway in february the safeway program had represented of gross bookings during  and less than of gross bookings in commentary improved gross margins 
quarterly gross margins during the periods q through q were    and  respectively 
in comparing and  revenue increased from million to million while gross profit dollars increased from million to million 
management considers improvements in gross margins and the resulting increase in gross profit dollars to be an important aspect of our financial results 
the improvements in gross margins are a result of improvements made or efficiencies gained in several areas 
in particular  we believe that our buying has become more effective as we continue to grow  allowing us to make larger inventory purchases and obtain more favorable pricing 
our handling cost per package has decreased during the year due to better process management and lower packaging costs from increased sales volumes 
as a result of increased volumes and improved vendor relationships  we have obtained decreases in both inbound and outbound shipping costs 
we have also made improvements to the cost of processing returns  customer service costs and credit card fees 
commentary marketing efforts 
for  our sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in our average customer acquisition cost cpa for increased to  an increase of over the we achieved in this increase in cpa is partially a result of increased pricing of on line marketing in general  as well an increase in overall marketing expenditures in an effort to strengthen our brand 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we spent approximately million marketing our new auctions business  which increased our overall marketing expenditures and reduced our return on our marketing investment 
commentary expense control 
g a increased in absolute dollars  from million in to million in  but as a percentage of gross bookings  g a remained constant at 
increases to g a are a result of higher payroll costs from additional corporate staffing  as well as increased technology  legal  accounting and other corporate costs 
commentary inventory 
during the third and fourth quarters we increased our inventory in preparation for the holiday season 
we believe that we ended with appropriate inventory levels for the first quarter of commentary strategic projects 
following is a brief update on some of our recent strategic projects and initiatives auctions we launched our auctions business in september travel in january we added cruise offerings to our website 
we intend to add additional travel services in the future 
design your own jewelry in january  we launched a new category within our jewelry store design your own jewelry 
this category allows customers purchasing diamond rings to select both a specific diamond and ring setting 
in august  we entered into an agreement with an entity which allows us to lend up to million to the entity for the purpose of buying inventory  primarily to supply this new category 
in november  we loaned the entity million for this purpose see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction 
the balance of our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation provides further information about the matters discussed above and other important matters affecting our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically  the reserve for returns  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the allowance for obsolete and damaged inventory  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from three sources i direct revenue  which consists of merchandise sales made to consumers and businesses that are fulfilled from our warehouse  ii fulfillment partner revenue  which consists of revenue from the sale of merchandise shipped by fulfillment partners directly to consumers and other businesses  as well as fee revenue collected from the products listed and sold through the auction tab of our website  and iii commission revenue from our auctions and travel operations 
all sources of revenue are recorded net of returns  coupons redeemed by customers  and other discounts 
revenue from our auction and travel services were not material in and therefore are included in fulfillment partner revenue 
prior to july   we did not own or physically handle the merchandise sold in fulfillment partner transactions  as the merchandise was shipped directly by a third party vendor  who also handled all customer returns related to those sales 
however  beginning july   we took responsibility for returned items relating to these sales  and we now handle the resale of returned items 
as a result  beginning july   we are considered to be the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions  and we assume the risk of loss on returned items 
as a consequence  we now record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions involving our fulfillment partners excluding auction and travel products on a gross basis  rather than recording them on a net basis as we did prior to july  similar to our direct revenue segment  fulfillment partner products are available to both consumers and businesses through our club o frequent buyers club and our club o gold bulk purchase program 
for sales transactions  we comply with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped or the service provided and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally require payment by credit card at the point of sale 
amounts received prior to when we ship the goods or provide the services to customers are recorded as deferred revenue 
in addition  amounts received in advance for club o and club o gold membership fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the membership period 
reserve for returns  allowance for doubtful accounts and the allowance for obsolete and damaged inventory 
our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns reserve and other allowances in any accounting period 
the reserve for returns was million as of december  and million as of december  from time to time  we may grant credit to certain of our business customers on normal credit terms 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of all accounts receivable 
we maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of  as of december  and  as of december  we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or damage equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory balance was million  net of reserve for obsolescence or damaged inventory of million as of december  at december   our inventory balance was million  net of reserve for obsolescence or damaged inventory of million 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december  and  we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  against our net deferred tax asset balance due to uncertainties related to our deferred tax assets as a result of our history of operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized  but must be tested for impairment at least annually 
other long lived assets must also be evaluated for impairment when management believes that an asset has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in an asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
there were no impairments of goodwill or long lived assets during or goodwill amounted to million as of december  and results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue for  and year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue revenue direct revenue fulfillment partner revenue total revenue cost of goods sold direct fulfillment partner total cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses operating loss interest income interest expense other income expense  net net loss comparison of years ended december  and revenue beginning july   customer returns from sales shipped by our fulfillment partners are returned directly to us and processed through our salt lake city warehouse  rather than returned to our fulfillment partners  as they previously were 
we made the decision to change this policy to have more control over the overstock customer shopping experience  as we believe that a seamless customer experience is key to creating loyal  long term customers 
by accepting returns at our warehouse  we can verify that fulfillment partner products are being packaged and shipped to our standards 
additionally  as customer returns are now all shipped to one location  the process is simpler and more convenient for our customers 
as a result of this change in business practices  we now record the majority of these sales transactions shipped by our fulfillment partners on a gross basis instead of a net basis as we have historically done 
therefore  from the third quarter forward  revenue recorded in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap will increase significantly from our results as reported in sec filings prior to the third quarter of additionally  direct revenue  as a percentage of total revenue will decrease significantly while fulfillment partner revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  will increase significantly 
as a result  for each of the years presented  we believe that for year over year comparison purposes  gross bookings comparisons may be more informative than revenue comparisons  as the gross bookings were not affected by the change in business practices 
gross bookings represents the gross selling price of all transactions before returns  sales discounts  and before payments to fulfillment partners prior to july  since it has been over months since we implemented the change described above  year over year revenue  in addition to gross bookings  will again be comparable in total revenue grew from million in  to million in  representing growth of 
during this same period  direct revenue increased from million to million growth and fulfillment partner revenue grew from million to million growth 
the significant increase in total revenue was due primarily to the change in our business practices described above  coupled with an increase in the number of orders including both direct and fulfillment partner orders  which grew from million in to million in our total revenue continues to expand from increased marketing efforts  including new nationwide television commercials and radio advertising campaigns 
the increase in total revenue is a reflection of our ability to acquire new customers  as evidenced by our addition of million new customers in gross bookings totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of 
gross bookings differ from gaap revenue in that gross bookings represent the gross sales price of goods sold by the company before returns  sales discounts and before payments to fulfillment partners prior to july  cost of goods sold and gross margins as a result of the fulfillment partner returns policy change that occurred beginning the third quarter of  we now record sales transactions shipped by our fulfillment partners on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have historically done 
therefore  cost of goods sold increased significantly beginning in the third quarter of  which resulted in a decrease in gross margins from previous quarters 
these margins will now more closely resemble margins we receive from our direct revenue 
as a result  we believe that for year over year comparison purposes  gross profit dollar comparisons may be more informative than gross margin percentage comparisons 
since it has been over months since we implemented the change described above  year over year results will again be comparable in cost of goods sold increased in absolute dollars  from million in to million in in comparing and  total revenue increased from million to million while gross profit dollars increased from million to million 
however  as a percent of total revenue  cost of goods sold decreased from to for those respective periods resulting in gross margins of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
quarterly gross margins during the periods from the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of were    and  respectively 
the improvements in gross margins are a result of the progress we achieved and efficiencies gained in several areas 
in particular  we believe our buying has become more effective as we continue to grow  allowing us to make larger inventory purchases and obtain more favorable pricing 
our handling cost package has decreased during the year due to better process management and lower packaging costs from increased sales volumes 
fulfillment costs in and were million and million  respectively  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
as a result of increased volumes and improved vendor relationships  we have obtained decreases in both inbound and outbound shipping costs 
additionally  we have also made improvements to the cost of processing returns  customer service costs and credit card fees 
gross profits for our direct operations increased from million for the year ended december  to million recorded during the same period in for our direct operations  gross profit dollars increased on a year over year basis while sales increased 
gross profits for our direct operations  as a percentage of direct revenue increased from in to in this was primarily due to the efficiencies received including more favorable pricing and effective buying as well as decreases in outbound and inbound shipping costs 
cost of goods sold on sales transactions from our fulfillment partners now includes the cost of the product  warehousing and fulfillment costs  including credit card fees and customer service costs 
therefore  beginning in the third quarter of  overall blended gross margins are significantly lower than they had historically been 
our fulfillment partner operations generated gross profits of million margins and million margins for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the gross profit dollars for our fulfillment partner operations was due to the general growth of the consumer business during the year  and an increase in the number of fulfillment partner products offered on our websites 
the increase in gross margins for our fulfillment partner operations is largely due to improvements in buying  customer service costs and credit card fees  as well as a decrease in bmv sales from of fulfillment partner revenue in to in gross margins for bmv products have historically been much lower than those of other product categories 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing of total revenue for each year 
during  online marketing rates generally increased 
this increase coupled with our decision to increase our ongoing online marketing efforts  particularly with the large portals msn  yahoo aol  and keyword search google resulted in the increase in our sales and marketing expenses 
in addition  we continued our television and radio campaigns throughout general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
as a percentage of gross bookings  general and administrative expenses were for each of those respective years 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to costs associated with building infrastructure  including expansion of corporate systems and additional personnel costs from increased corporate headcount 
the increase in general and administrative expenses also included the costs associated with the strategic projects of  namely  completion our auctions tab  reconstruction of our travel department and the development of our search engine 
the increase also reflects significant increases in technology  legal and accounting costs over amortization of stock based compensation 
prior to the company s initial public offering in may  the company recorded unearned stock based compensation related to stock options granted below the fair market value of the underlying stock 
since the initial public offering  the company has not granted any additional stock options below fair market value 
amortization of stock based compensation was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense 
the increase in interest income from  in to million in is due to the increase in our cash and marketable securities from our equity and debt offerings during interest expense increased from  in to  in  primarily as a result of the interest expense from our convertible senior notes issued in november other income expense was relatively consistent  changing from income of  in to expense of  in income taxes 
at december  and  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be used to offset future taxable income 
an additional million of net operating losses are limited under internal revenue code section to  a year 
these carryforwards begin to expire in comparison of years ended december  and revenue as previously described  beginning july   customer returns from sales shipped by our fulfillment partners are returned directly to us and processed through our salt lake city warehouse  rather than returned to our fulfillment partners 
as a result of this change in business practices  we now record sales transactions shipped by our fulfillment partners on a gross basis instead of on a net basis 
therefore  from the third quarter forward  revenue recorded in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap will increase significantly from our results as reported in previous sec filings 
additionally  as illustrated in the table above that sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue  direct revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased significantly while fulfillment partner revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased 
as a result  we believe that for year over year comparison purposes  gross bookings non gaap comparisons may be more informative than gaap revenue comparisons  as gross bookings were not affected by the change in business practices 
total revenue grew from million in  to million in  representing growth of 
during this same period  direct revenue increased from million to million  or growth  and fulfillment partner revenue grew from million to million  representing growth of 
the significant increase in total revenue was due primarily to the change in our business practices described above  coupled with an increase in the number of both direct and fulfillment partner orders and sales to other businesses 
this increase was also a result of the growth of our bc business due to increased marketing efforts  including the initiation of a nationwide television and radio advertising campaign that began in the third quarter of and continued through the fourth quarter 
gross bookings totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of 
gross bookings differ from gaap revenue in that gross bookings represent the gross sales price of goods sold by the company before returns  sales discounts and before payments to fulfillment partners prior to july  cost of goods sold and gross margins as a result of the fulfillment partner returns policy change that occurred beginning the third quarter of  we now record sales transactions shipped by our fulfillment partners on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have historically done 
therefore  gaap revenue increased significantly beginning in the third quarter of  which resulted in a significant increase in cost of goods sold and hence  a decrease in gross margins from previous quarters 
these margins will now more closely resemble margins we receive from our direct revenue 
as a result  we believe that for year over year comparison purposes  gross profit dollar comparisons may be more informative than gross margin percentage comparisons 
cost of goods sold increased in absolute dollars  from million in to million in  and as a percent of total revenue  from to  respectively 
this increase in cost of goods sold  as a percent of total revenue  was primarily a result of the change in our business practices described above 
in addition  cost of goods sold increased as a percentage of total revenue due to the growth in sales of bmv products  which account for approximately of total revenue in  compared to less than in these combined changes correlate to gross margins of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of goods sold also includes stock based compensation of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profits for our direct operations increased to million for the year ended december   from million recorded during the same period in for our direct operations  gross profit dollars increased on a year over year basis while sales increased 
gross profits for our direct operations  as a percentage of direct revenue decreased from in to in this was primarily due to increased costs related to capacity expansion at the warehouse  as well as an increase in warehouse handling expense as we ramped up staffing and packaging in anticipation of sales increases 
additionally  overall returns costs increased significantly as we increased capacity and staffing for increased returns volumes due to the returns policy change  and due to process inefficiencies that were identified and fixed during the third and fourth quarters 
cost of goods sold on sales transactions from our fulfillment partners now includes the cost of the product  warehousing and fulfillment costs  credit card fees and customer service costs 
therefore  beginning in the third quarter of  overall blended gross margins will be significantly lower than they have historically been 
now that the costs related to the initial implementation and process refinement of the fulfillment partner returns process have been absorbed in the third quarter  future gross profit dollars generated from these sales should not be significantly affected by this change 
our fulfillment partner operations generated gross profits of million margins and million margins for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the gross profit dollars for our fulfillment partner operations was due to the general growth of the consumer business during the year  and an increase in the number of fulfillment partner products offered on our websites 
the decrease in gross margins for our fulfillment partner operations is largely due to the change in our business operations described above as well as an increase in bmv sales from of fulfillment partner revenue in to in margins for bmv products have historically been much lower than those of other product categories 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increased marketing expense reflects increased online marketing efforts  particularly with the large portals msn  yahoo aol  and with our affiliate marketing program 
in addition  during we initiated our first national radio and television campaign  which added approximately million to the marketing expense in the current year over the previous year 
we expect total marketing expenses to continue to increase in the future as a result of the expenses related to online marketing agreements that we have recently entered into and similar online or offline radio  television  or other similar agreements that we may enter into in the future 
the decrease in sales and marketing as a percentage of total revenue was due to the increase in total revenue in which was a result of the fulfillment partner returns policy change that occurred beginning the third quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to costs associated with building infrastructure  including expansion of corporate systems and additional personnel costs from increased corporate headcount 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was due to the increase in total revenue in which was a result of the fulfillment partner returns policy change that occurred beginning the third quarter of amortization of stock based compensation 
prior to the company s initial public offering in may  the company recorded unearned stock based compensation related to stock options granted below the fair market value of the underlying stock 
since the initial public offering  the company has not granted any additional stock options below fair market value 
amortization of stock based compensation was approximately million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense 
the increase in interest income from  in to  in is due to the increase in our cash and marketable securities from our follow on offering in the first quarter of interest expense decreased from  in to  in  primarily as a result of our termination of our inventory lines of credit in june and the reduction in our capital leases 
other income expense changed from expense of  in to income of  in primarily because the company paid  of selling costs on behalf of a selling shareholder as part of the initial public offering in income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses in and  and consequently paid insignificant amounts of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
as of december   we had million of net operating loss carryforwards  of which million is subject to limitation 
these net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for the eight most recent quarters for the period ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods presented 
the information in the table below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k

 additional operating data gross bookings in thousands    number of orders     number of new bc customers    average customer acquisition cost the additional operating data sets forth certain operating data relating to our business for the eight most recent quarters for the period ended december  while we believe that the information in the table above facilitates an understanding of our business and results of operations for the periods presented  such information is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should be read in conjunction with the quarterly results of operations data set forth above 
we believe that gross bookings is a metric widely used in our industry and by making this metric available to investors  we believe investors are able to compare our performance against others in our industry 
we believe that investors may use the average customer acquisition cost metric to determine how efficiently we are able to achieve growth  if any 
again  we believe this metric is widely used in our industry  and providing these values to investors enables them to make more meaningful comparisons 
gross bookings represents the gross sales price of all sales transactions  including those for which we only record a commission under generally accepted accounting principles  and therefore differs from gaap revenue 
beginning july  we changed our business practices regarding returns  which affected our fulfillment partner revenue 
as a result  we believe that for year over year comparison purposes  gross bookings non gaap comparisons may be more informative than gaap revenue comparisons  as the gross bookings were not affected by the change in business practices 
number of orders represents the number of individual orders for merchandise through our websites excluding bb orders 
number of new bc customers represents the number of valid new customer accounts 
to establish a valid customer account  a person must provide us with the following information and purchase merchandise on our bc website a unique e mail address  a unique password  and a verified credit card account number 
average customer acquisition cost represents total sales and marketing expense divided by the number of new customers for the period presented

 as a percentage of total revenue revenue direct revenue fulfillment partner revenue total revenue cost of goods sold direct fulfillment partner total cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other income expense  net net income loss our direct revenue and fulfillment partner revenue have increased in every quarter on a year over year basis 
the general increase in total revenue is due to the expansion of our customer base as we attracted more visitors to our websites  as well as repeat purchases from these customers 
we have experienced significant seasonality in our business  reflecting a combination of seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality patterns 
internet usage and the rate of internet growth may be expected to decline during the summer 
further  sales in the traditional retail industry are significantly higher in the fourth calendar quarter of each year than in the preceding three quarters 
fulfillment partner revenue increased significantly beginning in the third quarter of due to the change in our business practices 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue has fluctuated in the quarterly periods reflected above ranging from to 
the significant increases during the rd and th quarters of relate specifically to the change in business practices in our fulfillment partner operations and the resulting shift from recognizing revenue on a commission basis to a gross basis 
gross margins during the periods q through q were    and  respectively 
in comparing the fourth quarters of and  revenue increased from million to million while gross profit dollars increased from million to million 
our margins improvement stems from our efforts in tightening our logistics costs and achieving better pricing on merchandise purchased to sell on our websites 
total operating expenses as a percentage of gross bookings have generally decreased on a year over year basis each quarter during as compared to as a result of economies of scale achieved through increased sales volume 
in the near future  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts  and expect that total operating expenses may increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
these expenses as a percentage of total revenue will vary depending on the level of revenue obtained 
due to the foregoing factors  in one or more future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such an event  the trading price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the second quarter of  we financed our activities primarily through a series of private sales of equity securities  warrants to purchase our common stock and promissory notes 
during the second quarter of  we completed our initial public offering pursuant to which we received approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions  and other related expenses 
additionally  we completed follow on offerings in february  may and november  pursuant to which we received approximately million  million and million  respectively  in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions  and other related expenses 
in november  we also received million in proceeds from the issuance of our convertible senior notes in a transaction event exempt from registration under the securities act 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million and our marketable securities totaled million 
our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million for the year ended december  and net cash inflows of million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash and cash equivalents during was to fund our operations  including net losses of million  and changes in inventories million  prepaid expenses and other assets million  and other long term assets 
this was offset by the change in accounts receivable million  accounts payable million and accrued liabilities million 
cash used in investing activities included million in capital expenditures for property and equipment and a net decrease of million from the purchase and sales of marketable securities 
for the years ended december  and  net cash provided by used in investing activities amounted to million and million  respectively

cash flows from financing activities included  for payments on capital leases 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  consisting primarily of net proceeds of million received from the follow on public offering which occurred in february and approximately million received from the exercise of stock options and warrants  offset by  of payments on capital leases 
contractual obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt arrangements   interest on convertible senior notes    capital lease obligations  operating leases      purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations    amounts of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years letters of credit   redeemable common stock   total commercial commitments    in november  we completed an offering of million of convertible senior notes the senior notes 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on june and december of each year  beginning june  the senior notes mature on december  and are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured  unsubordinated debt and senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness 
the senior notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity into our common stock at the option of the note holders at a conversion price of per share or approximately  shares subject to adjustment in certain events  including stock splits  dividends and other distributions and certain repurchases of our stock  as well as certain fundamental changes in the ownership of the company 
beginning december   we have the right to redeem the senior notes  in whole or in part  for cash at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change including the acquisition of a majority interest in the company  certain changes in the company s board of directors or the termination of trading of our stock meeting certain conditions  holders of the senior notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their notes at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the lease obligations include our obligations under a ten year lease agreement we entered in december for approximately  square feet of office space in salt lake city 
we expect to take possession of the new office space in the summer of  and to terminate our lease obligations under our current office lease agreements at the same time 
the total lease obligation over the ten year term of the new lease is million  of which approximately million will be payable in in connection with the preparation of the new office space  we have agreed to provide a letter of credit for  to provide funds to discharge our obligations upon termination of the new sublease and have also agreed to pay approximately million for leasehold improvements 
we expect to pay this entire amount for leasehold improvements during the amount of purchase obligations shown is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of purchase orders we had outstanding at december  under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable law  the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table above would be less 
in may  we entered into a senior secured credit facility for a revolving line of credit of up to million 
the facility was collateralized by all of our assets 
however  we terminated the facility in december in december  we replaced the senior secured credit facility described above with an amendment to a credit agreement amended credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association 
the existing credit agreement originally executed in february provided the company with a revolving line of credit for the purpose of issuing up to million of letters of credit for the purchase of inventory 
the amended credit agreement provides us a revolving line of credit of up to million and expires december  we have an option to renew the amended credit agreement annually 
included in the million amended credit agreement is a million sub limit for a revolving line of credit which we use to obtain letters of credit to support inventory purchases 
at december  the issuing bank or an affiliate of the bank had letters of credit totaling million issued on our behalf under this facility 
however  we have no liability for this amount except to the extent  if any  that a beneficiary of any of the outstanding letters of credit draws upon a letter of credit 
interest on the facility is payable monthly and accrues at either i one half of one percentage point above libor in effect on the first day of an applicable fixed rate term  or ii at a fluctuating rate per annum determined by the bank to be one half a percent above daily libor in effect on each business day a change in daily libor is announced by the bank 
unpaid principal  together with accrued and unpaid interest is due on december  borrowings under the facility are collateralized by our cash and marketable securities deposited at wells fargo or its affiliates  and we are required to maintain balances with wells fargo or its affiliates of up to million in order to have the full amount of the credit facility available to us 
consequently  although the facility provides us with some flexibility  it does not increase our liquidity 
the amended credit agreement requires us to comply with certain covenants  including restrictions on mergers  business combinations or transfers of assets 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  at december   there was no outstanding balance under the facility except for the outstanding letters of credit 
the estimated amount of redeemable common stock is based solely on the statutes of limitations of the various states in which stockholders may have rescission rights and may not reflect the actual results 
the stock is not redeemable by its terms 
we do not have any unconditional purchase obligations  other long term obligations  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments 
in january  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock through december  under the program  shares may be purchased as determined by management  from time to time and within certain guidelines  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  including privately negotiated structured stock repurchase transactions and through transactions in the options markets 
depending on market conditions and other factors  these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
in february and march  in connection with the buyback program  we entered into several purchased call options  pursuant to which we may purchase up to  shares of our common stock at certain settlement dates 
in connection with these repurchase transactions  we have paid approximately million 
upon settlement  we  at our option  may elect to settle the contracts by physical settlement  net share settlement or net cash settlement 
accordingly  we expect to receive either our capital investment returned with a premium or shares of our common stock  depending on whether the market price of our common stock is above or below pre determined prices agreed in connection with each such transaction 
to the extent that shares of common stock are delivered to us as a result of the transactions described above  the aggregate amount the company pays or paid for the repurchase of the shares as a result of these transactions will reduce the amount we might otherwise have spent to directly repurchase shares from time to time under the stock repurchase program 
we believe that the cash and marketable securities currently on hand  amounts available under our credit facility and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months 
while we anticipate that  beyond the next twelve months  our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operational requirements  we may require additional financing 
however  there can be no assurance that if additional financing is necessary it will be available  or  if available  that such financing can be obtained on satisfactory terms 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  generate profitability or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern and to achieve our intended business objectives 
any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
see risk factors 
seasonality financial results for internet retailers are generally seasonal 
based upon the company s historical experience  increased revenues typically occur during the fourth quarter because of the christmas retail season 
the actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences  availability of product and competition  among other risks and uncertainties 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect the company s results of operations in the future 
the following table reflects the company s revenues for each of the quarters available since in thousands first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter note that total revenue since the third quarter of reflects the change in our policy in which sales by fulfillment partners are recorded gross instead of net as in prior quarters 
factors that may affect future results any investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  trade accounts and contracts receivable  accounts payable and long term obligations 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments and short term obligations  thus  fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates of one hundred basis points would have an estimated impact of approximately million on our earnings or loss  or the fair market value or cash flows of these instruments 
at december   we had approximately million of convertible senior notes outstanding which bear interest at a fixed rate of 
in addition  at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under our line of credit and letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under our credit facility 
the fair value of the convertible senior notes is sensitive to interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of the convertible senior notes  due to differences between market interest rates and rates in effect at the inception of the obligation 
unless we elect to repurchase our convertible senior notes in the open market  changes in the fair value of convertible senior notes have no impact on our cash flows or consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of the convertible senior notes was million at december  in january  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we can repurchase up to million of our common stock through december  under the program  shares may be purchased as determined by management  from time to time and within certain guidelines  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  including privately negotiated structured stock repurchase transactions and through transactions in the options markets 
depending on market conditions and other factors  these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
in february and march  we entered into several purchased call options  pursuant to which we may purchase up to  shares of our common stock at certain settlement dates 
in connection with these repurchase transactions  we have paid approximately million 
upon settlement  we  at our option  may elect to settle the contracts by physical settlement  net share settlement or net cash settlement 
accordingly  we expect to receive  either our capital investment returned with a premium or shares of our common stock  depending on whether the market price of our common stock is above or below pre determined prices agreed in connection with each such transaction 
as a result of these structured stock repurchase transactions  we have market risk exposure to the trading price of our common stock 
the objective and general strategy of the transactions is to implement a portion of the stock repurchases authorized by our board of directors 
the instruments used to manage our exposure are call spreads which have the economic effect described in the preceding paragraph 
we have had no such arrangements prior to february we may enter into similar transactions in the future 
at december   we had not entered into any of the structured stock repurchase transactions described herein
