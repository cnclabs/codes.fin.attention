item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is one of the leading education finance companies in the united states and is focused on providing quality student loan products and services to students and schools nationwide 
the company ranks among the nation s leaders in terms of total net student loan assets with billion as of december  the company s business is comprised of three primary product and service offerings o asset management  including student loan originations and acquisitions 
the company provides student loan marketing  originations  acquisition  and portfolio management 
the company owns a large portfolio of student loan assets through a series of education lending subsidiaries 
the company obtains loans through direct origination or through acquisition of loans 
the company also provides marketing  sales  managerial  and administrative support related to its asset generation activities 
o student loan and guarantee servicing 
the company services its student loan portfolio and the portfolios of third parties 
servicing activities include loan origination activities  application processing  borrower updates  payment processing  due diligence procedures  and claim processing 
the company also provides servicing support to guaranty agencies  which includes system software  hardware and telecommunication support  borrower and loan updates  default aversion tracking services  claim processing services  and post default collection services 
o servicing software 
the company uses internally developed student loan servicing software and also provides this software to third party student loan holders and servicers 
the company s education lending subsidiaries under the asset management service offering are engaged in the securitization of education finance assets 
these education lending subsidiaries hold beneficial interests in eligible loans  subject to creditors with specific interests 
the liabilities of the company s education lending subsidiaries are not the obligations of the company or any of its other subsidiaries and cannot be consolidated in the event of bankruptcy 
the transfers of student loans to the eligible lender trusts do not qualify for sales under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  as the trusts continue to be under the effective control of the company 
accordingly  all the financial activities and related assets and liabilities  including debt  of the securitizations are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s primary product and service offerings constitute reportable segments per the provisions of sfas no 
the following table shows the percent of total segment revenue excluding intersegment revenue and net income loss before taxes for each of the company s segments years ended december  student student loan and loan and asset guarantee servicing asset guarantee servicing management servicing software management servicing software segment revenue segment net income loss before taxes the company s derivative market value adjustment and net settlements are included in the asset management segment 
because the majority of the company s derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 the derivative market value adjustment can cause the percent of revenue and net income loss before taxes to fluctuate from period to period between segments 
the company s student loan portfolio has grown significantly through originations and acquisitions 
the company originated or acquired billion of student loans in through student loan channel acquisitions  including o the direct channel  in which the company originates student loans in one of its brand names directly to student and parent borrowers  which accounted for of the student loans added to the company s loan portfolio through a student loan channel in  o the branding partner channel  in which the company acquires student loans from lenders to whom it provides marketing and origination services  which accounted for of the student loans added to the company s loan portfolio through a student loan channel in  and o the forward flow channel  in which the company acquires student loans from lenders to whom it provides origination services  but provides no marketing services  or who have agreed to sell loans to the company under forward sale commitments  which accounted for of the student loans added to the company s loan portfolio through a student loan channel in in addition  the company also acquires student loans through spot purchases  which accounted for of student loans added to the company s loan portfolio through a student loan channel in not included in the previous student loan channel acquisition data is the addition of million of student loans acquired through a business combination in april significant drivers and trends the company s earnings and earnings growth are directly affected by the size of its portfolio of student loans  the interest rate characteristics of its portfolio  the costs associated with financing and managing its portfolio  and the costs associated with the origination and acquisition of the student loans in the portfolio 
see student loan portfolio 
in addition to the impact of growth of the company s student loan portfolio  the company s results of operations and financial condition may be materially affected by  among other things  changes in o applicable laws and regulations that may affect the volume  terms  effective yields  or refinancing options of education loans  o demand for education financing and competition within the student loan industry  o the interest rate environment  funding spreads on the company s financing programs  and access to capital markets  and o prepayment rates on student loans  including prepayments relating to loan consolidations 
the company s net interest income  or net interest earned on its student loan portfolio  is the primary source of income and is primarily impacted by the size of the portfolio and the net yield of the assets in the portfolio 
if the company s student loan portfolio continues to grow and its net interest margin remains relatively stable  the company expects its net interest income to increase 
the company s portfolio of ffelp loans generally earns interest at the higher of a variable rate based on the special allowance payment  or sap  formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
based upon provisions of the higher education act and related interpretations by the department  loans financed prior to september  with tax exempt obligations issued prior to october  are entitled to receive special allowance payments equal to a minimum rate of return 
in may  the company sought confirmation from the department regarding the treatment and recognition of special allowance payments on a portion of its portfolio that had been previously financed with tax exempt obligations 
while pending satisfactory resolution of this issue with the department  the company deferred recognition of the interest income that was generated by these loans in excess of income based upon the standard special allowance rate 
in june  after consideration of certain clarifying information received in connection with the guidance it had sought  including written and verbal communications with the department  the company concluded that the earnings process had been completed related to the special allowance payments on these loans and recognized million of interest income 
as of december   the amount of deferred excess interest income on these loans was million 
the company currently recognizes the income from the special allowance payments  referred to as the special allowance yield adjustment  on these loans as it is earned and would expect its net interest income to increase over historical periods accordingly  however  since the portfolio subject to the floor is not expected to increase  amounts recognized will decrease as compared to the current period 
in addition  if interest rates rise  the normal yield on the portfolio of loans earning this special allowance will increase  thereby reducing the special allowance yield adjustment 
the company entered into billion in notional amount of interest rate swaps in july to reduce the risk of rising interest rates on this portfolio 
net interest income increased by million  or  in as compared to net interest income  excluding the effects of variable rate floor income and the special allowance yield adjustment  increased approximately million  or  in as compared to  due primarily to portfolio growth 
net student loans receivable increased by billion  or  to billion as of december  as compared to billion as of december  interest income is also dependent upon the relative level of interest rates 
the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility 
the company s management has structured all of its derivative instruments with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  most of the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and thus may adversely impact earnings 
in addition  the mark to market adjustment recorded through earnings in the company s consolidated statements of income may fluctuate from period to period 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
competition for the supply channel of education financing in the student loan industry has caused the cost of acquisition or premiums related to the company s student loan assets to increase 
in addition  the company has seen significant increases in consolidation loan activity and consolidation loan volume within the industry 
the increase in competition for consolidation loans has caused the company to be aggressive in its measures to protect and secure the company s existing portfolio through consolidation efforts 
the company will amortize its premiums paid from the purchase of student loans over the average useful life of the assets 
when the company s loans are consolidated  the company may accelerate recognition of unamortized premiums if the consolidated loan is considered a new loan 
the increase in premiums paid on student loans due to the increase in entrants and competition within the industry  coupled with the company s asset retention practices through consolidation efforts  have caused the company s yields to be reduced in recent periods due to the amortization of premiums  consolidation rebate fees  and the lower yields on consolidation loans 
if the percent of consolidation loans continues to increase as a percent of the company s overall loan portfolio  the company will continue to experience reduced yields 
if these trends continue  the company could continue to see an increase in consolidation rebate fees and amortization costs and a reduction in yield 
see student loan portfolio student loan spread analysis 
although the company s short term yields may be reduced if this trend continues  the company will have been successful in protecting its assets and stabilizing its balance sheet for long term growth 
conversely  a reduction in consolidation of the company s own loans or the loans of third parties could positively impact the effect of amortization on the company s student loan yield from period to period 
also  as the company s portfolio of consolidation loans grows both in nominal dollars and as a percent of the total portfolio  the impact of premium amortization as a percent of student loan yield should decrease unless the cost of acquisition of consolidation loans or underlying loans increases substantially in the future 
net interest income includes million  or basis points  in yield reduction due to the amortization of premiums and deferred origination costs in as compared to million  or basis points  in the company s unamortized premiums and deferred origination costs  as a percent of student loans  decreased from as of december  to as of december  net interest income also includes million  or basis points  in yield reduction due to consolidation rebate fees in  as compared to million  or basis points  in the increase in the consolidation loan rebate fee  combined with the lower lender yield of the consolidation loans the company is originating  has resulted in student loan interest spread compression  excluding the effects of variable rate floor income and the special allowance yield adjustment  net of settlements on derivatives  from in to in recent developments as previously discussed  based on provisions of the higher education act and related interpretations  education lenders may receive special allowance payments providing the floor on loans currently or financed prior to september  with proceeds of tax exempt obligations issued prior to october  the company holds ffelp loans  which are receiving special allowance payments based upon the floor  and were previously financed prior to september  with proceeds of tax exempt obligations issued prior to october   of approximately billion as of december  the company sought confirmation regarding whether it was allowed to receive the special allowance income based on the floor on such loans following refinancing with proceeds of taxable obligations 
for periods through march   the company had deferred recognition of a portion of the income from the floor which exceeded ordinary special allowance payment rates generated by these loans  pending satisfactory resolution of this issue 
as previously disclosed  after consideration of certain clarifying information received in connection with the guidance it had sought and based on written and verbal communications with the department  the company concluded that the earnings process had been completed and determined to recognize the related income 
following the company s disclosures related to recognition of such income  senator edward m 
kennedy  by letter to the secretary of education dated august   requested information as to whether the department had approved of the company s receipt of the floor income and  if not  why the department had not sought to recover claimed subsidies under the floor 
by letter dated september   the company furnished to the department certain background information concerning the growth of the floor loans in its portfolio  which information had been requested by the department 
senator kennedy  in a second letter to the sec dated september   requested that the sec investigate the company s activities related to the floor 
more specifically  senator kennedy raised concerns about the company s disclosures in connection with its decision to recognize the previously deferred income  and trading of company securities by company executives following such disclosures 
on september   the company voluntarily contacted the sec to request a meeting with the sec staff 
the company s request was granted  and representatives of the company met with representatives of the sec staff on october  company representatives offered to provide to the sec information that the sec staff wished to have relating to the issues raised in senator kennedy s letter 
by letter dated october   the sec staff requested that  in connection with an informal investigation  the company provide certain identified information 
the company has furnished to the sec staff the information it has requested and is fully cooperating with the sec staff in its informal investigation 
the company continues to believe that the concerns expressed to the sec by senator kennedy are entirely unfounded  but it is not appropriate or feasible to determine or predict the ultimate outcome of the sec s informal investigation 
the company s costs related to the sec s informal investigation are being expensed as incurred 
additional costs  if any  associated with an adverse outcome or resolution of that matter  in a manner that is currently indeterminate and inherently unpredictable  could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
although it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain circumstances could have a material adverse effect  based on information currently known by the company s management  in its opinion  the outcome of such pending informal investigation is not likely to have such an effect 
in october  congress passed and president bush signed into law the taxpayer teacher protection act of the october act  which prospectively suspended eligibility for the floor on any loans refinanced with proceeds of taxable obligations between september  and january  the company s ffelp loans  which have been refinanced with proceeds of taxable obligations and are receiving special allowance payments under the floor  were all refinanced with proceeds of taxable obligations well before september  the company had ceased adding to its portfolio of loans receiving special allowance payments subject to the floor in may  and thus the language in the october act is not expected to have an effect upon the eligibility of such loans for the floor  nor is it expected to have a material effect upon the company s financial condition or results of operation 
president bush has made several proposals in connection with the ffel program in his fiscal year budget as proposed to congress 
some of the highlights of the president s budget proposals  in no particular order  include o prospectively ending eligibility for the floor making the provision of the october act permanent  o reducing the federal guarantee on ffel program loans from to  o reducing the guarantee for loans serviced by servicers designated as exceptional performers from to  o providing for variable interest rates on consolidation loans  and maintaining variable interest rates on all other loan types  effectively repealing the planned change to fixed interest rates that was to occur on july   o granting extended repayment terms and increasing the limits on the amount that borrowers may borrow for ffelp loans  o increasing the origination fee charged to lenders from basis points to basis points  o imposing a new annual basis point origination fee on consolidation loans  and o permitting the reconsolidation or refinancing of existing consolidation loans on multiple occasions and require borrowers to pay a basis point origination fee for each such refinancing 
the company cannot predict whether the president s budget proposals will be enacted into law  but they may form some of the framework for the congress as it negotiates the fiscal year budget resolution 
acquisitions the company has positioned itself for growth by building a strong foundation through acquisitions 
although the company s assets  loan portfolios  and fee based revenues increase through such transactions  a key aspect of each transaction is its impact on the company s prospective organic growth and the development of its integrated platform of services 
as a result of these acquisitions and the company s rapid organic growth  the period to period comparability of the company s results of operations may be difficult 
a summary of the company s acquisitions follows in january  the company acquired of the membership interests in premiere credit of north america  llc premiere  a collection services company that specializes in collection of educational debt 
this investment is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in march  the company acquired rights  title  and interest in certain assets of the rhode island student loan authority risla  including the right to originate student loans in risla s name without competition from risla for a period of ten years 
the company further agreed to provide administrative services in connection with certain of the indentures governing debt securities of risla for a year period 
in april  the company purchased slaaa acquisition corp 
slaaa  a student loan secondary market 
also in april  the company purchased of the stock of infinet integrated solutions  inc infinet  an ecommerce services provider for colleges  universities  and healthcare organizations 
infinet provides customer focused electronic transactions  information sharing  and account and bill presentment 
this investment is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in december  the company purchased of the stock of edulinx 
edulinx is a canadian corporation that engages in servicing of canadian student loans 
net interest income the company generates the majority of its earnings from its student loan spread 
this spread income is reported on the company s income statement as net interest income 
the amortization and write offs of premiums or discounts  including capitalized costs of origination  the consolidation loan rebate fee  and yield adjustments from borrower benefit programs  are netted against loan interest income on the company s income statement 
the amortization and write offs of debt issuance costs are included in interest expense on the company s income statement 
the company s portfolio of ffelp loans generally earns interest at the higher of a variable rate based on the special allowance payment  or sap  formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
depending on the type of student loan and when the loan was originated  the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to a market rate each july the larger the reduction in rates subsequent to the july annual borrower interest rate reset date  the greater the company s opportunity to earn variable rate floor income 
in declining interest rate environments  the company can earn significant amounts of such income 
conversely  as the decline in rates abates  or in environments where interest rates are rising  the company s opportunity to earn variable rate floor income can be reduced  in some cases substantially 
since the borrower rates are reset annually  the company views earnings on variable rate floor income as temporary and not necessarily sustainable 
the company s ability to earn variable rate floor income in future periods is dependent upon the interest rate environment following the annual reset of borrower rates  and the company cannot assure the nature of such environment in the future 
the company recorded approximately  of variable rate floor income in as compared to approximately million in on those ffelp loans with fixed term borrower rates  primarily consolidation loans  the company earns interest at the greater of the borrower rate or a variable rate based on the sap formula 
since the company finances the majority of its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt  the company may earn excess spread on these loans for an extended period of time 
on most consolidation loans  the company must pay a per year rebate fee to the department 
those consolidation loans that have variable interest rates based on the sap formula earn an annual yield less than that of a stafford loan 
those consolidation loans that have fixed interest rates less than the sum of and the variable rate based on the sap formula also earn an annual yield less than that of a stafford loan 
as a result  as consolidation loans matching these criteria become a larger portion of the company s loan portfolio  there will be a lower yield on the company s loan portfolio in the short term 
however  due to the extended terms of consolidation loans  the company expects to earn the yield on these loans for a longer duration  making them beneficial to the company in the long term 
because the company generates the majority of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s balance sheet is very important to its operations 
the current and future interest rate environment can and will affect the company s interest earnings  net interest income  and net income 
the effects of changing interest rate environments are further outlined in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
investment interest income includes income from unrestricted interest earning deposits and funds in the company s special purpose entities for its asset backed securitizations 
provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is estimated and established through a provision charged to expense 
losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectibility of the loan principal is unlikely 
recovery of amounts previously charged off is credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses associated with its student loan portfolio at a level that is based on the performance characteristics of the underlying loans 
the company analyzes the allowance separately for its federally insured loans and its non federally insured loans 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
the federal government guarantees of principal and interest of federally insured student loans  which limits the company s loss exposure to of the outstanding balance of the company s federally insured portfolio 
effective june   the company was designated as an exceptional performer by the department in recognition of its exceptional level of performance in servicing ffel program loans 
as a result of this designation  the company receives reimbursement on all eligible ffel program default claims submitted for reimbursement during the month period following the effective date of its designation 
the company is not subject to the risk sharing loss for eligible claims submitted during this month period 
only ffel program loans that are serviced by the company  as well as loans owned by the company and serviced by other service providers designated as exceptional performers by the department  are subject to the reimbursement 
in  the company s allowance and the provision for loan losses were each reduced by million to account for the estimated effects of the exceptional performance designations 
as of december   service providers designated as an exceptional performer serviced more than of the company s federally insured loans 
of this  third parties serviced approximately 
the company is entitled to receive this benefit as long as it and or its other service providers continue to meet the required servicing standards published by the department 
compliance with such standards is assessed on a quarterly basis 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  months in repayment  delinquency status  type of program  and trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data 
the company charges off these uninsured loans when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective  as it requires material estimates that may be subject to significant changes 
the provision for loan losses reflects the activity for the applicable period and provides an allowance at a level that management believes is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
other income the company also earns fees and generates income from other sources  including principally loan servicing  guarantee servicing  and licensing fees on its software products 
loan servicing fees are determined according to individual agreements with customers and are calculated based on the dollar value or number of loans serviced for each customer 
guarantee servicing fees are calculated based on the number of loans serviced or amounts collected 
software services income includes software license and maintenance fees associated with student loan software products 
other income also includes the derivative market value adjustment and net settlements as further discussed in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s other income included net settlements incurred on derivatives of million in as compared to million in the company s other income also included mark to market losses on derivative instruments of million in as compared to million in this increase  in addition to the changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the forward yield curve  is the result of the company entering into billion in notional amount of derivatives in july operating expenses operating expenses include costs incurred to manage and administer the company s student loan portfolio and its financing transactions  costs incurred to generate and acquire student loans  and general and administrative expenses

total loan interest  including amortization of loan premiums and deferred origination costs  increased as a result of an increase in the size of the student loan portfolio and the special allowance yield adjustment  offset by changes in the interest rate environment and in the pricing characteristics of the company s student loan assets 
the special allowance yield adjustment of million  offset by lower average interest rates on loans  caused an increase in the student loan net yield on the company s student loan portfolio to from when excluding the special allowance yield adjustment  the student loan yield in was 
variable rate floor income decreased due to the relative change in interest rates during the periods subsequent to the annual borrower interest rate reset date on july of each year 
consequently  the company realized approximately  of variable rate floor income in as compared to million in the weighted average interest rate on the student loan portfolio increased due to the special allowance yield adjustment  offset by lower interest rates on loans  and the increase in the number of lower yielding consolidation loans  resulting in an increase in loan interest income of approximately million 
consolidation loan activity also increased the amortization and write off of premiums and deferred origination costs and increased the amount incurred on consolidation rebate fees  reducing loan interest income approximately million 
the increase in loan interest income was also a result of an increase in the company s portfolio of student loans 
the average student loan portfolio increased billion  or  which increased loan interest income by approximately million 
interest expense on bonds and notes payable increased as average total debt increased approximately billion  or

net interest income  excluding the effects of variable rate floor income and the special allowance yield adjustment  increased approximately million  or  to approximately million from approximately million 
this increase is consistent with the increase in the average student loan portfolio of 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for federally insured student loans decreased approximately million from an expense of million to a recovery of million because of the company and other servicer s exceptional performer designation in the provision for loan losses for non federally insured loans decreased approximately  from million in to million in because of the decrease in the non federally insured loans and expected performance of the non federally insured loan portfolio 
other income 
loan servicing and other fee income decreased due to the reduction in the number and dollar amount of loans serviced for third parties in our us servicing operations from billion as of december  to billion as of december  total average us third party loan servicing volume decreased million  or  which resulted in a decrease in loan servicing income of million 
the decrease in servicing volume is due to loan pay downs being greater than loan additions within the third party customer portfolios 
this decrease was offset by an increase in servicing fees on the canadian servicing operations of million due to the acquisition of edulinx in december the company had no canadian servicing operations in in addition  guarantee servicing income decreased million due to a customer that did not renew its servicing contract in march the software services and other income increased million as the company began providing administrative services to risla in march in addition  other income increased million as a result of the acquisition of nelnet capital in august also  a one time gain of million was recorded on the sale of a fixed asset in the company utilizes derivative instruments to provide economic hedges to protect against the impact of adverse changes in interest rates

the company s incentive and bonus compensation for was approximately of net income before taxes 
the amount incurred by the company in for its bonus and incentive plans was approximately million more than the amount incurred in in addition to a net increase in the bonus and incentive compensation expenses  salaries and benefits increased due to the acquisition of edulinx in december and our increased personnel resulting from our agreement to provide administrative services to risla in march and the continued expansion of our marketing efforts 
this increase was reduced by a non cash stock compensation charge of million recognized in equal to the difference between the product of the estimated initial public offering price and the number of shares issued in march and the total price paid by the employees 
the decrease in the amortization of intangible assets is due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the decrease in trustee and other debt related fees relates to the reduced broker dealer fees from the acquisition of nelnet capital as previously discussed 
advertising and marketing expenses increased due to the expansion of the company s marketing efforts  especially in the consolidations area 
professional services increased due to additional costs related to operations as a public company

in addition  salary expense increased million in associated with the termination of consulting and employment agreements 
the remaining increase of million is due to the increased personnel from the acquisitions previously described and expansion of the company s marketing efforts

the company originated or acquired billion of student loans in  offset by repayments of approximately billion 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments increased primarily because of a million increase in restricted cash due to loan program customers  which reflects timing of disbursements on loans and increased lockbox volume 
total liabilities increased primarily because of an increase in bonds and notes payable  resulting from additional borrowings to fund growth in student loans 
the fair value of derivatives instruments increased due to the larger notional amounts and change in market conditions on the company s derivative instruments 
other liabilities include restricted cash due to loan program customers that increased million as a result of timing of disbursements on loans and increased lockbox volume 
shareholders equity increased primarily as a result of net income of million in liquidity and capital resources the company utilizes operating cash flows  operating lines of credit  and secured financing transactions to fund operations and student loan originations and acquisitions 
in addition  in december  the company consummated an initial public offering of its class a common stock that yielded the company net proceeds of million 
operating activities provided net cash of million in  an increase of million from the net cash provided by operating activities of million in operating cash flows are driven by net income adjusted for various non cash items such as the provision recovery for loan losses  depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  the derivative market value adjustment  non cash compensation expense  income from equity method investments  and the gain on the sale of a fixed asset

the company uses these facilities primarily for general operating purposes and had no borrowings under these facilities as of december  the company believes these facilities  the growth in the cash flow from operating activities  and the initial public stock offering indicate a favorable trend in its available capital resources 
the company s secured financing instruments include commercial paper lines  short term student loan warehouse programs  variable rate tax exempt bonds  fixed rate bonds  fixed rate tax exempt bonds  and various asset backed securities 
of the billion of debt outstanding as of december   billion was issued under securitization transactions 
in  the company completed four asset backed securities transactions totaling billion 
the proceeds from the september asset backed securities issuance of billion were used to redeem billion of outstanding student loan asset backed auction rate notes 
in addition  in february  the company completed a billion asset backed securities transaction 
depending on market conditions  the company anticipates continuing to access the asset backed securities market in and subsequent years 
securities issued in the securitization transactions are generally priced off a spread to libor or set under an auction procedure 
the student loans financed are generally priced on a spread to commercial paper or us treasury bills 
the company s warehouse facilities allow for expansion of liquidity and capacity for student loan growth and should provide adequate liquidity to fund the company s student loan operations for the foreseeable future 
as of december   the company had a student loan warehousing capacity of billion  of which billion was outstanding  through day commercial paper conduit programs 
these conduit programs mature in through  however  they must be renewed annually by underlying liquidity providers 
historically  the company has been able to renew its commercial paper conduit programs  including the underlying liquidity agreements  and therefore does not believe the renewal of these contracts present a significant risk to its liquidity 
because the company continues to grow its student loan portfolio  the company increased its student loan warehousing capacity to billion in february the company is limited in the amounts of funds that can be transferred from its subsidiaries through intercompany loans  advances  or cash dividends 
these limitations result from the restrictions contained in trust indentures under debt financing arrangements to which the company s education lending subsidiaries are parties 
the company does not believe these limitations will affect its operating cash needs 
the amounts of cash and investments restricted in the respective reserve accounts of the education lending subsidiaries are shown on the balance sheets as restricted cash and investments

branding partners are from whom the company acquires student loans and to whom the company provides marketing and origination services 
forward flow lenders are from whom the company acquires student loans and to whom the company provides origination services 
these commitments generally run for periods ranging from one to five years and are generally renewable 
the company was committed to extend credit or was obligated to purchase million of student loans at current market rates at the respective sellers requests under various agreements 
on december   the company purchased edulinx in a business combination for million 
an additional payment of approximately million is to be paid by the company if edulinx obtains an extension or renewal of a significant customer servicing contract that currently expires in february this contingency payment is due following the date on which such extension or renewal period of the servicing contract commences

loans for borrowers who have temporarily ceased making full payments due to hardship or other factors  according to a schedule approved by the servicer consistent with the established loan program servicing procedures and policies 
the period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due and relate to repayment loans  that is  receivables not charged off  and not in school  grace  deferment  or forbearance 
loans delinquent days or greater include loans in claim status  which are loans which have gone into default and have been submitted to the guaranty agency for ffelp loans  or the insurer for non federally insured loans  to process the claim for payment 
during  the company reclassified ffelp loans and the related allowance that have been rejected for reimbursement by the guarantor to the non federally insured loan portfolio  because these loans are effectively uninsured 
in the above tables  the reclassification is reflected for all periods presented 
origination and acquisition the company s student loan portfolio increases through various channels  including originations through the direct channel and acquisitions through the branding partner channel  the forward flow channel  and spot purchases 
the company s portfolio also increases with the addition of portfolios acquired through business acquisitions 
one of the company s primary objectives is to focus on originations through the direct channel and acquisitions through the branding partner channel 
the company has extensive and growing relationships with many large financial and educational institutions that are active in the education finance industry 
the company s branding relationships and forward flow relationships include union bank  an entity under common control with the company  as well as many schools and national and regional financial institutions 
loss of a strong relationship  like that with a significant branding partner such as union bank  or with schools from which the company directly or indirectly acquires a significant volume of student loans  could result in an adverse effect on the volume derived from the branding partner channel

critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most critical that is  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has determined the only critical accounting policy is determining the level of the allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses on student loans 
this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on its federally insured loan portfolio separately from its non federally insured loan portfolio 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
the federal government guarantees of principal and interest of federally insured student loans  which limits the company s loss exposure to of the outstanding balance of the company s federally insured portfolio 
effective june   the company was designated as an exceptional performer by the department in recognition of its exceptional level of performance in servicing ffel program loans 
as a result of this designation  the company receives reimbursement on all eligible ffel program default claims submitted for reimbursement during the month period following the effective date of its designation 
the company is not subject to the risk sharing loss for eligible claims submitted during this month period 
only ffel program loans that are serviced by the company  as well as loans owned by the company and serviced by other service providers designated as exceptional performers by the department  are subject to the reimbursement 
as of december   service providers designated as an exceptional performer serviced more than of the company s federally insured loans 
of this  third parties serviced approximately 
the company is entitled to receive this benefit as long as it and or its other service providers continue to meet the required servicing standards published by the department 
compliance with such standards is assessed on a quarterly basis 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  months in repayment  delinquency status  type of program  and trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data 
the company charges off these uninsured loans when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes

 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb no 

apb no 
provides an exception to the basic measurement principle fair value for exchanges of similar assets  requiring that some nonmonetary exchanges be recorded on a carryover basis 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance  that is  transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exchanges of nonmonetary assets occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  as of december   management believes that sfas no

sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting under the provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
generally resulting in recognition of no compensation expense and instead requires a company to recognize in its financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for valuable equity instruments issued  and liabilities incurred  to employees in share based payment transactions 
the cost will be based on the grant date fair value of the award and will be recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
for public entities that do not file as small business issuers  the provisions of the revised statement are to be applied prospectively for awards that are granted  modified  or settled in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  because the company does not issue share based payments to employees that are accounted for under apb no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in its borrowing and lending rates  the spread between which could impact the company due to shifts in market interest rates 
because the company generates the majority of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet is a key profitability driver 
the majority of student loans have variable rate characteristics in certain interest rate environments 
some of the student loans include fixed rate components depending upon the rate reset provisions  or  in the case of consolidation loans  are fixed at the weighted average interest rate of the underlying loans at the time of consolidation 
the following table sets forth the company s loan assets and debt instruments by rate characteristics as of december  as of december  dollars percent dollars percent dollars in thousands fixed rate loan assets   variable rate loan assets   total   fixed rate debt instruments   variable rate debt instruments   total   the following table shows the company s student loan assets currently earning at a fixed rate as of december  borrower estimated lender variable current fixed interest weighted conversion balance of rate range average yield rate a fixed rate assets dollars in thousands floor yield  a the estimated variable conversion rate is the estimated short term interest rate at which loans would convert to variable rate 
historically  the company has followed a policy of funding the majority of its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in a low interest rate environment  the ffelp loan portfolio yields excess income primarily due to the reduction in interest rates on the variable rate liabilities that fund student loans at a fixed borrower rate and also due to consolidation loans earning interest at a fixed rate to the borrower 
therefore  absent utilizing derivative instruments  in a low interest rate environment  a rise in interest rates will have an adverse effect on earnings 
in higher interest rate environments  where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and the fixed rate loans become variable rate and are effectively matched with variable rate debt  the impact of rate fluctuations is substantially reduced 
the company attempts to match the interest rate characteristics of pools of loan assets with debt instruments of substantially similar characteristics  particularly in rising interest rate environments 
due to the variability in duration of the company s assets and varying market conditions  the company does not attempt to perfectly match the interest rate characteristics of the entire loan portfolio with the underlying debt instruments 
the company has adopted a policy of periodically reviewing the mismatch related to the interest rate characteristics of its assets and liabilities and the company s outlook as to current and future market conditions 
based on those factors  the company will periodically use derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy to manage risk arising from its fixed rate and variable rate financial instruments

the interest rate swap converts a portion of the company s variable rate debt equal to the notional amount of the swap to a fixed rate for a period of time  fixing the relative spread between a portion of the company s student loan assets and the converted fixed rate liability 
b a basis swap is an interest rate swap agreement in which the company agrees to pay a floating rate in exchange for another floating rate  based upon different market indices 
the company has employed basis swaps to limit its sensitivity to dramatic fluctuations in the underlying indices used to price a portion of its variable rate assets and variable rate debt 
c a floating fixed swap is an interest rate swap in which the company agrees to pay a floating rate in exchange for a fixed rate 
the interest rate swap converts a portion of the company s fixed rate debt equal to the notional amount of the swap to a floating rate for a period of time 
d fair value is determined from market quotes from independent security brokers 
fair value indicates an estimated amount the company would receive pay if the contracts were cancelled or transferred to other parties 
derivative instruments that are currently used as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps and basis swaps 
the company accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by sfas no 
are met 
management has structured all of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the majority of the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 consequently  the change in fair value of these derivative instruments is included in the company s operating results 
as of december   the company accounted for one interest rate swap with a notional amount of million as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 
gains and losses on the effective portion of this qualifying hedge are accumulated in other comprehensive income and reclassified to current period earnings over the period in which the stated hedged transactions impact earnings 
ineffectiveness is recorded to earnings through interest expense

the effect on earnings was performed on the company s variable rate assets and liabilities 
the analysis includes the effects of the derivative instruments in existence during these periods 
as a result of the company s interest rate management activities  primarily initiated in  the company expects the change in pre tax net income resulting from basis point and basis point increases in interest rates will not result in a proportional decrease in net income

the company has historically provided information concerning the difference between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or repricing during specific future time intervals interest rate gap analysis 
management believes the table above provides a better perspective of the company s interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange risk the company purchased edulinx in december edulinx is a canadian corporation that engages in servicing canadian student loans 
as a result of this acquisition  the company is exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us and canadian dollars 
the company has not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge this risk 
however  the company does not believe fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will have a significant effect on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company
