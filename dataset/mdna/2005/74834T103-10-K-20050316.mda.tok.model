item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion about costs associated with this purchase and related move 
item legal proceedings on july   computer associates international  inc ca filed a complaint against us and four of our employees in the us district court for the northern district of illinois alleging copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation in connection with the development of our quest central for db product and seeking injunctive relief and unspecified money damages 
the complaint was amended in may to add another quest employee as a defendant and to assert breach of contract claims against three of the individual defendants 
in july  the court entered an order preliminarily enjoining our use  marketing  licensing or distribution of quest central for db  pending trial  based upon its determination that ca is likely to prove its claims of copyright infringement or trade secret misappropriation 
we are permitted by the terms of the order to continue providing technical support and product maintenance to existing users of quest central for db our appeal of the preliminary injunction order is pending 
the related products accounted for approximately of total revenues in the six months ended june  and the year ended december  we have established a loss contingency reserve in the amount of million  which reflects our current estimate of the value to quest of settling this litigation and removing the injunction so that we could promptly resume selling our quest central for db products 
we are engaged in settlement discussions with computer associates in connection with a mediation process initiated by the seventh circuit court of appeals 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach a settlement on terms and conditions acceptable to quest or at all 
if settlement discussions do not result in a settlement  we will continue to incur substantial legal expenses in the appeal of the preliminary injunction order and defense of these claims  which may also divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business 
the securities class action litigation filed in july and described in our filings since then was dismissed with prejudice at no cost to the company other than our litigation defense costs 
the related state derivative action was also dismissed in february we are a party to other litigation  which we consider to be routine and incidental to our business 
management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in the normal course of our business  we enter into certain types of agreements that require us to indemnify or guarantee the obligations of other parties 
these commitments include i intellectual property indemnities to licensees of our software products  ii indemnities to certain lessors under office space leases for certain claims arising from our use or occupancy of the related premises  or for the obligations of our subsidiaries under leasing arrangements  iii indemnities to customers  vendors and service providers for claims based on negligence or willful misconduct of our employees and agents  and iv indemnities to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law 
the terms and duration of these commitments varies and  in some cases  may be indefinite  and certain of these commitments do not limit the maximum amount of future payments we could become obligated to make thereunder  accordingly  our actual aggregate maximum exposure related to these types of commitments cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not been obligated to make significant payments for obligations of this nature  and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations in our financial statements included in this report as the estimated fair value of these obligations as of december  was considered nominal

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations md a also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
certain statements in this report  including statements regarding our business strategies  operations  financial conditions and prospects  are forward looking statements 
use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  will  contemplate  would and similar expressions that contemplate future events may identify forward looking statements 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect our operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report  including those described under risk factors  and in other filings with the sec  that attempt to advise interested parties of certain risks and factors that may affect our business 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which are based on current expectations and reflect management s opinions only as of the date thereof 
we do not assume any obligation to revise or update forward looking statements 
finally  our historic results should not be viewed as indicative of future performance 
overview and business model we are an independent software vendor of a broad portfolio of products that improve information technology operations 
we focus our efforts on products for widely adopted software platforms such as the oracle  ibm db and microsoft sql server database management systems  the microsoft windows server  active directory and exchange systems  the packaged enterprise software applications provided by companies such as sap  oracle  peoplesoft  siebel and the jee platform for custom application development 
products for the oracle databases were traditionally our core product set 
over the last three years  the revenue contribution from oracle database only products has declined as a percentage of total revenues because of reduced revenues from our high availability and quest central for oracle products and because of our efforts to build and acquire products outside of the oracle database market  especially in the areas of application performance management and microsoft windows management 
additional information about our products can be found under the discussion above under the heading business 
our revenue consists primarily of software license fees and maintenance fees from customers 
our software licensing model is primarily based on perpetual license fees  and our license fees are calculated either on a per server basis or a per seat basis  depending on the product 
maintenance contracts entitle a customer to technical support via telephone and the internet and unspecified maintenance releases  updates and enhancements 
first year maintenance contracts are typically sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
annual maintenance renewal fees are priced as a percentage of the net initial purchase fee of a perpetual license and first year post contract support 
maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
we also provide consulting and training services  which relate to installation of our products and do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
consulting and training service revenues are recognized as the services are performed and represent approximately of total services revenues 
we invest heavily in r d in order to design and develop a wide variety of products and technologies that will be attractive to customers 
in addition  we are a direct sales driven organization that expends significant selling costs in order to secure new customer license sales and the follow on maintenance revenue stream that can continue forward beyond the initial license sale year 
trends in our business as discussed in more detail throughout our md a results of operations improved significantly from fiscal to fiscal and again from fiscal to fiscal this improvement is defined by an increase in total revenues  higher income from operations as a percentage of total revenues operating margin  higher income from operations and higher net income 

table of contents from to  total revenues increased to million and total expenses increased to million  resulting in an increase in operating margins of basis points from to  an increase in income from operations from million to million and an increase in net income from million to million 
from to  total revenues increased to million and total expenses increased to million  resulting in an increase in operating margins of basis points from to  an increase in income from operations from million to million and an increase in net income from million to million 
the operating margin included a gain of million from the sale of our vista plus output management product line  a litigation loss provision of million and in process research and development charges of million 
no such gains or charges were recorded in specific contributors to and revenue growth are discussed below 
in summary  our microsoft systems management products were the primary product contributor to revenue growth from to our development and deployment product family also contributed significantly to revenue growth in licenses and services revenue growth by our north american operations and rest of world operations  primarily europe  are provided below 
the north american operations were the largest contributor to absolute license and services revenue growth from to rest of world percentage license and services revenue growth was higher in these periods  except that both operations showed similar license revenue growth rates from to acquisitions contributed materially to revenue growth in and we acquired sitraka inc in november inclusion of a full year of sitraka s revenues in results compared to two months in our results contributed approximately million of the million increase in total revenues in we acquired aelita software corporation in march we estimate aelita s contribution to our total revenues at approximately million representing approximately one half of our absolute revenue growth in over results of operations from aelita  sitraka and other acquisitions are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
for more information concerning our acquisitions during the periods presented herein  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue to evaluate a variety of strategic investment and acquisition opportunities 
devaluation of the us dollar relative to non dollar currencies  primarily the euro and the british pound  contributed to total revenues and operating expenses growth in and as quantified in the revenues and operating expenses discussions below for each period 
our primary expenses are our personnel costs  which include compensation and benefits and costs of office facilities and travel and entertainment  which are a function of our world wide headcount 
we estimate that these personnel related costs represented approximately of total expenses in our headcount at the end of fiscal was approximately  compared to approximately  at the end of fiscal the acquisition of aelita accounted for approximately of the total increase in personnel in the quest organization during under the pending new accounting rules for stock based compensation  we will begin to expense outstanding and newly granted stock options in the quarter ending september  this will substantially increase our stock based compensation expense  a non cash expense  and will substantially reduce our operating margins 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  inclusion of the compensation cost related to the fair value of stock option grants in our financial results would have reduced net income from million to million and would have reduced net income from million to a million loss 
in september  we sold our vista plus output management product line and related assets and certain customer support obligations to open text corporation open text  for approximately million in cash 
the assets sold were primarily comprised of intellectual property  a customer list  contracts  certain receivables and fixed assets 
open text assumed certain customer support obligations of the vista plus output management product line  which resulted in an approximately million 
table of contents reduction in deferred revenues on our september  balance sheet 
the sale resulted in a pretax gain of approximately million 
the vista plus output management product line generated approximately million and million in total revenues in and through the first nine months of  respectively  the bulk of which was maintenance revenue 
this disposition enables quest to increase our focus on our core application  database and infrastructure management markets 
in  we expect to continue to grow licenses and services revenues 
we expect this growth to continue to be weighted toward a stronger fourth quarter  similar to the last several years 
this generally means that operating income margins are expected to be lower than the full year average in early quarters and higher than average in the fourth quarter 
we expanded our asia pacific sales capabilities and added offices in five regions china  korea  hong kong  singapore and malaysia during we also expect to continue to expand our direct sales footprint by adding sales representatives and pre sales personnel in existing geographies 
we expect that these various investments will take time to bear results 
although our investments in a broader field sales presence have generally been successful  most notably in europe  there can be no assurance that future efforts will achieve the same result

table of contents comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenues total revenues and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except for percentages increase dollars percentage revenues licenses north america rest of world total license revenues services north america rest of world total service revenues total revenues licenses revenues growth in license revenues for the twelve months ended december   is primarily a result of robust sales within our microsoft systems management and development and deployment product lines 
the license revenue contribution from the acquired aelita products has become less identifiable because we have created product suites comprising both aelita and quest microsoft systems management products and because in some cases aelita products have replaced comparable quest products 
we nonetheless estimate that acquired aelita products contributed approximately to license revenues growth from to we also noted particular strength of the sales of aelita products in emea 
the microsoft windows management products now represent approximately of total software license sales for the year ended december  software license sales of our development and deployment products increased approximately from to  and these products also showed particular strength in europe 
a major new release of our toad oracle database development product was a primary driver of license revenues growth in this product line 
in the twelve months ended december   the decline of the us dollar against the euro and british pound contributed approximately million to the year over year increase in license revenues 
our currency adjusted license revenue growth rate would have been  compared to the mentioned above 
services revenues the largest component of service revenues is maintenance revenue 
services revenues also include fees for consulting and training services 
three factors were the primary contributors to our growth in services revenues 
first  aelita contributed approximately million in maintenance revenue for the year ended december  second  maintenance revenues from renewals of annual maintenance agreements have continued to grow 
third  revenues from post sales consulting and training increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
post sales consulting and training as a percentage of total service revenues represented and in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
in the twelve months ended december   devaluation of the us dollar against the euro and british pound contributed approximately million to the year over year increase in services revenues 
our currency adjusted services revenue growth rate would have been  compared to mentioned above 
as our software maintenance customer base grows  the renewal rate has a larger influence on the software maintenance revenue growth rate and the amount of new software license revenues has a diminishing effect 
therefore  the growth rate of software maintenance revenues does not necessarily correlate directly to the growth rate of new software license revenues in a given period 
the primary determinant of changes in our software maintenance revenue profile is the rate at which our customers renew their annual maintenance and support agreements 
if our maintenance renewal rates were to decline materially  our maintenance revenues and total revenues would likely decline materially as well 
although we do not currently expect our maintenance renewal rates to deteriorate  there can be no assurance they will not

the percentage of revenue decrease is primarily the result of reduced license sales of royalty bearing products 
cost of services cost of services primarily consists of personnel  outside consultants  facilities and systems costs used in providing support  consulting and training services

amortization of other purchased intangible assets amortization of other purchased intangible assets includes the amortization of customer lists  trademarks  non compete agreements and maintenance contracts associated with acquisitions 
the increase in amortization expense is due to the purchase of intangible assets in conjunction with acquisitions during the first two quarters of we expect amortization of other purchased intangible assets to be at least million in the year ending other income  net other income  net includes interest income on our investment portfolio  and gains and losses from foreign exchange fluctuations  as well as gains or losses on other financial assets 
other income  net increased by million to million in the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the comparable period of this increase is due to an impairment charge included in other income in of million relating to our investment in an aircraft 
the increase is partially offset by lower foreign currency gains in foreign currency gains were million and million in and  respectively

table of contents our cash flows from operations were primarily derived from i our earnings from operations prior to non cash expenses  which were then adjusted for gains or losses resulting from sale or impairment of assets  ii the addback of depreciation and amortization costs  which represent a non cash expense  which contributed between million and million per year to cash flow over the to period  iii the tax benefit related to stock options exercised  which reduces our cash outlay for income tax expense  and iv changes in our working capital 
working capital changes are mostly driven by deferred revenue representing net cash inflows of million  million and million in the  and periods  respectively  which primarily represent the receipt of cash payments for maintenance support  which will be delivered over the coming twelve month period 
this substantial cash inflow is partially offset by growth in accounts receivable of million and million over the last two years 
the increase in receivables is the result of both our overall revenue growth as well as growth in our european geography  which generally has longer payment terms with customers 
in the future  we expect cash will continue to be generated from our operations

the purchase price is subject to increase by one half percent for each thirty day period after november  until the completion of the purchase  which is expected to occur in may we exercised our option to lease back approximately  square feet of this building back to the seller 
we intend to move our remaining irvine operations into this new building in stages over the next three quarters 
we expect costs of improvements for this new building to be approximately million to million 
financing activities our primary sources of financing cash flows are from a repurchase agreement and issuances of our common stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
our primary use of cash from financing activities is for repayment of our repurchase agreement  as described below  and repayment of notes payable

the cash proceeds of this transaction were used to provide funding for our acquisition of aelita and our purchase of a new office facility 
our remaining obligation under this agreement was paid in full in february our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to five million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
no shares of common stock were repurchased under this plan during or based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  investment balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital  building and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next to months

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules  which require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions  if any  must be deferred 
we analyze various factors  including our pricing policies  the credit worthiness of our customers  contractual terms and conditions  our historical experience and market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
our revenues consist of software license revenues  maintenance revenues and professional services revenues 
our revenue recognition policies for these revenue categories are as follows 
almost all of our software license revenues are from sales of perpetual licenses 
the fee for one year of maintenance and support services is included in the initial purchase fee for a perpetual license of a quest product  so that the purchase of a perpetual license with first year maintenance and support services is a multi element arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
we offer customers the right to purchase maintenance and support services on a standalone basis for annual periods beyond the first year 
we account for the perpetual license component of these multiple element arrangements using the residual method 
the residual method generally requires recognition of software license revenue in a multiple element arrangement once all software products have been delivered and accepted by the customer and the only undelivered element is pcs post contract support  or maintenance and or certain services 
the value of the undelivered maintenance services is determined based on vsoe vendor specific  objective evidence and is deferred and recorded to revenue ratably over the maintenance term 
the residual revenue is allocated to the license fees associated with the software product or products being licensed in the transaction 
our maintenance and support services vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to the price our customers are required to pay for the services when sold separately  that is  the maintenance and support renewal fees paid by our customers 
annual maintenance and support renewal fees are generally priced as a percentage of the initial discounted purchase price and are recognized ratably over the maintenance periods  generally one year 
in addition to perpetual licenses  we sell a small amount of subscription software licenses each year 
less than of total revenue was generated by subscription software licenses 
software subscriptions are term based and the customer pays a single fee for the right to use the software and receive maintenance and support 
table of contents services for the term 
a subscription sale s license and maintenance and support fee components are both deferred and recognized ratably over the license term 
our professional services fees are generally derived from time and materials based contracts that typically range on average from five to fifteen days in duration 
these services are generally implementation and training services 
revenue is recognized on such contracts as work is performed 
we sell our professional services both standalone and as part of multi element arrangements 
when professional services are sold as part of a multi element arrangement  vsoe of fair value is based on established pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately 
historically  we have been able to establish vsoe for customer support and professional services  but we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in  or the inability to support  vsoe of fair value for these undelivered elements 
if this occurs  our future revenue recognition for multi element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results 
if in the future we were unable to support vsoe of fair value for an undelivered element  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement would be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of our customers to make required payments 
this requires us to make estimates of future product returns  annual support cancellations and write offs of bad debt accounts related to current period revenues 
the amount of our reserves is based on historical experience and our current analysis of the collectability of accounts receivable 
as a percentage of total revenues  charges against sales returns allowances for bad debt  sales returns and annual support cancellations were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
additionally  if significant product performance issues were to arise resulting in our accepting sales returns  additional allowances may be required which would result in a reduction of revenue in the period such determination was made 
our standard licensing agreement does not permit customers to return products unless we have breached the product warranty and are unable to cure the breach 
our product warranties are typical industry warranties that a product will perform in accordance with established product requirements 
while such amounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
goodwill goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we performed our annual impairment review and  as a result  determined that the carrying value of each reporting unit was less than the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units licenses and services  the market approach guideline company method was the methodology deemed the most reliable and used for impairment analysis 
we will perform subsequent annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of each year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
future impairment reviews may result in charges against earnings to write down the value of goodwill 
other intangible assets these assets are recorded at the appraised value and amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of two years to seven years 
the net carrying amount of other intangible assets was considered recoverable at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 these intangible assets are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the carrying value of these assets to 
table of contents determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred 
in the event that in the future it is determined that the other intangible assets value has been impaired  an adjustment will be made resulting in a charge for the write down in the period in which the determination is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
us and foreign tax returns are subject to routine compliance reviews by the various tax authorities 
we accrue for tax contingencies based upon our best estimate of the taxes we expect to pay 
these estimates are updated over time as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  completion of tax audits or upon occurrence of other events 
the tax contingency accrual is recorded as a component of our net income taxes payable receivable balance 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of the recognition of certain revenue items and the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time periods within which the underlying timing differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which could result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
us income taxes were not provided for on undistributed earnings from certain non us subsidiaries 
those earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested

table of contents risk factors an investment in our shares involves risks and uncertainties 
you should carefully consider the factors described below before making an investment decision in our securities 
the risks described below are the risks that we currently believe are material risks of business and the industry in which we compete 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the following risks 
if we are adversely affected by such risks  then the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods and  as a result  we may fail to meet expectations of investors and analysts  causing our stock price to fluctuate or decline our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
these factors include the following the size and timing of customer orders 
see the size and timing of our customer orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter which could cause fluctuations in our revenues 
the discretionary nature of our customers purchasing decisions and budget cycles  the timing of revenue recognition for sales of software products and services  the extent to which our customers renew their maintenance contracts with us  exposure to general economic conditions and reductions in corporate it spending  changes in our level of operating expenses and our ability to control costs  our ability to attain market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements to our existing products  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  the relative growth rates of competing operating system  database and application platforms  the unpredictability of the timing and level of sales through our indirect sales channels  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  including amortization costs for intangible assets with indefinite lives  and the timing of releases of new versions of third party software products that our products support or with which our products compete 
fluctuations in our results of operations are likely to affect the market price of our common stock and may not be related to or indicative of our long term performance

these reductions in our operating results may result in a reduction to our stock price and market value  the magnitude of which cannot be determined 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contain a detailed presentation of our current methods of accounting for stock based compensation plans and includes pro forma fair value disclosures currently required under sfas no 
the size and timing of our customer orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter which could cause fluctuations in our revenues and operating results our license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and delivered in that quarter 
our revenues in a given quarter could be adversely affected if we are unable to complete one or more large license agreements  or if the contract terms were to prevent us from recognizing revenue during that quarter 
the sales cycles for certain of our software products  such as shareplex  can last from three to nine months and often require pre purchase evaluation periods and customer education  which can affect timing of orders 
further  we have often booked a large amount of our sales in the last month  weeks or days of each quarter and delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenue to fall short of anticipated levels 
finally  while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from previously deferred revenue  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
these factors may cause significant periodic variation in our license revenues 
in addition  we incur or commit to operating expenses based on anticipated revenue levels  and generally do not know whether revenues in any quarter will meet expectations until the end of that quarter 
accordingly  if our revenue growth rates slow or our revenues decline  our operating results could be seriously impaired because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in nature and cannot be easily or quickly changed 
general economic conditions and reduced levels of corporate it spending may continue to affect revenue growth rates and impact our business our business and operating results are subject to the effects of changes in general economic conditions 
recent unfavorable economic conditions have resulted in continued reduced corporate it spending in the industries that we serve and a softening of demand for computer software  not only in the database and application market segments we support but also in the product segment in which we compete 
if these economic conditions do not improve  or we experience continued deterioration in general economic conditions or further reduced corporate it spending  our business and operating results could continue to be adversely impacted 
many of our products are vulnerable to direct competition from oracle we compete with oracle in the market for database management solutions and the competitive pressure continues to increase 
we expect that oracle s commitment to and presence in the database management product market will increase in the future and therefore substantially increase competitive pressures 
we believe that oracle will continue to incorporate database management technology into its server software offerings  possibly at no additional cost to its users 
competition from oracle with certain of our database management products including shareplex and quest central for oracle has increased over the last two years and has continued to increase with oracle s introduction of the next version of its database  known as oracle g 
oracle g has enhanced capabilities in the functions competitive with shareplex  quest central for oracle and with the oracle monitoring capabilities of foglight 
we believe increased competition from oracle has materially depressed our shareplex and quest central for oracle revenues over the last three years 
in some cases these platform vendor provided tools are bundled with the platform and in other cases they are separately chargeable products  albeit at significantly lower price points 
the inclusion of the functionality of 
table of contents our software as standard features of the underlying database solution or application supported by our products or sale at much lower cost could erode our revenues  particularly if the competing products and features were of comparable capability to our products 
even if the functionality provided as standard features or lower costs by these system providers is more limited than that of our software  there can be no assurance that a significant number of customers would not elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing our products 
moreover  there is substantial risk that the mere announcements of competing products or features by large competitors such as oracle could result in the delay or cancellation of customer orders for our products in anticipation of the introduction of such new products or features 
our migration products for microsoft s active directory and exchange are vulnerable to fluctuations in the rate at which customers of certain microsoft products migrate to newer versions of such products 
our products for the migration  administration and management of microsoft s active directory and exchange products currently contribute approximately one third of our revenue from software license sales and have been the primary contributors to license revenue growth in fiscal and our ability to sell licenses for our active directory and exchange migration products depends in part on the rate at which customers migrate to newer versions of microsoft s windows or windows xp operating system or to newer versions of microsoft exchange 
if these migration rates were to materially decrease  our license revenues from these migration products would likely decline 
many of our products are dependent on database or application technologies of others  if these technologies lose market share or become incompatible with our products  or if these vendors introduce competitive products or acquire or form strategic relationships with our competitors  the demand for our products could suffer we believe that our success has depended in part  and will continue to depend in part for the foreseeable future  upon our relationships with providers of major database and enterprise software programs  including oracle  ibm  microsoft  sap  siebel and peoplesoft 
our competitive advantage consists in substantial part on the integration between our products and products provided by these major software providers  and our extensive knowledge of their products and technologies 
if these companies for any reason decide to promote technologies and standards that are not compatible with our technologies  or if they lose market share for their database or application products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  these major software vendors could attempt to increase their presence in the markets we serve by either introducing products that compete with our products or acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors 
these companies have longer operating histories  larger installed bases of customers and substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and technical resources than we do  as well as well established relationships with many of our present and potential customers  and may be in better position to withstand and respond to the current factors impacting this industry 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies in the future  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced products that achieve widespread market acceptance our future success depends on our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and introducing new products  product updates and services on a timely basis  by extending the operation of our products on new platforms and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
to grow our business  we are committing substantial resources to developing software products and services for the applications management market 
if this market does not continue to develop as anticipated  or demand for our products in this market does not materialize or occurs more slowly than we expect  or if our development efforts are delayed or unsuccessful  we will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenues  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect the price of our common stock pursuant to rules adopted by the sec implementing section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and report whether such internal controls are effective 
our auditors must issue an attestation report on such assessment 
accordingly  we have undertaken to evaluate  test and remediate  if necessary  our internal controls pursuant to a clearly defined internal plan and schedule 
although we believe that our efforts will enable us to provide the required report and our independent auditors to provide the required attestation as of the end of each fiscal year  there can be no assurance that our assessment will conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
for example  our management s assessment for the year ended december  identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to our calculations for the provision of income taxes 
as a result  our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of our fiscal see management s report on internal control over financial reporting in item a of this report for more information on this matter 
this material weakness  and any future weakness or deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
intense competition in the markets for our products could adversely affect our results of operations 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
as a result  our future success will be affected by our ability to  among other things  outperform our competitors in meeting the needs of current and prospective customers and identifying and addressing new technological and market opportunities 
our competitors may develop more advanced technology  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and undertake more effective sales and marketing campaigns and may be able to leverage more extensive financial  technical or partner resources 
if we are unable to maintain our competitive position  our revenues may decline and our operating results may be adversely affected 
our operating results may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates our international operations are generally conducted through our international subsidiaries  with the associated revenues and related expenses  and balance sheets  denominated in the currency of the country in which the international subsidiaries operate 
as a result  our operating results may be harmed by fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other foreign currencies 
the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro and the australian dollar 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international operations and our planned expansion of our international operations expose us to certain risks we maintain research and development operations in canada  australia  israel and russia  and continue to expand our international sales activities as part of our business strategy 
as a result  we face increasing risks from our international operations  including  among others difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity in europe  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities  potentially adverse tax consequences  
table of contents potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  delays in localizing our products  political unrest or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities  our ability to adapt and conform to accepted local business practices and customs  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers 
operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources and will place additional burdens on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing them internationally 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business and diversion of management attention we have in the past made and we expect to continue to make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies  including our recent acquisition of aelita 
any additional acquisitions will require us to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition or may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
we may have to use cash  incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
use of cash or debt may affect our liquidity and use of cash would reduce our cash reserves 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our shareholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
in consummating acquisitions  we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
if we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies with our existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of an acquisition 
we face risks associated with governmental contracting we derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with the united states government and its agencies and from contracts with state and local governments or agencies 
demand and payment for our products and services are impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability  with funding reductions or delays adversely impacting public sector demand for our products and services 
public sector customers may also change the way they procure new contracts and may adopt new rules or regulations governing contract procurement  including required competitive bidding or use of open source products  where available 
these factors may limit the growth of or reduce the amount of revenues we derive from the public sector  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
our efforts to constrain costs may strain our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure we are focused on increasing our operating margins 
these efforts place a strain on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our ability to manage our operations while reducing operating costs requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and 
table of contents reporting systems and procedures 
although we achieved a year over year increase in our margins from the twelve months ended to the comparable period in  there can be no guarantees that we will be successful in achieving our profitability targets in any future quarterly or annual period 
we may not generate increased business from our current customers  which could slow our revenue growth in the future most of our customers initially make a purchase of our products for a single department or location 
many of these customers may choose not to expand their use of our products 
if we fail to generate expanded business from our current customers  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  as we deploy new modules and features for our existing products or introduce new products  our current customers may choose not to purchase this new functionality or these new products 
moreover  if customers elect not to renew their maintenance agreements  our service revenues would be materially adversely affected 
failure to develop strategic relationships could harm our business by denying us selling opportunities and other benefits our current collaborative relationships may not prove to be beneficial to us  and they may not be sustained 
we also may not be able to enter into successful new strategic relationships in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could lose sales opportunities if we fail to work effectively with these parties 
moreover  we expect that maintaining and enhancing these and other relationships will become a more meaningful part of our business strategy in the future 
however  many of our current partners are either actual or potential competitors with us 
in addition  many of these third parties also work with competing software companies and we may not be able to maintain these existing relationships  due to the fact that these relationships are informal or  if written  are terminable with little or no notice 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we generally rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  patent  copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such resulting litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and financial resources  which could harm our business 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may prove to be inadequate and competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we also believe that  because of the rapid rate of technological change in the software industry  trade secret and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of customer support services 
third parties may claim that our software products or services infringe on their intellectual property rights  exposing us to litigation that  regardless of merit  may be costly to defend our success and ability to compete are also dependent on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual 
table of contents property rights 
any such claim  with or without merit  could have a significant effect on our business and financial results 
see legal proceedings in part i  item  of this report  for information concerning copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation claims initiated against quest by computer associates international  inc this and any future third party claim could be time consuming  divert management s attention from our business operations and result in substantial litigation costs  including any monetary damages and customer indemnification obligations  which may result from such claims 
in addition  parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief affecting our ability to license the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property 
as a result of such claims  we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties  develop alternative technology or redesign our products 
we cannot be sure that such licenses would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if a successful claim is made against us and we are unable to develop or license alternative technology  our business and financial results and position could be materially adversely affected 
an unfavorable outcome in our litigation with computer associates international  inc could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations in july  computer associates international  inc ca initiated a lawsuit against us and certain of our employees alleging copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation in connection with the development of our quest central for db product and seeking injunctive relief and unspecified money damages 
in july  the court entered an order enjoining our use  marketing  licensing or distribution of quest central for db  pending trial  based upon its determination that ca is likely to prove its claims of copyright infringement or trade secret misappropriation 
in addition to the interruption of business and diversion of management s attention caused by this injunction  our continuing defense of this lawsuit will be time consuming for our senior management and is likely to result in significant litigation costs regardless of the outcome 
an unfavorable outcome to this lawsuit may impose monetary damages 
we have established a loss contingency reserve in the amount of million reflecting our current estimate of the value to quest of settling this litigation and removing the injunction so that we could promptly resume selling our quest central for db products 
we are engaged in settlement discussions with computer associates in connection with a mediation process initiated by the seventh circuit court of appeals 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach a settlement on terms and conditions acceptable to quest or at all 
if settlement discussions do not result in a settlement  we will continue to incur substantial legal expenses in the appeal of the preliminary injunction order and defense of these claims  which may also divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business 
litigation is uncertain and there can be no guarantee that this amount will be sufficient to cover our ultimate liability in this matter  if any 
in addition  the uncertainty created by the injunction or the lawsuit may negatively affect our relationships with existing customers or give rise to customer claims for indemnification and may discourage prospective customers  particularly those using db udb among other major database platforms and seeking a heterogeneous database management solution  from licensing our software products 
our business will suffer if our software contains errors the software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our operating margins could be harmed 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  
table of contents failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could harm our business by increasing our costs and distracting our management 
we incorporate software licensed from third parties into some of our products and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could reduce the demand for  or prevent the shipping of  our products certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors 
we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm our sales unless and until we can secure an alternative source 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology licensed to us  such alternate sources may not provide us with the same functionality as that currently provided to us 
natural disasters or power outages could disrupt our business a substantial portion of our operations is located in california  and we are subject to risks of damage and business disruptions resulting from earthquakes  floods  fires and similar events  as well as from power outages 
we have in the past experienced limited and temporary power losses in our california facilities due to power shortages  and we expect in the future to experience additional power losses 
while the impact to our business and operating results has not been material  we cannot assure you that power losses will not adversely affect our business in the future  or that the cost of acquiring sufficient power to run our business will not increase significantly 
since we do not have sufficient redundancy in our networking infrastructure  a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem could have an adverse effect on our business  including both our internal operations and our ability to communicate with our customers or sell and deliver our products 
the demand for our products will depend on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we transact business in a number of different foreign countries around the world 
generally  revenues are collected and operating expenses are paid in the local currency of the country in which we are transacting 
accordingly  we are exposed to volatility in sales and earnings within these countries due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in non us dollar currencies 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
our cumulative currency gains or losses in any given period may be lessened by the economic benefits of diversification 
the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro and the australian dollar 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposures  nor do we use such instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we regularly monitor the potential cost and benefits of hedging foreign exchange exposures with derivatives and there remains the possibility that our foreign exchange hedging practices could change accordingly in time
