item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements for eastman chemical company eastman or the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
all references to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the company s management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  impaired assets  environmental costs  us pension and other postemployment benefits  litigation and contingent liabilities  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s management believes the critical accounting policies described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the company s financial condition and results 
these policies require management s more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company believes  based on historical results  the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results or earnings per share is low 
however  if one of the company s key customers were to file for bankruptcy  or otherwise be unable to make its required payments  or there was a significant continued slow down in the economy  the company could be forced to increase its allowances 
this could result in a material charge to earnings 
the company s allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
impaired assets the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the asset  adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  significant changes in business climate  or current or projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such assets are separately identifiable and are less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
for long lived assets to be held and used  fair value of fixed tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or appraisal 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than by sale  fair value is determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs 
as the company s assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change  additional write downs may be required in the future 
if estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised  the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted  resulting in a charge to earnings 
the company recorded fixed tangible asset impairments of million and definite lived intangible asset impairments of million and indefinite lived intangible asset impairments of million during

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental costs the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the company also establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains 
environmental assets include but are not limited to land fills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed  a reserve is established for the future environmental costs anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site based on an expected life of the environmental assets 
these future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
currently  the company estimates the useful life of each individual asset up to years 
if the company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets  the future expenses to be charged into earnings could increase or decrease 
the company s reserve for environmental contingencies was million and million at december  and  respectively  representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and  for asset retirement obligation costs  the amount accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives 
united states pension and other postemployment benefits the company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits 
additionally  eastman provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase for employees and health care cost trends 
at december   the company assumed a discount rate of  an expected return on assets of  a rate of compensation increase of  and an initial health care cost trend of decreasing to an ultimate trend rate of in the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for us pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans change in assumption impact on pre tax us pension expense impact on december  projected benefit obligation for us pension plans impact on december  benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans basis point decrease in discount rate million million million basis point increase in discount rate million million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million no impact n a basis point increase in expected return on assets million no impact n a the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the company s pension and other postemployment benefit obligations are established each december the expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds  primarily the domestic  international  and private equities markets 
the assumed discount rate is based upon an index of high quality  long term corporate borrowing rates 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the difference is recorded as an unrecognized gain loss and then amortized into earnings over a period of time  which may cause the cost of providing these benefits to increase or decrease 
the charges applied to earnings in   and due to the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses were million  million  and million  respectively 
the company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during however  an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  as of december  for the impact on the pension s projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates  if any 
while the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements  it is an indication of the amount the company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years 
the amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates  actual returns on plan assets  retirement  and attrition rates of employees  and other factors 
litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  the company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  asbestos  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
the company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters  however  results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million has been provided against the deferred tax assets 
overview since the beginning of  the company has been implementing a turnaround strategy to improve profitability  which included an evaluation of its portfolio and implementation of initiatives to reduce costs 
in  the evaluation led to restructuring  divestitures  and consolidation within the company  including the sale of underperforming businesses  product lines and related assets within the company s coatings  adhesives  specialty polymers  and inks caspi segment  the rationalization of capacity and consolidation of production in the specialty plastics sp segment  the implementation of a more integrated organizational structure in the polymers segment  and restructuring of the developing businesses db segment 
these actions resulted in asset impairments and restructuring charges in of million 
further  in january  the company announced that it has entered into an agreement with danisco a s to sell eastman s equity interest in genencor international  inc  genencor  which is targeted for first quarter and is expected to be completed by may  in full year  operating earnings were million  an improvement from the million operating loss in and the best since these results included the impact of asset impairments and restructuring charges and a tax benefit received  both described in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
the improved results were also accomplished through increased sales volume primarily attributed to a strengthening economy  new applications of certain products and increased substitution of polyethylene terephthalate pet polymers for other materials  increased selling prices  particularly in the performance chemicals and intermediates pci and polymers segments  a continued focus on more profitable businesses and product lines  particularly in the company s eastman division  ongoing labor and benefits reduction measures  and the application of process improvement technologies 
the company also improved its cash flow from operations in by million compared with the increased cash flow from operations  combined with proceeds from the divestiture of assets  resulted in the reduction of net debt long and short term debt minus cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
in addition  during the company continued to maintain its financial discipline while improving profitability 
this was demonstrated by keeping selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses below percent of sales revenue  having capital expenditures below depreciation and amortization  and maintaining a strong dividend 
the company has also taken several initiatives to continue to improve margins in  including the improvement of pricing processes and pricing strategies  particularly to recover historically high costs of raw materials and energy  and reduction of the labor force by approximately percent 
these actions  combined with a strengthening economy  have positioned the company to enter a period of growth with increased profitability and financial flexibility

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset impairments and restructuring charges caspi segment in the third quarter  the company reorganized the operating structure within its caspi segment and changed the segment s business strategy in response to the financial performance of certain underlying product lines 
prior to the third quarter  management was pursuing growth strategies aimed at significantly improving the financial performance of these product groups 
however  due to the continued operating losses and deteriorating market conditions  management decided to pursue alternative strategies including restructuring  divestiture  and consolidation 
this change affected both the manner in which certain assets are used and the financial outlook for these product groups  thus triggering the impairments and certain restructuring charges 
the third quarter fixed asset impairment charges of approximately million primarily related to assets associated with the above mentioned underperforming product lines  and primarily impacted manufacturing sites in the north american and european regions that were part of the lawter international  inc lawter  mcwhorter technologies  inc 
mcwhorter  and chemicke zavody sokolov sokolov acquisitions 
within these product lines  nine sites in north america and six sites in europe were impaired 
as the undiscounted future cash flows could not support the carrying value of the assets  the fixed assets were written down to fair value  as established primarily by appraisal 
the third quarter intangible asset impairment charges related to definite lived intangible assets of approximately million and indefinite lived intangibles of approximately million 
the definite lived intangibles related primarily to developed technology and customer lists  and the indefinite lived intangibles primarily related to trademarks 
these intangible assets were primarily associated with the acquisitions of lawter and mcwhorter 
as the undiscounted future cash flows could not support the carrying value of the definite lived intangible assets  these assets were written down to fair value  as established primarily by appraisal 
indefinite lived intangible assets were written down to fair value  as established by appraisal 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company defined reporting units as one level below the operating segment level and considered the criteria set forth in sfas no 
in aggregating the reporting units 
this resulted in the caspi segment being deemed a single reporting unit 
in the third quarter  the reorganization of the operating structure within the caspi segment resulted in new reporting units one level below the operating segment 
due to the change in strategy and lack of similar economic characteristics  these reporting units did not meet the criteria necessary for aggregation 
as a result  the goodwill associated with the caspi segment was reassigned to the new reporting units based upon relative fair values 
the reporting unit that contained the above mentioned product lines was assigned million of goodwill out of the total caspi segment goodwill of million 
because the company determined that this reporting unit could no longer support the carrying value of its assigned goodwill  the full amount of that goodwill was impaired 
the fair value of the other reporting unit within caspi was sufficient to support the carrying value of the remainder of the goodwill 
in the fourth quarter  the company recognized fixed asset impairments and site closure costs of million and million  respectively 
the fixed asset impairments relate to additional impairments associated with the caspi reorganization  as discussed above 
the site closure charges relate primarily to additional costs related to the closure of the company s dusseldorf manufacturing site

on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
the jobs act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through the jobs act also provides for a two year phase out of the eti exclusion 
the domestic manufacturing benefit has no effect on deferred tax assets or liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the company s federal income tax return 
the company is currently assessing the details of the jobs act and the net effect of the phase out of the eti exclusion and the phase in of this new deduction 
this analysis is expected to be completed in mid until such time  it is not possible to determine what impact this legislation will have on the company s consolidated tax accruals or effective tax rate 
the act also creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations 
the company is not yet in a position to decide whether  and to what extent  foreign earnings might be repatriated 
based upon analysis to date  however  it is reasonably possible that some amount up to million might be repatriated considering the limitation under section b of the internal revenue code 
the related income tax effects of any such repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company has not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on million of undistributed earnings from non us operations as of december  until the company s analysis of the act is completed  the company will continue to permanently reinvest those earnings

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations narrow or limited purposes 
thus  eastman is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships 
the company has evaluated material relationships including the guarantees related to the third party borrowings of joint ventures described above and has concluded that the entities are not variable interest entities vies or  in the case of primester  a joint venture that manufactures cellulose acetate at its kingsport  tennessee plant  the company is not the primary beneficiary of the vie 
as such  in accordance with fin r  the company is not required to consolidate these entities 
in addition  the company has evaluated long term purchase obligations with two entities that may be vies at december  these potential vies are joint ventures from which the company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several years and purchases approximately million of raw materials and utilities on an annual basis 
the company has no equity interest in these entities and has confirmed that one party to each of these joint ventures does consolidate the potential vie 
however  due to competitive and other reasons  the company has not been able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine whether the entities are vies  and if one or both are vies  whether or not the company is the primary beneficiary 
in conjunction with the sale of certain businesses and product lines in the caspi segment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company accepted a variable interest in the form of a million note receivable 
the company has evaluated the material relationships with the purchasing entity and concluded the company is not the primary beneficiary 
the company s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the million book value of the note receivable and unpaid interest  if any 
guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers  customers  and non consolidated affiliates when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified triggering events occur 
non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company 
these potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products  intellectual property and environmental matters  and other indemnifications 
the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims 
however  while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized  management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with eastman s policies as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
because of expected sharing of costs  the availability of legal defenses  and the company s preliminary assessment of actions that may be required  it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters  individually or in the aggregate  will be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  in addition to remediation activities  the company establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains 
environmental assets include but are not limited to landfills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed  a reserve is established for the anticipated future environmental costs associated with the closure of the site asset based on its expected life 
these future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
reserves related to environmental assets accounted for approximately of the total environmental reserve at december  currently  the company s environmental assets are expected to be no longer useable at various different times over the next years 
if the company were to invest in numerous new environmental assets  or  these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the company anticipated they would  the amortization on them would increase  and could have a material negative impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote  and does not anticipate  based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation  that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary 
at december  and  the company had recognized environmental contingencies of approximately million and million  respectively  representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and  for closure postclosure costs  the amount accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives 
the company s estimated cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
cash expenditures estimated for are expected to remain at approximately million 
these amounts pertain primarily to operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities  but also include expenditures for construction and development 
the company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the company s planned level of capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 
inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a material adverse impact on eastman s costs 
the cost of raw materials is generally based on market price  although derivative financial instruments may have been utilized  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market price fluctuations

forward looking statements and risk factors the expectations under outlook and certain other statements in this annual report may be forward looking in nature as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the company from time to time may relate to  among other things  such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization  anticipated capital spending  expected depreciation and amortization  environmental matters  legal proceedings  exposure to  and effects of hedging of  raw material and energy costs and foreign currencies  global and regional economic  political  and business conditions  competition  growth opportunities  supply and demand  volume  price  cost  margin  and sales  earnings  cash flow  dividends and other expected financial conditions  expectations  strategies  and plans for individual assets and products  businesses  segments and divisions as well as for the whole of eastman chemical company  cash requirements and uses of available cash  financing plans  pension expenses and funding  credit ratings  anticipated restructuring  divestiture  and consolidation activities  cost reduction and control efforts and targets  integration of acquired businesses  development  production  commercialization and acceptance of new products  services and technologies and related costs  asset  business and product portfolio changes  and expected tax rates and net interest costs 
these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described in this report  the following are some of the important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements the company has deferred tax assets related to capital and operating losses 
the company establishes valuation allowances to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company s ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends on projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time 
as a result  changes in tax laws  assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is endeavoring to exploit growth opportunities in certain core businesses by developing new products  expanding into new markets  and tailoring product offerings to customer needs 
there can be no assurance that such efforts will result in financially successful commercialization of such products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets 
the company has made  and intends to continue making  strategic investments and enter into strategic alliances in technology  services businesses  and other ventures in order to build  diversify  and strengthen certain eastman capabilities and to maintain high utilization of manufacturing assets 
there can be no assurance that such investments will achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the company s results of operations 
the company owns assets in the form of equity in other companies  including joint ventures  technology investments and genencor 
such investments are minority investments in companies which are not managed or controlled by the company and are subject to all of the risks associated with changes in value of such investments including the market valuation of those companies whose shares are publicly traded 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such investments will achieve the intended underlying strategic business objectives 
the company has entered into an agreement with danisco a s under which danisco will acquire all of eastman s equity interest in genencor as part of danisco s acquisition of all the outstanding common stock of genencor 
in addition to being subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions  closing of the sale is also subject to the risk and uncertainties typically associated with such a public change in control transaction 
there can be no assurance that the sale will close in a timely manner or at all 
if the sale is not completed  available cash  and the company s priority for use thereof  would be adversely impacted 
the company has undertaken and will continue to undertake productivity and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve performance and generate cost savings 
there can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 
in addition to productivity and cost reduction initiatives  the company is striving to improve margins on its products through price increases where warranted and accepted by the market  however  the company s earnings could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized  not be sufficient to cover increased raw material and energy costs  or have a negative impact on demand and volume 
there can be no assurances that price increases will be realized or will be realized within the company s anticipated timeframe 
the company is reliant on certain strategic raw materials for its operations and utilizes risk management tools  including hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated 
in addition  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities  or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the company operates or does business  or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials  could affect availability and costs of raw materials 
while temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur  these items are generally sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements 
however  their continuous availability and price are impacted by plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand  domestic and world market and political conditions  changes in government regulation  and war or other outbreak of hostilities 
eastman s operations or products may  at times  be adversely affected by these factors

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s competitive position in the markets in which it participates is  in part  subject to external factors in addition to those that the company can impact 
for example  supply and demand for certain of the company s products is driven by end use markets and worldwide capacities which  in turn  impact demand for and pricing of the company s products 
the company has an extensive customer base  however  loss of certain top customers could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers 
in addition  the company s competitive position may be adversely impacted by low cost competitors in certain regions and customers developing internal or alternative sources of supply 
limitation of the company s available manufacturing capacity due to significant disruption in its manufacturing operations could have a material adverse affect on sales revenue  expenses and results of operations and financial condition 
the company s facilities and businesses are subject to complex health  safety and environmental laws and regulations  which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently and in the future 
the company s accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based 
the amount accrued reflects the company s assumptions about remedial requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
the company accesses the capital and credit markets on a regular basis 
access to these markets and the cost of capital is dependent in part upon the company s credit rating received from independent credit rating agencies 
an adverse change in the company s credit rating could affect the renewal of existing credit facilities or the company s ability to obtain access to new credit facilities or other debt financing in the future  could adversely affect the terms under which the company can borrow  and could increase the cost of new borrowings  other debt  or capital 
the company s operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  asbestos  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters  however  results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company 
the foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors nor necessarily present them in order of importance 
this disclosure  including that under outlook and forward looking statements and risk factors  and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by the company in this annual report and elsewhere from time to time  represents management s best judgment as of the date the information is given

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations 
to mitigate the company s exposure to these market risks  eastman has established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks 
the company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis  which measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and or commodity prices 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements 
currently  these borrowings are predominately us dollar denominated 
the nature and amount of the company s long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions  and other factors 
for and  the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  assuming an instantaneous parallel relative shift in interest rates of were approximately million and million  respectively  and an additional million for each one percentage point change in interest rates thereafter 
this exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates 
the company s operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business 
in order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk  the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and currency options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet committed export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than two years and denominated in foreign currencies 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
for  the market risks associated with forward exchange contracts utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model and a adverse move in the us dollar relative to each foreign currency hedged by the company were approximately million and an additional million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   the company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts or currency options 
further adverse movements in foreign currencies would create losses in fair value  however  such losses would not be linear to that disclosed above 
this exposure  which is primarily related to foreign currency options purchased by the company to manage fluctuations in foreign currencies  is limited to the dollar value of option premiums payable by the company for the related financial instruments 
furthermore  since the company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials 
to mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities  principally propane and natural gas  the company enters into forwards and options contracts 
for and  the market risks associated with feedstock options and natural gas swaps assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of were million and million  respectively  and an additional million and million for each one percentage point move in closing prices thereafter
