item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risks related to our business beginning on page and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leader in the distribution of avocados  processed avocado products  and other perishable food products throughout the united states and elsewhere in the world 
our history and expertise in handling california grown avocados has allowed us to develop a reputation of delivering quality products  at competitive prices  while providing a competitive return to our growers 
this reputation has enabled us to expand our product offering to include avocados sourced on an international basis  processed avocado products  and other perishable foods 
we report these operations in three business segments california avocados  international avocados and other perishable food products and processed products 
we report our financial results on a november to october fiscal year basis to coincide with the california avocado harvest season 
in order to diversify our product lines and increase synergies within the marketplace  we acquired all the outstanding common shares of maui fresh international  inc maui for  shares of our common stock valued at million in november  plus acquisition costs of  maui is a specialty produce company servicing a wide array of retail  food service  and terminal market wholesale customers with over different specialty commodities 
the value of our common stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition was based on the average quoted market price of our common stock for three days before and after the announcement date 
as security for certain potential contingencies  such as unrecorded liabilities  we held approximately  shares issued in conjunction with such acquisition for one full year from the acquisition date 
as no contingencies developed  which was in accordance with our expectations  we are in the process of releasing these shares to the original maui shareholders 
the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition 
the differences from the previously reported amounts of goodwill and intangible assets of  resulted from the finalization of our valuation information in the second quarter of fiscal in thousands fixed assets goodwill intangible assets total assets acquired current liabilities deferred tax liabilities net assets acquired our california avocado business grades  sizes  packs and cools avocados grown in california for delivery to our customers 
we presently operate two packinghouses in southern california 
these packinghouses handled approximately of the california avocado crop during the fiscal year  based on data obtained from the california avocado commission 
our operating results and the returns we pay our growers are highly dependent on the volume of avocados delivered to our packinghouses  as a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
our strategy calls for continued efforts in retaining existing growers  aggressively recruiting new growers  and procuring a larger percentage of the california avocado crop to improve our results from operations 
our international and perishable food products business procures avocados grown in mexico  chile  and the dominican republic  as well as other various commodities  including papayas  tomatoes  chili peppers  pineapples  and ginger 
we operate a packinghouse in mexico that handled approximately of the mexican avocado crop bound for the united states market during the mexican harvest season  based on our estimates 
additionally  during the chilean avocado harvest season  we handled approximately of the chilean avocado crop  based on our estimates 
our strategy is to procure and sell the internationally grown avocados to complement our distribution efforts of california grown avocados 
we believe that the introduction of these avocados  although competitive at times with california grown avocados  provides a level of supply stability that may  over time  help solidify the demand for avocados among consumers in the united states and elsewhere in the world 
we believe our efforts in distributing our other various commodities  such as those shown above  complement our offerings of avocados 
from time to time  we continue to explore distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to the business 

table of contents our processed products business procures avocados  processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products  and distributes the processed product to our customers 
in february  our board of directors approved a plan whereby the operations of our processed products business would be relocated 
the plan called for the closing of our santa paula  california and mexicali  baja california norte processing facilities and the relocation of these operations to a new facility in uruapan  michoacan  mexico 
we believe that this restructuring will provide cost savings in the elimination of certain transportation costs  duplicative overhead structures  and savings in the overall cost of labor and services 
the uruapan facility commenced operations in february and the santa paula and mexicali facilities were closed in february and august for fiscal year  we have incurred costs related to this restructuring approximating  our income statement for the year ended october  includes  as cost of sales   as special charges  and  as selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs are comprised of the following components as of and for the year ended october  reserves restructuring remaining in thousands charges amounts paid non cash charges to be utilized special charges employee separation costs selling  general and administrative freight cost of sales facility operating costs special charges recorded during the year ended october  consist entirely of employee separation costs 
all employee separation costs were paid in cash and represent final payments to production and managerial administrative employees formerly working at our mexicali processing facility 
we have not recorded a significant charge relating to the write down of production assets being held at our mexicali production facility  as substantially all such assets were re commissioned at our new facility in uruapan or their carrying value was less than their fair value 
processed products customers include both food service industry and retail businesses 
our strategy calls for the development of new guacamole recipes and other processed avocado products that address the diverse taste of today s consumers 
we also seek to expand our relationships with major food service companies and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace 
our california avocado and international and perishable food product businesses are highly seasonal and are characterized by rapid crop volume and price changes 
furthermore  the operating results of all of our businesses  including our processed products business  have been  and will continue to be  affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as pests and disease  weather patterns  changes in demand by consumers  the timing of the receipt  reduction  or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products on a timely basis  availability and cost of avocados and supplies from growers and vendors  new product introductions by our competitors  change in the mix of avocados and processed products we sell  and general economic conditions 
we believe  however  that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future 
on october   we completed a series of transactions whereby common and preferred shareholders of calavo growers of california  an agricultural marketing cooperative association  exchanged all of their outstanding shares for shares of our common stock 
concurrently with this transaction  the cooperative was merged into us with calavo emerging as the surviving entity 
these transactions had the effect of converting the legal structure of the business from a non profit cooperative to a for profit corporation 
the merger and the conversion were approved on an overwhelming basis by both the cooperative s shareholders and our board of directors 
prior to the merger  the cooperative reported results of operations as constituting either member the packing and distribution of avocados procured from either members or associate members or non member business non member business included both the processed product business and the sourcing and distribution of all crops that were not procured from the cooperative s members 
we have realigned our businesses to combine within our california avocado segment the results of operations of both the california avocados grown previously by members and those that were procured from non members 
we believe that this presentation provides an enhanced view of the results of our california operations and a better framework to evaluate the results of our various operations 

table of contents recent developments dividend payment in january  we paid a per share dividend in the aggregate amount of  to shareholders of record on november  corporate headquarters building in august  we entered into an agreement to sell our corporate headquarters building located in santa ana  california for million 
such transaction  however  fell out of escrow in november then  in december  we re entered escrow  with a different buyer  to sell our corporate headquarters building for the same sales price 
escrow related to such transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal  which is when we expect to complete the move of our corporate headquarters 
we estimate that this transaction will result in a pre tax gain on sale of approximately million  if such transaction is consummated according to terms 
we currently plan to relocate our corporate offices to santa paula  california 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables  inventories  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  promotional allowances  income taxes  retirement benefits  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
promotional allowances 
we provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale  based on our historical experience 
our estimates are generally based on evaluating the average length of time between the product shipment date and the date on which we pay the customer the promotional allowance 
the product of this lag factor and our historical promotional allowance payment rate is the basis for the promotional allowance included in accrued expenses on our balance sheet 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or when a possible impairment is indicated  using the fair value based test prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value  including goodwill 
we primarily use an income approach which considers the present value of future cash flows in combination with a market approach which considers what other purchasers in the marketplace have paid for similar businesses to determine fair value 
future cash flows typically include operating cash flows for the business for five years and an estimated terminal value 
management judgment is required in the estimation of future operating results and to determine the appropriate terminal values 
future operating results and terminal values could differ from the estimates and could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
allowance for accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has been made  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income  expressed as percentages of our total net sales  for the periods indicated year ended october  net sales gross margins selling  general and administrative operating income other income  net net income net sales we believe that the fundamentals for our products continue to be favorable 
government census studies continue to indicate a shift in the demographics of the us population in which larger portions of the population descend from a hispanic origin 
avocados are considered a staple item purchased by hispanic consumers and their acceptance as part of american cuisine continues to spur demand for our products 
we anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the united states marketplace driven by growth in the hispanic community and general acceptance in american cuisine 
as the largest marketer of avocado products in the united states  we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow all segments of our business 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has been made  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 
we provide for sales returns and promotional allowances at the time of shipment  based on our experience 
the following table summarizes our net sales by business segment change change dollars in thousands net sales california avocados international avocados and perishable food products processed products eliminations total net sales as a percentage of net sales california avocados international avocados and perishable food products processed products net sales for the year ended october   when compared to  grew by approximately million  or  principally as a result of growth experienced by our california avocados and international avocados and perishable food products segments 
in particular  growth in our net sales reflects an increasing percentage of our business being generated by our international avocados and perishable food product segments  which was driven primarily by additional sales related to the acquisition of maui fresh international  inc maui 
net sales generated by our international avocados and perishable food products business depends principally on the availability of chilean and mexican grown avocados in the us markets 
currently  mexican grown avocados are significant during our first two fiscal quarters 
chilean grown avocados are significant during our st and th fiscal quarters 
in  the united states department of agriculture usda established a protocol whereby mexican grown hass avocados were permitted to be imported  on a restricted basis  into the united states 
restrictions imposed on the marketing of the fruit  due to phytosanitary concerns  limited the marketing of mexican hass avocados to states  from the middle of october to the middle of april 
in november  however  the usda published a rule allowing hass avocado imports from mexico into all states  with the exception of california  florida  and hawaii 
the exception extends for two years 
for the remaining states  however  avocados exports are set to start february  while we believe that we are well positioned to respond to such legislation  we are unable to project the impact  if any  the adoption of this new rule would have on our financial condition and results of operations

all intercompany sales are eliminated in our consolidated results of operations 
california avocados net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase in sales reflects a increase in pounds of avocados sold  partially offset by a decrease in our average selling prices when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase in pounds sold was consistent with the increase in the overall harvest of the california avocado crop for the season 
our market share of california avocados remained consistent at for fiscal year  compared to for the same period in the prior year 
for fiscal year  average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for california avocados were lower when compared to the same prior year period 
this pricing structure primarily reflects the impact of a larger california avocado harvest 
for fiscal year  we believe that the year round introduction of imported avocados in the us marketplace will put increasing pressure on sales prices  principally as a result of an increase in volume 
net sales delivered by the business decreased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this decrease in sales primarily reflects a decrease in avocados sold  partially offset by a significant improvement in the average selling prices of avocados when compared to fiscal the decrease in pounds sold is consistent with the decrease in the overall harvest of the california avocado crop for the season  as well as a shift in growing areas where we do not command as significant a market share 
despite this decrease in volume  we continued to maintain our leadership role in packing and marketing california grown avocados 
our market share of first grade hass variety avocados was approximately and during fiscal and 
table of contents for the season  we attribute such decrease in market share primarily to the aforementioned shift into growing areas where we do not command as significant a market share among growers 
for fiscal year  average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for california avocados were higher when compared to fiscal year we attribute some of the increase in these average selling prices to increasing demand for california grown avocados in the us marketplace and a reduced volume of avocados 
we believe that our investments in focused marketing activities  combined with promotional programs established by the california avocado commission  have generally had a positive effect on average sales prices 
our strategy is to continue to develop marketing opportunities that favorably position avocados packed by calavo with our customers by emphasizing existing value added services  such as fruit bagging and ripening 
we believe that these and other value added strategies are critical elements in sustaining competitive average selling prices 
in october  the usda announced the creation of a hass avocado board to promote the sale of hass variety avocados in the us marketplace 
the california avocado commission  which receives its funding from california avocado growers  has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales 
the new hass avocado board now provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the us marketplace including imported and california grown fruit 
we believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the us will  in the long term  positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our california avocado and international avocado businesses 
during fiscal and  we remitted approximately million and million to the hass avocado board representing our share of such marketing expenses 
international and perishable food products for fiscal year  when compared to the same period in the prior year  sales to third party customers increased by approximately million  or  from million to million 
the increased sales to third parties by our international and perishable food products business were primarily driven by the additional sales related to the acquisition of maui in november  as well as increased sales of mexican and dominican republic grown avocados in the us  japanese  and or european marketplace 
these increases  however  were partially offset by decreased sales of chilean grown avocados 
we believe that sales of mexican grown avocados will continue to show a growing trend 
we intend to leverage our position as the largest packer of mexican grown avocados for export markets to improve the overall performance of this business 
for fiscal year  the additional sales related to the acquisition of maui totaled approximately million approximately million of such sales were related to california avocados 
also  sales of mexican and dominican republic sourced fruit increased million and million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period  primarily as a result of a and increase in pounds of mexican and dominican republic fruit handled 
such increases  however  were partially offset by decreases in chilean fruit sales 
for fiscal year  sales of chilean sourced fruit decreased million when compared to the same prior period 
this was primarily the result of a decrease in the volume of chilean fruit handled  when compared to the same prior year period 
pricing during fiscal year was fairly stable as well  when compared to fiscal for fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  sales to third party customers increased by approximately million  or  from million to million 
the increased sales to third parties by our international and perishable foods products business were primarily driven by a greater volume of chilean and mexican grown avocados penetrating into the us  japan and europe marketplaces 
the volume of fruit handled increased by million pounds of chilean grown avocados  or  and million pounds of mexican grown avocados  or  for fiscal when compared to fiscal pricing during fiscal was fairly stable as well  when compared to fiscal during fiscal year  we sourced a significantly greater volume of mexican grown avocados from our uruapan  mexico packinghouse 
during fiscal  the volume of fruit related to shipments to the us marketplace increased by approximately million pounds  or  as compared to fiscal in addition  net sales resulting from the sale of mexican grown avocados were also favorably impacted by increased demand from japanese and european customers 
during fiscal  the volume of fruit related to shipments to japan and europe increased by approximately million pounds  or  as compared to fiscal processed products net sales to third party customers decreased by approximately million  or  from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the decrease in net sales to third party customers is primarily attributable to a decrease in million pounds of product sold  or  and an increase in sales incentives and promotional activities paid of million  or  partially offset by an increase in the sales price per product pound sold of  or 
during fiscal year  the decrease in pounds sold primarily relates to a lack of inventory to meet customer demand 
such lack of inventory was primarily related to 
table of contents reduced production capabilities during construction of our new processed facility 
as a result  and  in order to maintain good customer relationships  we increased our sales incentives and promotional activities paid 
net sales to third party customers increased by approximately million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in fiscal net sales to third party customers is primarily attributable to an increase in million pounds of product sold  or  an increase in the sales price per product pound sold of  and a decrease in sales incentives and paid promotional activities of million or 
during fiscal  we experienced an increase in demand for our frozen processed products as one of our competitors exited from the business 
as a result of the increase in demand for our product  we decreased our sales incentives and promotional activities paid 
during fiscal year  we purchased and commissioned new ultra high pressure treatment equipment designed to manufacture processed avocado products that are not frozen 
during fiscal year  we operated two separate high pressure lines  consisting of one ultra high pressure machine manufacturing guacamole in mexicali and another in uruapan 
the machine in mexicali was commissioned for operations in october and ran near capacity during fiscal through the closure date of mexicali  which was august the machine in uruapan  which has a much larger capacity than the mexicali machine  was commissioned for operations in july and ran at about capacity through october we anticipate that we will operate such high pressure machine at or near full capacity during fiscal year we plan to re commissioning the high pressure machine that was located in mexicali to uruapan during fiscal as well 
utilizing avocado pulp and chunks  these high pressure machines allow us to deliver fresh guacamole to retail and food service customers 
sales of our high pressure product totaled approximately million for fiscal year we believe that the introduction of these fresh guacamole products will  in the long term  successfully address a growing market segment 
gross margins the following table summarizes our gross margins and gross profit percentages by business segment change change dollars in thousands gross margins california avocados international avocados and perishable food products processed products total gross margins gross profit percentages california avocados international avocados and perishable food products processed products consolidated our cost of goods sold consists predominantly of fruit costs  packing materials  freight and handling  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with preparing food products  and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold 
consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  decreased for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year this decrease was principally attributable to decreased profitability in our international avocados and perishable food products operating segment and our processed product segment  partially offset by increased profitability in our california avocado segment 
consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  decreased for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year this decrease was principally a result of decreases in the gross profit percentages realized by our california avocado and processed products segments  which were partially offset by increased gross profit percentages achieved by our international avocado and perishable food products segment 
gross margins and gross profit percentages for our california avocado business are largely dependent on production yields achieved at our packinghouses  current market prices of avocados  and the volume of avocados packed 
the increase in our gross margin percentage during fiscal year was primarily related to a significant increase in pounds of fruit handled 
during fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  fruit handled by our california packinghouses increased approximately 
this had the effect of reducing our per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
the decrease in our gross margin percentage during fiscal year was primarily related to a higher average return per pound paid to our growers 
our growers received an average return of per pound  as compared to per pound in fiscal the volume of avocados delivered by our growers decreased  however  by approximately million pounds 
during fiscal  freight and handling costs increased by approximately million  from million in fiscal to million during fiscal during fiscal  freight and handling costs decreased by approximately million  from million in fiscal to million 
we continue to review our packinghouse processes for potential improvements in packing efficiencies and more favorable production yields 

table of contents the gross margin and gross profit percentage for our international avocado and perishable food products business are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party domestic packers 
for example  the gross margins we earn on avocados procured from chile and the dominican republic  as well as papayas grown in hawaii  are generally based on a commission agreed to with each packer that is subject to incentive provisions 
these provisions provide for us to deliver returns to these packers that are competitive with those delivered by other handlers 
accordingly  the gross margin results for this business are a function of the volume handled and the competitiveness of the sales prices that we realize as compared to others 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations include sales and cost of sales from the sale of avocados and perishable products procured under consignment arrangements 
for fiscal year  we generated gross margins of million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties  whereas gross margins for fiscal year were million 
for fiscal year  we generated gross margins of million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties  whereas gross margins for fiscal year were only million 
our business with mexican growers differs in that we operate a packinghouse in mexico and purchase avocados directly from the field 
consequently  the gross margin and gross profit percentages generated by our mexican operations are significantly impacted by the volume of avocados handled by our packinghouse and the cost of the fruit 
during fiscal year  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados deteriorated from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  principally as a result of an increase in fruit costs 
this increase in fruit costs had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  adversely affected gross margins 
further  we experienced an increase in sales of non exported fruit  which typically generate lower margins then exported fruit 
these decreases  however  were partially offset by increases in fruit volume during fiscal year  which had the effect of reducing our per pound costs 
during fiscal year  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados improved from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  principally as a result of increases in the pounds packed at our facility 
for fiscal year  the additional gross margin related to the acquisition of maui totaled approximately million approximately million of such gross margin was related to california avocados 
gross margins and gross profit percentages for our processed products business are largely dependent on the pricing of our final product and the cost of avocados used in preparing guacamole 
during fiscal year  the processed products gross profit percentages decreased primarily as a result of inefficiencies experienced in the start up process of our newly constructed facility in uruapan  mexico and the winding down of the operations at our mexicali  mexico facility 
such inefficiencies primarily relate to subcontracting costs and duplicative overhead costs 
additionally  our processed product segment experienced higher fruit costs  as well as an increase in the sale of products that generate a lower gross margin then those sold in the prior year 
during fiscal year  the decrease in the gross margin percentage is primarily related to higher fruit costs  as well as inefficiencies related to the relocation of production from santa paula  california and mexicali  mexico to our newly constructed facility in uruapan  mexico 
additionally  as a result of the closure of our santa paula processed facility and greater then expected increase in demand for our products  we depleted our inventory at a rate greater than initially planned 
therefore  we entered into agreements and or discussions with two processed avocado product suppliers to supplement our existing inventory levels 
this had the effect of decreasing our gross margin percentage due to higher costs and inefficiencies related to sourcing this product from outside suppliers 
we anticipate that the gross profit percentage for our processed product segment will continue to experience fluctuations primarily due to the uncertainty of fruit costs that will be used in the production process 
selling  general and administrative change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses include costs of marketing and advertising  sales expenses  and other general and administrative costs 
for fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  compared to fiscal year the increased general and administrative costs related principally to selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by maui 
maui s selling  general and administrative expenses totaled approximately million for fiscal year additionally  we also experienced higher costs of corporate functions  such as accounting  information systems  and human resources totaling approximately million 
these increased costs were partially offset by reduced employee compensation expenses of approximately million  which was primarily related to a reduction in bonuses during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million from fiscal to the increase is attributable principally to million of additional marketing expenses  million of transportation costs associated with the relocation of the processed product operations  and million in incentives paid to employees

our effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year primarily as a result of a favorable reduction in our foreign tax rates during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year our effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year primarily as a result of a reduction in non deductible transaction costs and a favorable reduction in our state and foreign tax rates during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year the effective income tax rate for fiscal year is higher than the federal statutory rate principally due to state and foreign taxes and certain non recurring transaction costs related to our conversion from a cooperative to a for profit corporation that were non deductible for tax purposes

increases in our accounts receivable balance as of october   when compared to october   primarily reflect the additional receivables related to the acquisition of maui  as well as a significantly higher volume of california avocado sales recorded in the month of october  as compared to october similarly  the amounts payable to our growers also reflects the increase in the volume of california avocados marketed in the month of october  as compared to october these volume levels are consistent with the harvests experienced in previous years 
additionally  increases in our inventory balance as of october   when compared to october   primarily reflect a significantly higher amount of finished processed product  as we began building our inventories during fiscal year in conjunction with the completion of our processed product uruapan facility 
increase in advances to suppliers as of october   when compared to october   primarily relates to delays in the start of the chilean avocado harvest  which resulted in slower collections on our advances 
increases in our trade accounts payable and accrued expenses as of october   when compared to october   primarily reflect the additional trade accounts payable and accrued expenses from the acquisition of maui 
the decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets as of october   when compared to october   was primarily a result of the capitalization of a deposit and progress payments related to our large high pressure machine in uruapan  as such machine was placed into service during fiscal year cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for fiscal years   and fiscal year cash flows used in investing activities include capital expenditures of million  principally related to the construction of our new processed operations facility in uruapan  michoacan  mexico
