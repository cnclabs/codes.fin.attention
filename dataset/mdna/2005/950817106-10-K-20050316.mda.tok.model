item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in reviewing this item  attention is directed to item  selected financial data  and item  business 
overview financial condition wesco continues to have a strong balance sheet at december   with relatively little debt and no hedging 
liquidity  which has traditionally been high  has been even higher than usual for the past two years due principally to sales  maturities and early redemptions of most of wesco s mortgage backed securities and other fixed maturity investments and reinvestment of the proceeds in cash equivalents pending redeployment  mainly in the first half of wesco s equity investments are in strong  well known companies 
the practice of concentrating in a few issues  rather than diversifying  follows the investment philosophy of the chairmen ceos of wesco and its parent  berkshire  who consult with respect to wesco s investments and major capital allocations 
results of operations no investment gains or losses were realized in investment gains were realized in for the first time in three years 
decisions to sell investments at wesco are made without regard to the 
table of contents effect on periodic earnings  and the amounts and timing of realizations have no predictive or practical analytic value 
as explained in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  a pre tax gain of approximately million  based on current trading prices  is expected to be realized in ignoring realized investment gains  improved operating results of the furniture rental and industrial segments were responsible for an increase in after tax operating earnings in  following a decline in such earnings in  when insurance underwriting results were more than offset by reduced investment income that resulted from the shift from longer term to very short term fixed maturity investments bearing lower interest rates  and the furniture rental and industrial segments suffered from the effects of the ongoing weak economy and other unfavorable factors 
wesco does not manage with a view toward wall street expectations 
its management is not concerned with the volatility of short term operating results  so long as long term prospects are satisfactory 
financial condition wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion per share  up from billion per share at december  shareholders equity included million at december   and million at december   representing appreciation in market value of investments  which is credited directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes  without being reflected in earnings 
because unrealized appreciation is recorded using market quotations  gains or losses ultimately realized upon sale of investments could differ substantially from recorded unrealized appreciation 
net unrealized appreciation constituted approximately of shareholders equity at december  and at december  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  as well as notes and to wesco s accompanying consolidated financial statements  for additional information on investments 
wesco s consolidated cash and cash equivalents  held principally by its insurance businesses  increased from billion at december  to billion at december  wesco s consolidated borrowings totaled million at december  versus million at december  of these amounts  million and million related to a million revolving line of credit used in cort s furniture rental business 
in addition to this recorded debt  wesco and its subsidiaries had operating lease and other contractual obligations at december  of million  down from million a year earlier 
wesco s liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at december  totaled million versus million at december  the decline was attributable primarily to losses paid in connection with the commutation of a reinsurance contract by wes fic in the fourth quarter of see item  business  page  for further information on the commutation 
wesco s management believes the wesco group has adequate liquidity and capital resources to provide for any contingent needs that may arise 
borrowings from banks and others have been available to wesco and its subsidiaries under attractive terms for a number of years 
wes fic enjoys standard poor s corporation s highest rating  aaa  with respect to its claims paying ability 
results of operations the consolidated data in the second table in item are set forth essentially in the income statement format customary to generally accepted accounting principles gaap

insurance segment following is a summary of the results of operations of the insurance segment ie  wes fic and kbs  which represent the combination of underwriting results with dividend and interest income

earned premiums for  and included million  million and million attributable to wes fic  and million  million and million attributable to kbs 
at december   wes fic s in force reinsurance business consisted of a contract under which it was participating in various pools of aviation related risks 
under the contract  written premiums in  and totaled million  million and million and earned premiums were million  million and million 
the decline in written aviation reinsurance premiums for was caused mainly by increased competition 
prices in certain aviation markets declined  resulting in fewer opportunities to write business at prices considered acceptable 
also  wes fic s participation dropped  its participation in the aviation pools has generally varied from year to year 
during  wes fic also participated in a multi year contract covering certain multi line property and casualty risks of a large  unaffiliated insurer under a contract entered into in that contract was commuted in the fourth quarter of at which time wes fic paid the ceding company million  cash  representing all unearned premiums  reduced by unamortized costs and 
table of contents expenses 
after the commutation  wes fic s obligation to indemnify with respect to any further insurance losses under the contract ceased 
under that contract  there was a net reduction in written premiums of million for  compared with written premiums of million and million for and  earned premiums were million  million and million  respectively 
premiums written by kbs for  and were million  million and million 
the decrease in its written premiums in resulted from a change in the cost of ceded reinsurance  premiums written  before the purchase of reinsurance  increased slightly for the year 
the increases in premiums written by kbs in recent years have been principally due to growth in volume of bank deposit guarantee bonds  this product currently accounts for approximately of premiums written by kbs 
premiums earned by kbs for those years were million  million and million 
for  and  reinsurance generated underwriting gains  before income taxes  of million  million and million 
included in those amounts were underwriting gains of million  and million relating to the aviation contract 
underwriting results in also included a pre tax gain of million including million in the fourth quarter associated with the aforementioned commuted contract 
this contract produced pre tax underwriting losses of million in and million in kbs underwriting gains were million  million and million for  and unlike wes fic  kbs writes numerous  relatively small insurance policies  and thus management considers overall combined ratios the sum of insurance losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses divided by premiums to be meaningful 
kbs combined ratios were  and for  and wesco s insurers cede minimal amounts of business  and as a result  underwriting results may be volatile 
management accepts volatility provided the prospects of long term profitability remain favorable 
since september   the insurance industry has been particularly concerned about its exposure to claims resulting from acts of terrorism 
as explained in item  business  in spite of partial relief provided by the terrorism risk insurance act  enacted in  wes fic is exposed to insurance losses from terrorist events 
although wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to such losses from an insurance standpoint cannot be predicted  wes fic s management does not believe it likely that  on a worst case basis  wes fic s shareholders equity would be severely impacted by future terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
it should be noted that the commutation of the multi line property and casualty contract in resulted in the return to the ceding company of all remaining liability relating to the terrorist activity of september  other industry concerns in recent years have been exposures to losses relating to environmental contamination and asbestos 
wes fic s management currently believes such exposures to be minimal 
dividend and interest income has been earned by the insurance segment principally from the investment of shareholder capital including reinvested earnings as well as float premiums received before payment of related claims and expenses 
dividend and interest income earned by the insurance segment declined in each of the past two years from the corresponding figure principally because proceeds from sales  maturities and early redemptions of long term  fixed maturity investments were reinvested in lower yielding  short term investments and cash equivalents 
this shift occurred since the end of  principally during the first half of

the number of furniture leases at yearend was about higher than at yearend after having steadily declined over since the peak level attained in late management believes that the downward trend in dollars and units has possibly ended 
management attributes the downward trend prior to mainly to a slowdown in new business formation and business failures notably in the high technology industry  exacerbated to some degree by the terrorist activity on september  furniture sales revenues decreased in and in from those of each previous year 
cort  in managing the level of excess  idle inventory  periodically discounts selling prices  as it did in  resulting in higher than normal sales revenues 
apartment locator fees for  all generated by relocation central  decreased million  or  from those reported for  after increasing million  or from those for principally through acquisitions 
since late in  relocation central s operations have been undergoing reorganization in order to reduce operating losses 
some of its walk in facilities have been merged into cort s facilities  and others have been closed  resulting in significant cost and expense reductions 
the reduction in relocation central s revenues has been more than offset by a reduction in its costs and expenses  discussed below 
cost of rentals  sales and fees amounted to of revenues for versus for and for the decreases in cost percentages for and reflect improved rental margins  as well as lower depreciation expense in each year  in spite of a writedown of obsolete and excess inventories by million in  and lower apartment locator lead acquisition costs 
purchases of new inventory increased slightly in after declining generally for several years  rental furniture is depreciated under the declining balance method  whereby recorded depreciation is higher in the first year and declines in each successive year

the million improvement in the operating results in is primarily attributable to the aforementioned reductions in operating expenses 
the minority interest in net loss of subsidiary of million in relates to a period of several months during which relocation central was an owned subsidiary of cort

industrial segment following is a summary of the results of operations of the industrial segment  consisting of the businesses of precision steel and its subsidiaries 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services income loss before income taxes income taxes segment net income loss for several years prior to  the operations of industrial segment suffered due to various factors including the following a prolonged economic downturn  a shift of production by many manufacturers from domestic to overseas facilities  periodic shortages of product from domestic mills  and extraordinary competitive pressures 
not only was there a decline in the number of orders placed  but there was also a trend towards smaller sized orders 
the severity of the impact on the business is demonstrated by the fact that average annual segment revenues for the years through were down from those reported for through segment revenues for decreased from the corresponding figure  pounds of steel products sold decreased 
at the beginning of  a shortage of raw materials from domestic mills produced near chaos in the steel service industry 
fortunately  the impact on wesco s industrial segment revenues to date has been favorable 
segment revenues for increased million  or  from those of pounds of steel products sold increased 
domestic steel mills have been operating at capacity and imported steel has not been readily available 
these and other factors have enabled steel mills to 
table of contents raise prices  place limits on order quantities and extend delivery times 
precision steel has reacted to these pressures by passing the price increases  plus normal mark ups  on to customers  and favoring long term customer relationships 
however  management is concerned that the favorable segment operating results may have been anomalous and temporary and that the steel warehouse business may revert to difficult times 
as explained in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  precision steel and a subsidiary are involved in an environmental matter the ultimate cost of which is difficult to estimate 
segment operating results include provisions of million 
million after income taxes in and million million after income taxes in  representing preliminary estimates of costs of remediation agreed to with governmental entities and other parties to date and related expenses 
management anticipates that additional provisions with respect to such remediation and other legal matters may be required in the future  but does not anticipate that the ultimate impact of such provisions will be material in relation to wesco s shareholders equity  although it believes that the effect on industrial segment and consolidated net income in any given period could be material 
even without the provisions for remediation discussed above  operations of the industrial segment for would have resulted in a loss before income taxes of 
million  versus pre tax income of million for and 
million for income or loss before income taxes of the industrial segment is dependent not only on revenues  as was the case in  but also on operating costs and the cost of products sold 
the latter  as a percentage of revenues  amounted to  and for  and the cost percentage typically fluctuates slightly from year to year as a result of changes in product mix and price competition at all levels 
precision steel s cost of products sold percentage is very sensitive to current changes in the cost of materials purchased  because it carries its inventories at the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market  under this method  the most recent costs are reflected in cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for included adverse lifo inventory accounting adjustments of million million  after income taxes 
lifo adjustments were insignificant in  but increased earnings by million million after income taxes for unrelated to business segment operations set forth below is a summary of items increasing decreasing wesco s consolidated net income that are viewed by management as unrelated to the operations of the insurance  furniture rental and industrial segments 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  realized investment gains  before income tax effect income taxes realized investment gains other nonsegment items rental income from commercial real estate dividend and interest income real estate and general and administrative expenses other items  net income before income taxes income taxes net income from other nonsegment activities realized gains and losses on wesco s investments have fluctuated in amount from year to year  sometimes impacting net income significantly  as in and however  the amounts and timing of these realizations have no predictive or practical analytical value 
wesco s investments are carried at market value  and unrealized gains or losses are reflected  net of potential income tax effect  in the 
table of contents unrealized appreciation component of its shareholders equity 
when gains or losses are realized  due to sale of securities or other triggering event  they are credited or charged to the consolidated statement of income  generally  in wesco s case  there has been little effect on total shareholders equity essentially only a transfer from unrealized appreciation to retained earnings 
wesco s consolidated earnings contained net realized investment gains  after income taxes  of million in and million in  no gains or losses were realized in  or see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information as to a pre tax gain of approximately million expected to be realized in other nonsegment items include mainly rental income from owned commercial real estate and dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries  reduced by real estate and general and administrative expenses plus or minus income taxes related to such items 
these taxes do not correlate well with total pre tax income  primarily because dividend income is substantially tax exempt 
wesco s effective consolidated income tax rate typically fluctuates somewhat from period to period based mainly on the relation of dividend income  which is substantially exempt from income taxes  to other pre tax earnings or losses  including realized investment gains  which are fully taxable 
the respective income tax provisions  expressed as percentages of income before income taxes  amounted to  and in  and see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
management s principal goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments 
investments may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire to generate funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
consolidated revenues  expenses and net income reported for any period are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and net income in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of investment gains and losses  as well as other unusual nonoperating items such as a large acquisition 
in addition  consolidated revenues  expenses and net income are subject to external conditions such as the september  terrorist activity  which had an immediate impact on wes fic s underwriting results  and changes in the economy  which have adversely affected cort and precision steel in recent years 
as explained in item  business  in spite of relief provided by enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act tria in  wes fic is exposed to losses from terrorist events covered by tria occurring after that date as well as terrorism losses not covered by tria 
although wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to terrorism losses cannot be predicted  wes fic s management does not believe that  on a worst case basis  wes fic s shareholder s equity would likely be severely impacted by any terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
shareholders equity is impacted not only to the extent that unusual items affect earnings  but also to reflect changes in unrealized appreciation of investments  which are not reflected in earnings 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its business operations have potential exposure  particularly in the insurance and industrial segments 
large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  making their earnings susceptible to inflationary and deflationary cost changes  the 
table of contents impact  though not material in relation to wesco s consolidated net income  may be significant to that of the industrial segment  due particularly to the segment s use of lifo inventory accounting 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations neither wesco nor any of its subsidiaries has off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations discussed below 
nor do they have any insurance obligations for which estimated provisions have not been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or notes thereto 
wesco and its subsidiaries have contractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities  which will result in cash payments in future periods 
certain of those obligations  such as notes payable  are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  wesco and its subsidiaries have entered into long term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future  which are not currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements and will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided 
a summary of contractual obligations follows 
amounts are in thousands 
payments due total subsequently notes payable  including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations  other than for capital expenditures other  principally deferred compensation totals critical accounting policies and practices wesco s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the significant accounting policies and practices followed by wesco are set forth in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
following are the accounting policies and practices considered by wesco s management to be critical to its determination of consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions based on evaluation of facts and circumstances using information currently available 
although the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses included in the consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from those that might result from use of estimates and assumptions based on facts and circumstances not yet available  wesco s management does not believe such differences would have a material adverse effect on reported shareholders equity 
liabilities for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses as of any balance sheet date represent estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under property and casualty reinsurance and insurance contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
as of that date  some incurred claims have not yet been reported and some of these may not be reported for many years  the liability for unpaid losses includes significant estimates for these claims 
additionally  reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
each claim is settled individually based upon its merits  and some take years to settle  especially if legal action is involved 
actual ultimate claims amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
changes in estimates are recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of change 
provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported in the consolidated statement of income after deducting estimates of amounts that will be recoverable under reinsurance contracts 
reinsurance contracts do 
table of contents not relieve the ceding companies of their obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance contracts 
goodwill of acquired businesses represents the difference between purchase cost and the fair value of net assets of acquisitions 
at least annually  goodwill is reviewed for impairment using a variety of methods  and impairments  if any  are charged to operating earnings 
prior to  gaap required the amortization of goodwill 
the appropriate classifications of investments in securities with fixed maturities and marketable equity securities are established at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
there are three permissible classifications held to maturity  trading  and  when neither of those classifications is applicable  available for sale 
in recent years wesco s management has classified all of its equity and fixed maturity investments as available for sale  they are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of income taxes  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
insurance premiums are recognized as earned revenues in proportion to the insurance protection provided  which in most cases is pro rata over the term of each contract 
unearned insurance premiums are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
certain costs of acquiring premiums are deferred in other assets on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  and charged to income as the premiums are earned 
furniture rentals are recognized as revenue proportionately over the rental contract period  rentals received in advance are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
related costs comprise the main element of cost of products and services sold on the consolidated income statement and include depreciation expense  repairs and maintenance and inventory losses 
rental furniture consists principally of residential and office furniture which is available for rental or  if no longer up to rental standards or excessive  for sale 
it is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost  less accumulated depreciation calculated primarily on a declining balance basis over to years using estimated salvage values of to percent of original cost 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet contains substantial amounts of investments whose estimated fair carrying values are subject to market risks 
values of marketable equity securities are subject to fluctuations in their stock market prices  and values of securities with fixed maturities are subject to changes in interest rate levels 
apart from investments  the consolidated balance sheet at december  did not contain significant assets or liabilities with values subject to these or other potential market exposures such as those relating to changes in commodity prices or foreign exchange rates 
wesco does not utilize derivatives to manage market risks 
equity price risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of marketable equity securities stated at market value  up from million one year earlier 
the increase was due to an increase in market values  no marketable equity securities were purchased or sold during the carrying values of wesco s equity securities are exposed to market price fluctuations  which may be accentuated by the concentration existing in the equity portfolio 
at december   two investments comprised of the carrying value of the consolidated equity portfolio 
in addition  the businesses represented by the equity investments are exposed to risks related to other markets 
the two largest holdings of the consolidated group at december  million  combined were common stocks of the coca cola company and the gillette company  both of which have global operations and thus are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these and other market risks to which these investees are subject  such as commodity price fluctuations  are required  where material  to be reported upon in the filings these companies make with the sec  which are available to the public 

table of contents strategically  wesco strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management  at sensible prices 
wesco s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee  resulting in concentration 
most equity investments are expected to be held for long periods of time  thus  wesco s management is not ordinarily troubled by short term price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
wesco strives to maintain above average levels of shareholders equity to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized upon the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative prices of alternative investments  or general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized upon the sale of a particular security may be adversely affected if a relatively large quantity of the security is being sold 
the following table summarizes wesco s equity price risks as of december  and it shows the effects of a hypothetical overall increase or decrease in market prices of marketable equity securities owned by the wesco group on total recorded market value and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity at each of those dates 
amounts are in thousands 
december  december  increase decrease increase decrease market value of marketable equity securities as recorded hypothetical shareholders equity as recorded hypothetical the hypothetical changes in market values assumed in preparing the tables do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
indeed  actual results could be much worse or better due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentration existing in wesco s equity investment portfolio 
interest rate risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of securities with fixed maturities stated at fair value  down from million one year earlier 
the decrease resulted from maturities and redemptions of such securities during the year 
proceeds received were mainly invested in us treasury notes and investments maturing within three months cash equivalents  as a result  cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet increased from billion to billion during consequently  market value risks with respect to interest rate movements or otherwise as of december  are considered insignificant 
the fair values of wesco s fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values 
fair values of wesco s investments may also be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
as noted in the preceding section on equity price risk  wesco prefers to acquire entire businesses or invest in equity securities 
when unable to do so  it may invest in mortgage backed securities  
table of contents government bonds or other interest rate sensitive investments 
wesco s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to perceived interest rate and credit risks 
although wesco s emphasis is conservative  it recognizes and accepts that losses may occur
