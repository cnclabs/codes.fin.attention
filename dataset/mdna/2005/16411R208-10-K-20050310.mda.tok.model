freeport lng freeport lng is developing an lng receiving terminal with an anticipated regasification capacity of bcf d 
we developed this project and then sold a limited partner interest to an affiliate of the general partner of freeport lng and a limited partner interest to another unaffiliated party 
we continue to own a limited partner interest in freeport lng 
freeport lng has received authorization from ferc to commence construction of the freeport lng facility 
in order to complete certain phases of the project  freeport lng will be required to satisfy remaining conditions specified by ferc 
construction began in the first quarter of  and we currently expect that terminal operations will commence in in june  dow signed an agreement with freeport lng for the potential long term use of the receiving terminal beginning with commercial start up of the facility expected to occur in in  dow entered into a year tua with freeport lng providing for a firm commitment by dow for the use of mmcf d of regasification capacity 
in december  conocophillips and freeport lng signed an agreement under which conocophillips would reserve approximately bcf d of regasification capacity in the freeport lng receiving terminal 
conocophillips would also obtain a interest in the general partner of freeport lng and provide a substantial majority of the financing to construct the facility 
freeport lng received a non refundable capacity reservation fee of million from conocophillips in january the conocophillips transaction closed in july  at which time conocophillips paid freeport lng an additional non refundable million to secure an option on mmcf d of additional capacity in the event the terminal is expanded 
sabine pass lng our owned limited partnership entity  sabine pass lng  is developing an lng receiving terminal with an initial regasification capacity of bcf d

table of contents in september  sabine pass lng entered into a tua to provide total with approximately bcf d of lng regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng receiving terminal 
in november  total exercised its option to proceed with the transaction by delivering to sabine pass lng an advance capacity reservation fee payment of million and a guarantee by total sa of certain total obligations under the tua 
cheniere  sabine pass lng and total also entered into an omnibus agreement in september  under which the tua remains subject to certain conditions described above under items and business and properties lng receiving terminal development our lng receiving terminals sabine pass lng total tua 
the tua provides for total to pay a fee of per mmbtu  subject in part to adjustment for inflation  for approximately bcf d of regasification capacity for a year period beginning not later than april  in addition  under the omnibus agreement  if sabine pass lng enters into a new tua with a third party  other than cheniere affiliates  for capacity of mmcf d or more  with a term of five years or more  prior to the commercial start date of the terminal  total will have the option  exercisable within days of the receipt of notice of such transaction  to adopt the pricing terms contained in such new tua for the remainder of the term of the total tua 
because total has elected to proceed with the transaction  an additional advance capacity reservation fee payment of million will be payable to sabine pass lng under the total omnibus agreement upon receiving evidence of the ability to finance construction of the facility  which will be deemed satisfied if an acceptable epc contractor has accepted the notice to proceed with construction

chevron usa is required to make advance capacity reservation fee payments to sabine pass lng totaling up to million  of which million has been paid 
further advance capacity reservation fee payments are due as described below under liquidity and capital resources lng terminal development sabine pass lng 
we estimate that the cost of constructing the bcf d sabine pass lng facility will be approximately million to million  before financing costs and contingencies 
in december  we entered into a lump sum turnkey agreement with bechtel at a cost of million 
our cost estimate is subject to change due to such items as cost overruns  change orders and changes in commodity prices particularly steel 
in february  a change order for million was approved  thereby increasing the total contract price to million 
on february   sabine pass lng entered into an million senior secured credit facility  or credit facility  with a syndicate of financial institutions 
soci t g n rale serves as the administrative agent and hsbc securities usa inc serves as collateral agent 
the credit facility will be used to fund a substantial majority of the costs of constructing and placing into operation the sabine pass lng receiving terminal 
corpus christi lng we own a limited partner interest in corpus christi lng  which is developing an lng receiving terminal with a regasification capacity of bcf d 
we are marketing bcf d of capacity under long term tuas of per mmbtu  the same price contracted for at sabine pass 
we intend to market the remaining 
table of contents capacity under other long term  mid term and or short term contracts 
however  we may not be able to obtain any tuas for corpus christi on terms acceptable to us at that price  or at all 
we currently anticipate that  by the second quarter of  ferc will issue an order authorizing construction of this terminal  which will likely be subject to specified conditions that must be satisfied prior to commencement of construction 
construction is anticipated to begin in the third quarter of  with terminal operations commencing in creole trail lng we own a limited partner interest in creole trail lng 
in november  we announced the acquisition of an option on a proposed lng site at the mouth of the calcasieu channel in cameron parish  louisiana  which we refer to as creole trail lng 
we plan to develop creole trail in the same manner as our sabine pass lng facility  though it will be a larger facility with two docks  four  cm storage tanks and an initial regasification capacity of bcf d 
we anticipate marketing bcf d of capacity under long term tuas at per mmbtu  the same price contracted for at sabine pass lng 
we intend to market the remaining capacity under other long term  mid term and or short term contracts

construction is anticipated to begin in the third quarter of  with terminal operations commencing in other activities in december  we entered into an option agreement with j s cheniere an entity in which we are a minority owner  providing j s cheniere with an option to purchase lng regasification capacity of up to mmcf d in each of our sabine pass and corpus christi lng facilities 
we were paid million in connection with the execution of the option agreement by j s cheniere in january the option agreement may be terminated by j s cheniere and the option fee refunded in the event that ferc does not issue an order authorizing cheniere lng to construct at least one of the facilities or if cheniere lng decides not to proceed with the development of at least one of the facilities  in either case  before december  j s cheniere may exercise the option as to each facility by entering into a tua no later than days after receipt of written notification by us that ferc has issued an order authorizing construction of at least one of the facilities and all other approvals and permits have been received that are necessary to begin construction of the facility 
as part of our overall energy business strategy  we are pursuing additional potential lng receiving terminal projects  downstream opportunities and upstream opportunities 
we are also engaged  to a lesser extent  in oil and gas exploration and development activities in the gulf of mexico 
liquidity and capital resources lng terminal development we are primarily engaged in developing lng receiving terminals 
these lng terminal projects will require significant amounts of capital and are subject to risks and delays in completion 
even if successfully completed  these projects will not begin to operate and generate significant cash flows until several years from now 
as a result  our business success will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to obtain the funding necessary to construct these lng terminals  to bring them into operation on a commercially viable basis and to finance the costs of staffing  operating and expanding our company during that process 
we own a limited partner interest in freeport lng  a limited partner interest in sabine pass lng  a limited partner interest in corpus christi lng and a limited partner interest in creole trail lng 
we currently estimate that  in the aggregate  these four terminal projects will require in excess of billion  before financing costs and contingencies  to construct and place in service 
in addition  we have related potential pipeline projects in different stages of development 
these projects and the other downstream and upstream opportunities we are pursuing  if successfully pursued  will also require significant amounts of capital 

table of contents in january  we initiated the marketing of regasification capacity for our proposed sabine pass and corpus christi lng receiving terminals 
we have been actively engaged in the marketing process since that time  seeking long term  creditworthy anchor tenant tua contracts for our planned regasification capacity 
upon execution of each tua  we typically receive an advance payment for regasification capacity sold 
this provides additional capital to help meet our ongoing liquidity needs 
furthermore  these tuas are designed to serve as collateral to facilitate project level debt financing that we intend to obtain with respect to the construction of the related lng receiving terminal 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
we must augment our existing sources of cash with significant additional funds in order to carry out our business plan 
we currently expect that capital requirements for the four current lng terminal projects will be financed in part through issuances of project level debt  equity or a combination of the two and in part with net proceeds of debt or equity securities issued by cheniere or other cheniere borrowings 
our anticipated capital requirements and financing plans for the four current lng terminal development projects follow 
freeport lng we developed the freeport lng project and received cash proceeds of million in connection with the disposition in february of a limited partner interest to an affiliate of the general partner of freeport lng which  in december  sold a limited partner interest to a subsidiary of dow and the disposition in march of a limited partner interest to another unaffiliated party

conocophillips has also paid freeport lng an aggregate of million in connection with the reservation of approximately bcf d of lng regasification capacity at the terminal and million for options of up to mmcf d of additional capacity in the event the terminal is expanded 
under the limited partnership agreement of freeport lng  development expenses of the freeport lng project and other freeport lng cash needs generally are to be funded out of freeport lng s own cash flows  borrowings or other sources  and  up to a pre agreed total amount  with capital contributions by the limited partners 
in december and february  we received notices from the general partner of freeport lng stating that its affiliated limited partner s pre agreed total capital contributions would be made and that additional capital contributions were being called for from all limited partners to fund a portion of freeport lng s budgeted expenditures 
we presently intend to fund our pro rata share  or approximately million  of these capital calls  which covered the period december through june additional capital calls may be made upon us and the other limited partners in freeport lng 
in the event of each such future capital call  we will have the option either to contribute the requested capital or to decline to contribute 
if we decline to contribute  the other limited partners could elect to make our contribution and receive back twice the amount contributed on our behalf  without interest  before any freeport lng cash flows are otherwise distributed to us 
we currently expect to evaluate freeport lng capital calls on a case by case basis and to fund additional capital contributions that we elect to make using cash on hand  revenues from advance capacity reservation fees and funds raised through the issuance of cheniere equity or debt securities or other cheniere borrowings

in addition  during we recorded equity in the loss incurred by freeport lng attributable to our limited partner interest  which reduced our investment basis to zero as of december  in january  we received the final million payment from freeport lng 
because our investment basis in freeport lng had been reduced to zero  the payment was recorded as a reimbursement from limited partnership investment in our consolidated statement of operations for in  our equity share of the net loss from freeport lng was million  including  of loss that was suspended as of december  see note to consolidated financial statements 
this compares to our equity share of the loss of million for the significant improvement between periods for freeport lng was a result of freeport lng s receipt of a non refundable fee of million from conocophillips in january general and administrative expenses general and administrative  or g a  expenses primarily relate to our general corporate and other activities 
these expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in g a resulted primarily from the expansion of our business including increases in average corporate staff from an average of employees in to an average of employees in 
corporate employee related costs for also included cash bonuses of million 
table of contents and non cash compensation of million which included unrestricted and restricted stock awards related to our and company performance 
we capitalize as oil and gas property costs that portion of g a expenses directly related to our exploration and development activities 
we capitalized million in compared to  in depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses dd a expenses increased  or  to million in from  in the increase primarily resulted from higher oil and gas dd a as a result of an increase in our dd a rate from per mcfe to per mcfe and higher production volumes discussed below 
dd a also increased as a result of more depreciation expense resulting from the acquisition of furniture  fixtures and equipment associated with the expansion of our business 
interest and other income interest and other income increased to  in from  in primarily because of an increase in our cash balance resulting from our million public equity offering of our common stock in december before related offering costs of million 
in addition  we received million in advance regasification capacity payments in november and december of and raised million in net cash proceeds related to a private placement of our common stock and exercises of options and warrants to purchase our common stock during oil and gas activities oil and gas revenues increased by million  or  to million in from  in as a result of a increase in production volumes  mcfe in compared with  mcfe in and an increase in average natural gas prices to per mcf in from per mcf in we produced from an average of wells in as compared with an average of wells in we incurred little or no production cost in and because all of our revenues were generated from non cost bearing overriding royalty interests  or orri  until december the small amount of production costs in is attributable to our share of production taxes on two producing wells located in texas state waters and operating costs attributable to a well converted from an orri to a working interest at payout in december results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended december  and overview our financial results for the year ended december  reflect a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  in the major factors contributing to our loss in were lng receiving terminal development expenses of million which were offset by a million minority interest in the operations of corpus christi lng  our equity share of the loss in freeport lng of million and general and administrative expenses of million 
these factors were offset by a million gain on the sale of lng assets and a  gain on the sale of a limited partnership interest in freeport lng 
lng terminal development activities our principal focus in both and was the development of lng receiving terminals 
as a result  receiving terminal development expenses represented a major part of our operating costs and expenses for both years 
in  we phased out our direct involvement in developing the freeport  texas  site  but we accelerated the schedule of receiving terminal development at sabine pass  and near corpus christi 
accordingly  gross receiving terminal development expenses  before any cost recoveries  were higher in million than in million 
in  we formed a limited partnership to develop the corpus christi lng receiving terminal 
we are the general partner of the limited partnership  and throughout we owned a limited partner interest 
we recorded million in receiving terminal development expenses related to this site in  however  this amount was completely offset by the minority interest of our partner who provided funding for all development costs in the remainder of our receiving terminal development expenses primarily related to the sabine pass lng site  where we own of the project  and lng employee related expenses 

table of contents in  we incurred million in receiving terminal development expenses for the freeport lng receiving terminal 
we entered into an agreement in august to sell a interest in the receiving terminal in exchange for payments to us totaling million over time and payments to others of up to million for expenses  which were already incurred or were to be incurred in connection with the development of the freeport lng receiving terminal 
during  million in such development expenses were charged to the purchaser 
this recovery reduced our receiving terminal development expenses reported for to million 
in february  our freeport lng receiving terminal project was acquired by freeport lng in which we retained a limited partnership interest in addition to the consideration described above 
in connection with the sale of lng assets to freeport lng  we reported a gain of million 
furthermore  we sold a interest in freeport lng in march for million  resulting in a gain of  throughout  we received payments totaling million from freeport lng  which amounts were recorded as a reduction to our investment in the partnership 
in addition  our limited partner interest in the operations of freeport lng resulted in our recording equity in the net loss of the partnership of million for this non cash loss reduced our investment in freeport lng to zero 
general and administrative expenses g a expenses relate to our general corporate and other activities 
these expenses increased  or  to million in compared to million in the principal components of g a are employee compensation and contracted services  legal fees and travel 
we incurred more legal expenses in in connection with securities compliance filings and increased securities registration costs 
we traveled more in as we increased our profile among the investment community and as we developed an lng trading venture based in europe 
oil and gas activities oil and gas revenues increased by  or  to  in from  in as a result of increased production volumes  mcfe in compared with  mcfe in and increased average natural gas prices of per mcf in from per mcf in we had production from an average of seven wells in as compared with one well in we incurred no production costs in because all of our revenues were generated from non cost bearing orri 
production costs in totaled  and related to the early months of before we sold our cost bearing working interests in oil and gas properties 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate on january   we began accounting for our interest in gryphon on the cost method of accounting because we no longer had sufficient board representation to provide us with the opportunity to exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the company 
in  we accounted for our investment in gryphon using the equity method of accounting  and our equity share of gryphon s losses was million 
other matters critical accounting estimates and policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical 
however  not all situations are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in these cases  we must use our best judgment to adopt a policy for accounting for these situations 
we accomplish this by analogizing to similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them  and often consult with our independent accountants about the appropriate interpretation and application of these policies 

table of contents accounting for lng activities because we have been in the preliminary stage of developing our lng receiving terminals  substantially all of the costs to date related to such activities have been expensed 
these costs primarily include professional fees associated with front end engineering and design work and obtaining an order from ferc authorizing construction of our terminals and other required permitting for the sabine pass lng  corpus christi lng and creole trail lng receiving terminals and their related natural gas pipelines 
land costs associated with lng terminal sites are capitalized 
costs of certain permits are capitalized as intangible lng assets 
we have also capitalized costs related to options to purchase or lease land that may be used for potential lng terminal sites 
revenue recognition lng regasification capacity fees are recognized as revenue over the term of the respective tuas 
advance capacity reservation fees are initially deferred 
full cost method of accounting we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all productive and non productive exploration and development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  together with internal costs directly attributable to property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
interest is capitalized on oil and gas properties not subject to amortization and in the process of development 
the costs of our oil and gas properties  including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and the carrying amounts of any asset retirement obligations  are depreciated using a composite unit of production rate based on estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  then the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
net capitalized costs are limited to a capitalization ceiling  calculated on a quarterly basis as the aggregate of the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves based on current economic and operating conditions  but excluding asset retirement obligations  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties  less related income tax effects 
our allocation of seismic exploration costs between proved and unproved properties involves an estimate of the total reserves to be discovered through our exploration program 
this estimate includes a number of assumptions that we have incorporated into a three year plan 
such factors include an estimate of the number of exploration prospects generated  prospect reserve potential  success ratios and ownership interests 
we transfer unproved properties to proved properties based on a ratio of proved reserves discovered at a point in time to the estimate of total reserves to be discovered in our exploration program 
the carrying value of unproved properties is evaluated for possible impairment by comparing it to the estimated future net cash flows associated with the estimated total reserves to be discovered in our exploration program 
to the extent that the carrying value of unproved properties is greater than the estimated future net revenue  any excess is transferred to proved 
it is reasonably possible  based on the results obtained from future drilling and prospect generation  that revisions to this estimate of total reserves to be discovered could affect our capitalization ceiling 
sales of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil and gas reserves 
we account for the retirement of our tangible long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires 
table of contents us to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
subsequently  the asset retirement costs included in the carrying amount of the related asset are allocated to expense using the unit of production method used to depreciate oil and gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the reserve data included in this annual report are only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this annual report for is based on estimates prepared by sharp petroleum engineering  inc estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
the present value of future net cash flows does not necessarily represent the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves 
if the estimate of proved reserves declines  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the company  such as stock options and restricted stock 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the apb opinion no 
and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we currently account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic method pursuant to apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires that all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  be recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas no 
r will be effective for periods beginning after june  accordingly  we will be required to apply sfas no 
r beginning in the fiscal quarter ending september  we are currently assessing the provisions of sfas no 
r and its impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the development of our lng receiving terminal business is based upon the foundational premise that prices of natural gas in the us will be sustained at levels of per mcf or more 
should the price of natural gas in the us decline to sustained levels below per mcf  our ability to develop and operate lng receiving terminals could be significantly negatively affected 
we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil and condensate 
as a result  our financial results can be affected as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
we had not entered into any derivative transactions as of december  we have cash investments that we manage based on internal investment guidelines that emphasize liquidity and preservation of capital  and such cash investments are stated at historical cost which approximates fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet
