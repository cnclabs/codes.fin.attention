item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a global supplier of broadband wireless access bwa equipment that allows communications service providers often referred to as local exchange carriers  or simply telephone companies  internet service providers often referred to as isps and other telecommunications users  such as utilities and enterprises  to cost effectively deliver high speed data and voice services using radio frequencies rather than wires 
we call this transmission method broadband wireless 
the primary market for our systems has historically been a subset of the fixed and broadband wireless access systems market  which is the point to multipoint market in radio frequencies below ghz 
on march   we announced the introduction of products that also provide bwa to nomadic and portable applications 
each of our wireless access systems utilizes digital wireless techniques  which provide wide area coverage  security and resistance to fading 
our systems can be deployed rapidly and cost effectively  providing an attractive alternative or complement to traditional copper wire  cable  or fiber optic communications access networks 
our products also include software tools that optimize geographic coverage of our systems and provide ongoing network management 
to facilitate the deployment and operation of our systems  we also offer network installation  training and support services 
a more complete description of our various wireless access systems is provided below 
our bwa systems the airspan bwa solutions have been installed by more than network operators in more than countries and are being tested by numerous other service providers 
our initial products were developed and sold originally to provide wireless voice connections between network operators and their end customers 
product enhancements introduced in enabled us to offer both voice and data connectivity over a single wireless link 
we have continued to develop the capabilities and features of the original products  and today we sell them as the as and as products  in systems capable of delivering high capacity broadband data with carrier quality voice connections to operators globally 
in october  we strengthened our position in the bwa equipment market with the acquisition of the wipll wireless internet protocol in the local loop business from marconi marconi wipll pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  and renamed the business airspan networks israel limited airspan israel 
the products and services produced by airspan israel enable operators in licensed and unlicensed wireless bands to offer high speed  low cost  wireless broadband connections for data and voice over ip 
we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and debt of marconi wipll in exchange for million of cash 
in october  we began marketing our as and as product range of airspan branded high end point to multipoint and point to point products suitable for operators wishing to deliver service offerings to medium and large businesses and multi tenant dwellings that require considerable bandwidth for their end users 
these products  based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ofdm technology  can also be used for a wide range of backhaul applications  for example connecting remote base stations to a central office 
in december   we acquired the fixed wireless access business of nortel networks known as proximity in accordance with the terms and conditions of a contemporaneously executed and delivered purchase and sale agreement 
the acquired proximity products and enable operators to provide carrier class circuit switched voice and data services  based on a time division multiple access tdma technology 
we acquired inventory relating to the proximity business as well as existing assets associated with the manufacture  development and support of the proximity product line 
we also assumed the product supply obligations associated with customer contracts and certain other liabilities and obligations along with the workforce of persons directly employed in the proximity business 
the final purchase price was million 
on december  we signed a letter of intent to acquire arelnet limited tase arnt  an israeli company providing voice over ip voip network infrastructure equipment and solutions  including soft switches and gateways supporting major voip standards 
in accordance with the letter of intent  we expect to acquire all of the outstanding securities of arelnet for an aggregate purchase price of million  of which million would be paid in cash and million in shares of airspan 
on march  we announced the introduction of a new product line known as as 
max 
as 
max is a full portfolio of wimax systems  base stations and customer premise equipment cpe  all based on the ieee standard 
the as 
max product range is designed to serve both our traditional fixed point to multipoint bwa market  and new markets such as the bwa market for nomadic and portable applications 
we intend to continue our strategy of expanding our business through  among other things  acquisitions of other businesses and technologies and joint ventures 
see risk factors our failure to manage future acquisitions 
our corporate headquarters are located in boca raton  florida 
our primary operations  manufacturing and product development centers are located in uxbridge  uk and airport city  israel 
we generated revenue of million in  million in and million in we have incurred net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
since becoming an independent company  we have generated significant net losses and negative cash flow and expect to continue to do so in we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we generate revenue from sales of our systems including both hardware and software and from services related to implementation and support activities 
revenue from services has always been under of our total revenue 
see management s discussion and analysis critical accounting policies for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
our proprietary software is integral to our products and is not sold separately 
customer service contracts are generally of a short term nature  for days and weeks rather than months and are sold separately from sales of our systems 
service revenue does not currently constitute a material portion of our revenue 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force and  to a lesser extent  through distribution channels 
we have direct sales offices in the us  us  australia  brazil  china  czech republic  germany  indonesia  new zealand  the philippines  poland  russia  south africa and sri lanka 
we also sell through independent agents and resellers in markets where we do not have a direct sales presence and to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who may sell our products under their name 
our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable and typically varies from one month to two years  often involving extensive testing and evaluation by prospective customers  which makes it difficult for us to anticipate the quarter in which particular sales may occur 
in  our non us sales accounted for of our total revenue and our top ten customers accounted for of our revenue 
in  our non us sales accounted for of our total revenue and our top ten customers accounted for of our revenue 
in  our non us sales accounted for of our total revenue and our top ten customers accounted for of our revenue 
we currently derive  and expect to continue to derive  a substantial percentage of our revenue from fewer than ten customers 
in the year ended axtel in mexico represented of our revenue 
in the year ended december  broadcast communications ltd in new zealand represented of our revenue 
in the year ended december   siemens telecommunications pty ltd 
in south africa and speednet inc in japan represented and respectively  of our revenue 
we anticipate that our dependence on our ten largest customers will continue in  primarily due to our projected sales of proximity solutions to axtel 
the following table identifies the percentage of our revenue by geographic region in the periods identified 
percentage of revenue geographic area year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  united states asia pacific europe africa and middle east south and central america and caribbean while we expect that sales to axtel will still comprise a large percentage of our revenues for  we anticipate that the percentage of our sales to central america will decrease in cost of revenue consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  warranty costs  royalties  overhead related to manufacture of our products and customer support costs 
our gross margin is affected by changes in our product mix because our gross margin on base stations and related equipment is higher than the gross margin on subscriber terminals 
in addition  our gross margin is affected by changes in the average selling price of our systems  volume discounts granted to significant customers and the proportion of total revenue of sales of software  which typically carries a higher gross margin than hardware 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline and we intend to continue to implement product cost reductions and develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in an effort to maintain or increase our gross margins 
further  we expect to derive an increasing proportion of our revenue from the sale of our integrated systems through distribution channels 
revenue derived from these sales channels typically carries a lower gross margin than direct sales 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel and expenses for design  development and testing facilities and equipment 
these expenses also include costs associated with product development efforts  including consulting fees and prototyping costs from initial product concept to manufacture and production 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related costs for personnel  sales commissions  consulting fees and expenses for advertising  travel  technical assistance  trade shows  and promotional and demonstration materials 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures related to sales and marketing activities including costs associated with the recruitment of additional sales and marketing personnel and for the expansion of our distribution channels 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel  professional and consulting fees and other related expenses and facilities costs 
we outsource all of our manufacturing processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful debt  excess or obsolete inventory  warranty costs  restructuring costs  the valuation goodwill  and legal proceedings 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may change as future events occur 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are dependant on significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met an arrangement exists with the customer  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price for the product or service is fixed or determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
product revenue revenue from product sales  including sales to distributors and resellers  is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue is deferred when customer acceptance is required  rights of return exist  or other significant obligations remain that are essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
revenue is recognized when these conditions have been satisfied 
the estimated cost of any post sale obligations  including basic product warranties  is accrued at the time revenue is recognized based on historical experience 
service revenue revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized once the services have been performed 
revenue from service contracts that relate to a period of cover is recognized ratably over the given contract period 
revenue is recognized on fixed price service contracts using the percentage of completion method unless it is not possible to make reasonable estimates under that method  in which case revenue is recognized on a completed contract basis 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliveries in certain cases  we enter into agreements with customers whereby we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or multiple services multiple deliveries 
in these transactions  we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements based on their relative fair value 
revenue for these transactions is recognized on each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that element 
revenue is recognized for delivered products and services only if i the above product revenue or service revenue criteria are met  ii undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  iii payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services  and iv the fair value for each of the undelivered elements is known 
under our revenue recognition policy we are required to assess the credit worthiness of our customers 
we use our own judgment in assessing their credit worthiness  and the criteria by which each judgment is made may change in future periods and therefore may change future revenue recognition 
accounts receivable we are required to assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable balances 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including  but not limited to  the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves have been recorded in recent periods to reflect our current judgment  and changes may occur in the future due to the market environment 
should we consider it necessary to increase the level of reserves required for a particular customer or customers then additional charges will be recorded in the future 
inventory we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
as a result  we exercise judgment as to the level of provisions required for excess and obsolete inventory 
these judgments are based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
during recent periods we have made provisions against inventory reflecting the decline in our expectations of the demand for certain of our products 
should we decide in the future that actual market conditions have become less favorable  or our assumptions change due to changing market conditions  additional inventory provisions may be required 
warranty costs typically our products are covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs required to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs or our assessment of future conditions change  our warranty accrual will increase  which will result in decreased gross profit 
restructuring during  and we recorded restructuring charges arising from our cost reduction programs and established reserves which include estimates pertaining to employee termination costs  the loss on subletting excess facilities  and the write down of assets to be disposed of as part of the restructuring 
when providing for restructuring charges we make estimates as to the expected costs to be incurred  particularly with respect to the costs of excess facilities 
estimates of future income from sub letting excess facilities are made that offset expected future costs 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from the amount of the reserves 
purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions  we assess the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
items such as accounts receivable  fixed assets  intangible assets and accrued liabilities require a high degree of judgment involving assumptions and estimates including future cash flows and discount rates 
in certain situations  where we deem necessary  we may use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
we used the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions of the marconi wipll business in and for the proximity business in during  we made adjustments to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities of the proximity business 
see note to the financial statements 
tax and deferred taxes research and development tax credits during we recorded a tax credit relating to research and development expenditure in the united kingdom 
see note to the financial statements 
the inland revenue has the right to audit claims made for research and development tax credits and  until the authorities have approved the claims  there is potential uncertainty as to whether the final claim will be accepted 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets 
as at december   we recorded a valuation allowance  effectively writing down our deferred tax assets to zero 
we consider our future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to determine whether our valuation allowance is appropriate 
the main factors we consider are our cumulative losses in recent years  our net loss for the current period and our future earnings potential determined through the use of internal forecasts 
should we decide in the future that a lower valuation allowance is required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would result in income being recorded in the period that that determination was made 
other taxes we are subject to local taxes in each country that we have a permanent establishment or other taxable presence 
we make estimates of our potential liability to tax in these jurisdictions  which estimates are subject to examination by the local tax authorities 
derivative instruments we are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of certain currencies to the us dollar  particularly uk pounds sterling and new israeli shekels 
from time to time  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to cash flow hedge a portion of our sterling operating expenses  primarily salary and facility lease expenses 
we make assumptions with respect to the timing of entering into these contracts and the number of periods that we hedge and consider the value of our sterling obligations and the forecasted exchange rate 
should the actual exchange rate be more favorable than the hedged rate at the time of execution of the contract  we would incur a loss on that particular contract 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in  we recorded a gain of million related to forward exchange contracts 
in  we do not expect to record a significant gain in respect of forward exchange contracts 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets on january   fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  was implemented and as a result  we ceased to amortize our goodwill 
we were required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets was compared to its implied fair value by using the expected present value of future cash flows 
for the review a weighted average cost of capital  equivalent to triple c junk bonds  of and an effective tax rate of was used 
the result of this review was that no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets was recorded during the year ended december  in the impairment review  we make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge that would adversely affect our results 
legal proceedings we are subject to class action complaints related to alleged false and misleading information in our registration statement and prospectus see item legal proceedings  and may also face litigation for labor and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to changes in circumstances within each case 
results of operations the following table provides operating data as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue cost of revenue inventory provision gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing bad debt expense general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring provision total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net income taxes net loss restructuring in the third quarter of  a restructuring program was initiated to reduce operating expenses

the total number of employees terminated as part of this restructuring program was and all severance payments were made by the end of the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of we decided to completely outsource all of our manufacturing 
as a result  we recorded a thousand restructuring charge for the closure of our riverside  uxbridge facility in the entire amount of this cost relates to the closure of this facility 
a further thousand was recognized as a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  when the company reassessed its ability to sublease the riverside facility 
all cash outflows arising from this will be made by the end of in the second quarter of  an additional restructuring program was initiated to further lower operating expenses 
the total cost incurred as part of this restructuring program was thousand arising from costs associated with facility closures and severance 
the costs incurred during the year ended december  for this restructuring program related to termination costs for employees 
all of these employees had left the company by december  during the first quarter of we revised our original restructuring programs and initiated a new program to further reduce operating expenses 
this program was completed by the end of the third quarter of the total cost incurred for this restructuring program was thousand related to termination costs for employees 
all of these employees had left the company by december  in conjunction with the purchase of the proximity business  we implemented our plan to relocate the proximity business from maidenhead  england and sunrise  florida to our facilities in uxbridge  england and boca raton  florida 
we recorded acquisition related restructuring charges of thousand in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the relocation of the proximity business 
the estimated relocation costs were reduced during the year to thousand 
the adjustment formed part of the revised fair value adjustments of the proximity acquisition 
this relocation plan was completed by december  we recorded significant acquisition related restructuring charges in connection with the relocation of the proximity business 
all figures in us thousands accrued at acquisition paid in revision to preliminary fair value adjustments accrued at december  office closure other associated costs the restructuring charges and their utilization are summarized as follows all figures in us thousands balance at beginning of period restructuring charge accrued on acquisition utilized balance at end of period year ended december  one time termination benefits contract termination costs other associated costs year ended december  one time termination benefits contract termination costs other associated costs year ended december  facility related severance and other included in the restructuring charge was thousand for the write down of certain fixed assets used at tradeshows and the riverside facility 
all charges  other than the fixed asset write downs  have or will result in direct cash outlays 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december revenue revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million increase in revenue is primarily attributable to sales of proximity products to axtel  representing of our revenue for we project that a significant amount of our revenues in will come from a limited number of customers 
see risk factors we currently depend on a few key customers 
cost of revenue and inventory provision cost of revenue increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the increase in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  our cost of revenue was in and in during both and  we wrote down amounts of inventory to reflect our view of the demand for our as inventory 
in  we made inventory provisions in the aggregate amount of million to reflect our view that  with the full introduction of the new as product line in that year  demand for as equipment had lessened 
in the third quarter of  we provided for an additional million provision related to excess as inventory  reflecting our revised estimates of the demand for this product 
gross margin increased to in from for the year of the increase in gross margin in relative to was primarily due to smaller inventory provisions in  the allocation of certain relatively fixed period costs over a significantly larger revenue base in and the increased sale of higher margin products in research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the additional research and development expenses we incurred in connection with the acquisition of the proximity business in the fourth quarter of and expenses associated with the development of our new wimax portfolio 
in  we expect to continue to invest heavily in wimax related research and development projects and  in connection with our proposed acquisition of arelnet  we expect to incur additional costs related to the development of voip products 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to the increase in revenue relating to the acquisition of the proximity business

during  we wrote down receivables by million due to our concerns with customers in asia and africa 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of costs incurred in preparing to meet the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles expense increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase arose from the amortization of intangibles identified after our acquisition of the proximity business in the fourth quarter of restructuring provision during both and  we implemented expense reduction programs 
during  we made restructuring provisions totaling million to cover employee termination costs and a revision of our estimates of costs associated with the closure of our riverside facility in during  we charged million to restructuring expense related to additional employee termination costs 
for more information regarding our restructuring programs  see the section above entitled restructuring 
interest and other income net interest and other income net  which increased from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   consisted of gains and losses on foreign currency cash balances and foreign exchange hedging contracts and interest earned on cash deposits with financial institutions 
income taxes an income tax credit of million was recorded in the year ended december  we received a million tax credit related to the benefit granted to us by the uk tax authorities  which we received in lieu of carrying forward tax losses related to research and development costs 
we surrendered approximately million of carry forward tax losses in the united kingdom as a result 
the tax credit was partially offset by tax charges relating to a foreign branch of airspan communications limited  uk acl and certain franchise taxes relating to the us operations of airspan 
no income tax benefit has been recorded for the tax losses generated because we have incurred operating losses since inception 
the tax charge of thousand relates to a foreign branch of the acl 
net loss for the reasons described above  our net loss before taxes decreased from million in to million in and our net loss decreased by from million in to million in comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december revenue revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million increase in revenue is attributable to an increase in revenues in the first half of relative to the first half of revenue growth was principally driven by growth in asia pacific  primarily by sales to broadcast communications in new zealand  and in europe  partly as a result of sales by airspan israel  which we acquired in october cost of revenue and inventory provision cost of revenue increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the increase in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  our cost of revenue was in and in during both and we wrote down material amounts of inventory 
as a result of the depressed revenue for the first six months of  we reassessed the levels of excess and obsolete inventory and decided to write down inventory by million in the second quarter of during the second quarter of we took a million inventory provision to reflect our view that  with the full introduction of the new as product line in the quarter  demand for as equipment had lessened 
gross margin declined to in from for the year of the decline in gross margin was a function of lower average selling prices  a change in product mix and an increase in inventory provisions 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase was due to the additional research and development expense of the airspan israel business purchased in the fourth quarter of sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to the increase in revenue partially offset by our expense reduction programs 
we have been able to sell the airspan israel products through our existing sales network 
we anticipate that the sales and marketing expenses associated with the proximity business will increase the absolute level of sales and marketing expenses in by approximately million 
in we wrote down receivables by million due to our concerns with customers in asia and eastern europe 
during we wrote down receivables by million due to our concerns with customers in asia 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of the full year effect of our cost reduction programs  including reductions in personnel and our relocation from our original headquarters in sunrise florida to smaller offices in boca raton 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles expense increased from thousand in the year ended december  to thousand in the year ended december  the increase arose from the amortization of intangibles identified after our fourth quarter acquisition of airspan israel 
restructuring provision during both and we implemented expense reduction programs 
during  we made restructuring provisions totaling million to cover employee termination costs and facility closure costs 
as part of this million we recorded a million restructuring charge for the closure of our riverside  uxbridge facility 
the closure of this facility was a direct result of the decision to fully outsource all of our as and as product manufacturing 
during we charged million to restructuring expense related to further employee termination costs and an increase in the estimated closure costs of the riverside facility 
for more information regarding restructuring  see the section above entitled restructuring 
interest and other income net interest and other income  which increased from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   consisted of gains and losses on foreign currency cash balances and foreign exchange hedging contracts and interest earned on cash deposits with financial institutions 
the increase in foreign currency exchange gains were partially offset by lower interest income from lower cash balances and lower interest rates in amounts from interest income were partially offset by interest expense of thousand in the year ended december  and thousand in the year ended december  interest expense decreased in as a result of the repayment of debt 
income taxes an income tax provision of thousand recorded in the year ended december relates to a foreign branch of the united kingdom company but no income tax benefit has been recoded for the tax losses generated because overall operating losses have been experienced since inception 
the tax credit relates to the receipt of million from the uk tax authorities in lieu of carrying forward tax losses related to research and development costs 
the company surrendered million of carry forward tax losses in the united kingdom 
as a result 
net loss for the reasons described above  our net loss before taxes decreased from million in to million in and our net loss increased by from million in to million in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million of restricted cash 
of this restricted cash million is held as collateral for performance guarantees on one customer contract and with landlords and million is for payments made by employees under our employee share purchase plan 
we do not have a line of credit or similar borrowing facility  nor do we have any material capital commitments 
since inception  we have financed our operations through private sales of convertible preferred stock  which have totaled million net of transaction expenses and an initial public offering of common stock  which we completed on july  in the initial public offering  we issued  shares of common stock for approximately million in cash net of underwriting discounts  commission and other expenses 
in our most recent private sale of convertible preferred stock  which we closed in september  we raised million through the issuance of series a preferred stock to oak investment partners xi  limited partnership 
in november  we also raised million through the sale of treasury stock that was acquired through a share buy back program completed in we have used the proceeds of the sale of all securities for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
at december  and  we had no outstanding debt 
until we are able to generate cash from operations  if ever  we intend to use our existing cash resources to finance our operations 
we believe we have sufficient cash resources to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
for the year ended december   we used million cash in operating activities compared with million for the year ended december  the difference between our net loss of million and the million cash used in operating activities principally arose from decreasing inventory of million and an increase in accounts payable of million partially offset by an increase in receivables of million and a decrease in customer advances of million 
during we reduced our inventory by million and our receivables by million 
the cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  all related to capital equipment purchases of million 
the net cash provided in investing activities for the year ended december  of million arose from the sale of investment securities of million along with net cash proceeds from acquisitions of million  partially offset by capital equipment purchases of million 
our financing cash flow for the year ended december  of million was dominated by the issuance of million of preferred stock 
additional to this we raised million through the sale of our treasury stock and another million from the exercise of stock options and stock issued under out employee share purchase plan 
our financing cash flow for the year ended december  was a net outflow of million 
the outflow arose from a repayment of long term debt of million and a million purchase of treasury stock partially offset by a million decrease in restricted cash and net proceeds from issuance of common stock of million 
restricted cash increases whenever the company issues a guarantee secured by cash collateral and decreases whenever such a guarantee is cancelled or expires according to its terms 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period all figures in us thousands total thereafter contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations as of december   the company had commitments with its main sub contract manufacturers under various purchase order and forecast arrangements  to a value of  thousand and with other suppliers for capital equipment  to a value of thousand 
the company has bank guarantees with its landlords and a customer totaling  thousand at december  the guarantees secure payment or performance obligations of the company under contracts 
the company has pledged cash to the banks as collateral for the guarantees in the same amounts as the guarantees 
this pledged cash has been classified as restricted cash 
we have no material commitments other than operating leases  supplier purchase commitments and forward exchange contracts mentioned herein 
see item a and note of the notes to the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents plus restricted cash of million and million  respectively 
substantially all of these amounts consisted of highly liquid investments with purchase to maturity terms of less than days 
these investments are exposed to interest rate risk  but a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by two percentage points from december  rates would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an insignificant amount 
due to the short duration of these investments  a short term increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
declines in interest rates over time would  however  reduce our interest income 
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken to mitigate this  and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis does not take into account any such action 
foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december   of our sales were denominated in us dollars and the remaining were predominantly denominated in euro 
comparatively for the year ended december   of our sales were denominated in us dollars and the remaining were denominated predominantly in euro 
our total euro denominated sales for the year ended december  were million us million  which were recorded at an average exchange rate of us compared to total euro denominated sales for the year ended december  of million us million which were recorded at an average exchange rate of us 
if the average exchange rates used had been higher or lower during by they would have decreased or increased the total non us dollar denominated sales value by million 
we expect the proportions of sales in euro to fluctuate over time 
the company s sensitivity analysis for changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in changes in sales volumes 
since may  we have from time to time entered into fair value currency hedging contracts that lock in minimum exchange rates for payments due to us under some of our sales contracts where those payments are to be made in currencies other than us dollars 
we do not enter into any currency hedging activities for speculative purposes 
there was no impact from such contracts during on earnings  nor were there any fair value hedges outstanding at december  we will continue to monitor our foreign currency exposures and may modify our hedging strategies  as we deem appropriate 
we have also entered into cash flow currency hedges 
our operating results are affected by moves in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the rate between us dollars and us pounds sterling and the us dollar and the israeli shekel 
this is because most of our operating expenses  which may fluctuate over time  are incurred in pounds sterling and israeli shekels 
to manage our pound foreign currency risk we have  at various times in and and  forecast our likely net spending in non us dollars until march  and  based on these forecasts  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to cover a percentage of the projected exposure
